    "Comment": "I like the initiative of these women to create a podcast about women in crypto/blockchain. What I do not or less like is the title of this podcast \"The Women Effect\", for example; transfer yourself in a (young)women at scool and you see the name of this podcast what do you think?, it's the first impression that counts. This (young)women will not know what it's about at first impression when she read this name. I think the title needs more identity regarding Cardano, block-chain or crypto.\n\nAlso I do not think that this podcast is a pure women or political statement, it's about the awaireness of women who also can participate in blockchain or crypto. Cardano is about the financial independency of every human. There are a lot of women who are depended of a man in the thirth world countrys but also in the western world. This podcast will make some changes and awaireness at that level I am sure of that.",

    "Comment": "Hi,\n\nI really like the concept of having competing education platforms and really like the proposal - more detailed than others.\n\nJust going to layout couple of my questions here.\n\n1) One thing I am conscious of is that there is a 6 months of funding allocated in the budget with 1 month of content laid out of detail - perhaps it would be clearer if you could drill down on what the plan is for the additional 5 months. Just from a very high level, maybe you're planning a monthly theme... per video / blog post etc?\n\n2) Also, if it is worthwhile providing videos on generally what is blockchain, what are smart contracts then build up on how Cardano leverages these concepts and ideas. Is this something the platform could cater for or will the plaform focus purely on use cases?\n\n3) Will the videos follow the same pattern as something like Cardano effect with asking questions etc, or will it be more of a direct content on how to use Plutus playground / building your first Dapp/ Smart Contract/ Stake pool etc..\n\nI'm just trying to understand who the main community target here is.. bringing new stake pool ops, devs, or the general population?\n\nThanks.\n\nTodsy",

If these videos/podcasts attracts new generation of developers and they in turn contribute to the growth of the cardano ecosystem, is he getting benefitted from that ?\n\nin other words can we as a community work together to create a platform that integrates the different media platforms and have a unified way to reward the content creators for the work they are doing. And not just immediate reward but a cascading one. So if some developers/marketing/adoptors use the channel to come and join the cardano community and be part of the network expansion, these content creator should also benefit in some way via ADA.\n\n  \n\nTHAT IS THE LARGER QUESTION WE SHOULD ADDRESS INSTEAD OF BEING FOCUSSED ON NARROW GAINS/LOSSES",

These other shows have found success on their own merit, and they didn't wait for a community fund to dip their fingers into to get started. If a show has good content, it finds viewers, if it finds viewers the quality of the channel and content naturally improves with time.\n\nI get that a lot of people on here are \"friends\" with some of the people submitting these ideas and want to support them, but by doing so you're not really adding as much value to the ecosystem as you would be by giving that money to someone who is actually building on Cardano.\n\nCharles' word is not law, and just because he wants there to be more shows about Cardano, doesn't mean there aren't significantly better ways to spend that money that will achieve far more than another youtube channel or discussion video. If he wants more shows he can create his own personal ideascale project and fund it out of his own pocket and leave treasury funds alone.\n\nIf you want to pay someone to talk about Cardano be my guest, but it is without a doubt a waste/misappropriation of community funds when there are a lot of shows finding success without our money.",

Not that KYC is a problem for many of them, although some do have credible ID issues.\n\nBasically what's needed in the Philippines is a place they can go to and show some id or give a secret number and grab the cash to gitsum food.

    "Comment": "\"I hope this info will help you to reach more audience for your Podcast\"\n\nHow to Sell Anything to the Masses?\n\nThe less you seem to be selling something- the better...make your approach soft, seductive, and insidious.\n\nSOFT: be indirect...Create news and events for the media to pick up, spreading your name in a way that seems spontaneous, not hard or calculated.\n\nSEDUCTIVE: keep it entertaining...Your name and image are bathed in positive associations; you are selling pleasure and promise.\n\nINSIDIOUS: aim at the unconscious, using images that linger in the mind, placing your message in the visuals...\n\n...Appear as news, never as publicity...People pay more attention to what is broadcast as news- it seems more real. You suddenly stand out from everything else, if only for a moment- but that moment has more credibility than hours of advertising time. The key is to orchestrate the details thoroughly, creating a story with dramatic impact and movement, tension and resolution...\n\nAim for the heart, not the head. Design your words and images to stir basic emotions. Similarly, find ways to surround yourself with emotional magnets- well known people...Pay more attention to the form of your message than to the content. Images are more seductive than words, and visuals- soothing colors, appropriate backdrop, the suggestion of speed or movement- should actually be your real message. The audience may focus superficially on the content, but they are really absorbing the visuals, which get under their skin and stay there longer than any words.They should make people feel happy or sad...Remember: images linger in the mind long after words are forgotten. The key is learning to express your message through visuals that insinuate positive emotions and happy feelings...\n\n... people want to be entertained, they suspend their disbelief for a while and imagine that the magic is real...The public has a weakness for what seems both realistic and slightly fantastical- for real events with a cinematic edge... Make your events and publicity stunts plausible and somewhat realistic, but make their colors a little brighter than usual, the characters larger than life, the drama higher. You are creating a confluence of real life and fiction- the essence of any seduction.",

A lot of good points shared.  \n  \nI think we are all looking at this from different angles, and some the same.  \n  \nWhat I am trying to do with the real estate business(LLC) and blockchain tech is focused around building a holding company that owns and develops real estate. And offers anyone in the world to invest with us by ether being a lender or asset holder or both with as little as $10(fiat or crypto).  \n  \nI will probably launch this on ETH in the next 3 weeks. And then when it is possible use the ERC20 Converter to migrate to ADA :D  \n  \nFor the early stages of this, the LLC will probably only invest in the USA and focus on my region to start. It is not hard to buy property in most places as a business. And to start we are not trying to move the transaction process onto the blockchain. All I want to do at this point is make it easy for people to invest in real estate easily, securely, and successfully as possible by the Tokenization of assets and loans.",

Auditability - What details are missing about the proposers, the plan and/or usage of funds to help reviewers accurately assess this proposal? : Our Virtual Incubator program will test and build ideas with Plutus and Marlowe in an open-source online environment. Our experiential Podcast Series will help developers and entrepreneurs build Dapps and businesses on Cardano while others watch and learn along with us. Like Bob Ross would say \"We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents\" is our motto, and what we learn from testing startup hypothesis and customer development experiments we will share with others to learn from too. We will use some of the funding/grant received to create bounties and giveaways for viewers of the workshop. People watching will get real knowledge and cool opportunities from being involved with our episodes. \\\\\\\\------- Steve Aldrich ------ Removed my experimental edit Do you have access to more developers to do training videos? Could IOG, or CF be tapped for access to these additional resources. \\\\\\\\------------------------------- Last Edited by Steven Aldrich 23/Aug/20 7:47 AM \\\\\\[Show Revision History\\\\\\] 2\\\\.  \n\nImpact - How do you think this proposal can better address the challenge: How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months? : Our workshops are reaching and bringing in Haskell developers that have no experience with Plutus and Marlowe and having them learn it building something for entrepreneurs who want to start businesses on Cardano. Our workshops pay Haskell developers to learn Plutus and Marlowe and what is being paid to the DEVS is being invested in building Dapps for entrepreneurs who are dreaming about starting businesses. At ADA MakerSpace Haskell DEVs will get hands on paid learning experiences and entrepreneurs will get Dapps built that they may have not been able to fund or created themselves. ADA MakerSpace will be free to watch and lucky entrepreneurs who are tuning-in and completing bounties can get their ideas built by ADA MarkerSpace. And those that can afford development can sponsor an episode/s creating funding for the podcast and incubation of ideas built on Cardano. Last Edited by You 18/Aug/20 2:45 PM 3\\\\.  \n\nFeasibility - What are ways in which this proposal's budget, plan, scope or team can be modified to make it more likely for the proposal to be successfully implemented? : The proposal is already pretty successfully implemented. With the MVP website and the first lesson already scheduled and funded this proposal is a Proof of Concept already it just needs support from Cardano, Emurgo, and IOHK. But if it relies on the Team members to put in all the time, money, and energy to launch and maintain it until fund2 funding is given out, then its reach and impact will be limited. And all stakeholders in ADA will be missing a huge opportunity. It will cost $2400 to pay DEVs to learn and teach 8 episodes, and a few hundred in operating cost for the 2 months for the Team to support this themselves without making anything. But then the team would have to be stressed out about investing effort into creating a high-quality podcast and promoting it while having to spend time making money for living expenses by putting the most effort into something else that probably not helping Cardano get more DEVS and Entrepreneurs into the ecosystem.

    "Comment": "Update to everyone: After several informal discussions on twitter related to the Reach platform building a DSL for streamlining Plutus dApp process I sent the entire team an email cc'ing @dor.garbash  to see if we can help this group get a proposal submitted and secure funding to get started on this work. \"The Reach programming language is a high-level DApp language that outputs the entire dApp, not just the smart contract\". The team has already deployed on Ethereum + Algorand and looking at their Github repo (~70% in Haskell) this team loves Plutus/Marlowe they just dont know it yet :wink:\n\nI also highlighted the active Cardano Foundation RFP calling for additional smart contract languages on Cardano. It seems Reach would be an ideal candidate for funding here as well. Depending on how much they are able tor receive from CF I would be happy to help this team put together a sound proposal for Treasury funding (similar to work I am completing with Jeronimo for Shopify integration). This team has \\*both\\* the quality previous experience and are genuine Haskellers to the core, match made in heaven imho.\n\nLink to Reach Twitter + Github documentation: https://twitter.com/reachlang\n\nhttps://reach-sh.github.io/reach-lang/index.html",

All you would do is record a bunch of lessons where you are filming a Dev (ideally their computer screen's IDE) as they go through steps for installing Plutus/smart contract offchain tooling, developing smart contracts, static analysis, etc. Walk them through the entire process soup to nuts so when they complete they can even receive some \"Plutus Training certified badge\" (potentially could allow them to even port their training certificate into Atala Prism so now when we talk about building Developer Hubs/Marketplaces/Training centers @cryptotexty  @shapiro21  @jaycidiq  we have a clear structure/format for new devs to follow. 1. Take this course and show us all you understand the Plutus platform by completing/passing any end of training questions (maybe instead of questions/exam they have to build a few smart contracts and deploy to MN this would be cool and more sticky imho). 2. Start completing dev bounties and earning ada for your time/efforts. This seems very straightforward and sticky when it comes to bootstrapping dev adoption.",

    "Comment": "@liqwid.labs  The logic has to do with how all of the competitors work. For example, UpWork is the biggest competitor and it uses the legacy fiat system to move the money from the entrepreneur to the free-lancer. In addition, they store everything on the server. Imagine what the regulatory costs and requirements are for using the fiat system: the needed man power, the fees, etc. This has to be a huge expense. If Cardano was used as the payment channel instead, that expense simply wouldn't exist. And by storing what we can on the blockchain, we also don't need that much server space. These are arguably the biggest expenses that a platfom like UpWork would have. (I am including the necessary man power to maintain the fiat system and servers in this statement).  \n\nI totally agree with the bounty program. That could be a good jump starter for adoption. It might be more realistic for the Fund2 to fund something like your idea and I would get funding for the marketplace from the other funds available. My idea would basically require the entire pot. In the end, I think the marketplace will have a bigger impact, but not in 6 months.",

I would like the Staked Rewards of the money that is held to be distributed to the winning projects to fund the back office contributors that will help the submitter s to improve their proposals and filter out the scammers\n\nLack of women in the industry is very bad as technology will continue to move towards men and having the balance of woman is necessary. Not meaning to promote my other project (but am aware I am) https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/FOX-Rewards/316039-48088 the interface and appeal of my project needs to appeal to both men and women and needs input from both to be successful.\n\nDuring your courses your students would have an end goal to aim for where they would be able to pitch their ideas for funding. They could be certified and placed in a different category to encourage entrants to follow a desired path to show they are serious about starting a project.",

I am curious mate you say \"The marketplace could be very profitable since its competitors are all charging (about) 20% fees. Using blockchain, the marketplace could charge 5-8% and use the profits for doing what you are proposing.\" Not really sure who you mean here by the competitors could you flesh out this logic/math bro?\n\n  \n\nTo you second paragraph: Okay so the way I envision integrating this into a Dev marketplace would be with a bounty attached for successfully bringing a product to MN in a given timeline meeting specific KPI's/metrics. Profitability of the Dev Marketplace matters much less imho when you are directly attaching economic incentives to these product requests. I also see this as a massive way to bootstrap Cardano dev ecosystems globally not just on the marketplace/Cardano Dev Hub. Ideas like @jaycidiq  to setup a Cardano Dev Training Center would massively benefit from having developer product bounties attached to specific defi products we want introduced to the community. This is basically how defi focused hackothons in ethereum work today, the EF/Consensys selects a specific product category and all devs compete for funds building MVP's over a 2-3 day period. My plan involves combining these hackothns with a more med-long term dev bounty program.",

    "Comment": "@liqwid.labs  :) thank you as always for the questions and feedback! They are helping me with my go-to-market messaging.  \n  \nI don't know if you viewed the attached WTIM Smart AD Contract PDF, PDF attachments get kinda lost and overlooked in ideascapes layout. But the incentives for a business to spend advertising dollars on a WeThinkItMatters Campaign are multiple.\n\n1\\. Advertisers get 3 times more impressions from a CPA (Cost Per Action) than they get on any other media in the industry, and for a lower CPA cost than the industry standard. So it cost less and provides 3x times the engagement compared to anything on the market.\n\n2\\. Advertisers get guaranteed that 60% of whatever they spend will be benefiting charities and making a positive impact in our global communities. So they could spend $1 with our competitors and have $0 do anything good for their employees and customers, or they could spend $1 with WTIM and know $.60 went to make a difference.\n\n3\\. Advertisers get guaranteed that 10% of whatever they spend will go those they are engaging with. So if they advertise with our competitors(all but a few) and spend $1 most of the time $0 is going to the person they are advertising to. With WTIM $.10 of every $1 spent on WTIM goes to lotteries Voting Members can win.\n\nAs for the $10k beta sold two years ago. It was built by a self-taught wanna be developer and was mostly smoke and mirrors with no real backend functionality. Also, there was no onboarding tools to help the advertiser and partnering nonprofits understand how to get the most from the campaign. It was like I build them a drill and they tried using it to pound in nails.",

    "Comment": "@m  I could get it going with $250k. I could make it last 2-3 years which should be enough time to get enough revenue going that I could fund the excess myself. Using blockchain to do the heavy lifting makes the operational costs dirt cheap when compared to other platforms that do similar things. For example, UpWork is the biggest competitor and it needs to take a 20% fee to stay profitable. With blockchain, I could possibly go as low as 5%. Once the Marketplace establishes its reputation, all of those developers on UpWork (there are millions) would flock to the Marketplace simply because it doesn't take so much from them. It is also easier to pay people around the globe with ADA than with fiat. This would allow it to be truly global unlike UpWork and the others like it. We could do marketing to encourage the developer migration when the time is right (it has to be easy to by and sell ADA).  \n\nI know it is the entire pot but this is the only project I have seen that has the potential to be profitable enough to fund other projects in the space. In other words, it is the only one that can potentially open up another significant funding source in addition to driving adoption. Another source would be a huge boost to Cardano.  \n\nI could be wrong about the potential of The Developer Marketplace but that is why I recently posted my entire thought process for the community to audit. I would really like to fund other projects from the profits of this potentially global platform.",

    "Comment": "@eysteinh  Great points here!\n\nAgreed, we need easier access to published research. In the US, taxpayer-funded research (national labs and government-funded research in general, which is most of it) is open in principle but one has to play trick to find the information. It is usually posted in not-easy-to-find repositories. Having an AI platform to search through these repositories and organizes the information in an easily searchable way would be another great spin-off of this project. Here's an example of one such source of publications from the US: https://www.osti.gov/search-tools . This is not just for publications, but also for patents, code, etc, funded by the US government.\n\nSo, easier access to information is one of the problems. The second one is the jargon used, many people would not understand what the authors want to say because it is written in a jargon that a very small community can understand, and not necessarily the people that have the problem to be solved. It all goes back to communication and building the bridges so that what is written in those articles could be translated to the people for which that research is useful. One of the things the Dscience to Dtech platform could do is to link all the relevant players and facilitate the communication between them to lead to useful outcomes. It is possible that AI could help here in the communication and translating jargon, which is also worth exploring.",

This leads to progress. However, in addition to that, I truly believe we are missing out on much bigger things. There is a lot of research around the world (in fact most research) that is never considered because it does not address an immediate specific problem, or because it is written in a way (overly technical jargon) that people who may use it simply does not understand it. Both approaches are valid, and we can build the platform to address both:\n\n1\\. Identify cool published science that will lead to new cool technology\n\n2\\. Identify important problems and look for the published science that can help solve them.",

If it grows into something more or you want to develop it on another domain that is fine. But if you are open to it this is how we could build out these ideas/proposals together and concentrate the effort of driving traffic to one place. Charles just put up $15k + $15k Show Bounty and I would like to work with you to turn your proposal into a Livestream learning podcast. Please let me know your thoughts, thank you!",

    "Comment": "@cryptotexty  I did say with open borders. In any case it's a poor choice of word, really just to contrast with a \"democratised\" pool. I think centralised vs decentralised pool governance is a better way to say it. I'm working on a better write-up of the idea. Will be looking to update it before the 19th initial draft cut off.\n\nNo Most pools don't currently need it, but I think that will change. This would always be an opt in system, if a pool operator/owner/s don't want to open up any direct control to stakers they wouldn't have to.\n\nI do plan to offer my pool as a test case, along with another few. If stakers join them then it will be a clear signal that stakers want to try this. Just getting it all ready to go, and looking for any input, refinement.\n\nYes there is a lot of internal interest within my pool already to get involved. I am a pool maintained by 1 person, the idea enables me to get help and draw on skills of stakers from within the pool. I will be sharing some of the pool tax collected with these stakers that get involved creating internal pool ADA paid jobs.\n\nThanks for the feedback Andrii cheers.",

This makes the operating cost a fraction of what it would be otherwise. And since Cardano is the most scalable blockchain, any platform like this on another blockchain would lose to this one in the end. So it may not be that my platform is unique in what it does, it just has a superior business model since it uses blockchain. The ADA being used as the default currency also makes it significantly easier to pay people around the globe. I don't know of a single platform that can do this too.

Maybe even just a place for right now that what you are talking about could happen right now while waiting for the next version of an MVP.\n\nI think you are right about the next MVP being on a domain name and since you are tight on funds now I just went and purchased thedevelopermarketplace.com after the mandatory waiting period for new domain purchases I will transfer ownership to you. Until then I will review your proposal again in more detail and get some of the concepts built on the domain purchased so we can begin trying to attract DEVs. The website does have to be on the blockchain to be a POC. Just getting people to create a profile proves interest in using the platform. In lean startup, this is a customer development experiment to test the idea Haskell devs would want something like this. I believe some do, but let's validate that hypothesis by getting them to register on a website. I will do my best to have something for you to look asap!",

However, there is also a large number who would rather work remotely and are only working for big companies because it is steady pay. It is way easier than trying to find new free-lance work repeatedly. And your fee comment about Upwork is exactly why this platform is needed. This business model can easily under-sell all of those other platforms due to the cheap operating costs of using blockchain. This platform can under-sell the others by a wide margin. Right now, it is a relatively niche market, but the future is tending towards remote free-lance work. We just need to make finding the work at an affordable fee, easier.

In this scenario, let us say the 20 whales vote \"yes\" and everyone else votes \"no.\"  \n\nIn the vote based on capital, the whales dominate and their yes's make up 80% of the vote. So in the capital vote, the yes's win.\n\nIn the vote based on population, 80% voted no and so the no's win.  \n\nExact same vote, two different outcomes simply due to the different weights.

    "Comment": "P.S. @workshopmaybe  @eysteinh  @icoresearchgroup  @liqwid.labs  @cryptotexty \n\nWTIM is a Voting platform, so if Governance is a focus of Project Catalyst, then what better way to learn more about it by creating a Dapp that rewards Voters and improves their communities through a Vote.\n\nWTIM doesn't need a blockchain to be successful. Actually I have had experts and Devs tell me that I should consider not having blockchain be part of our platform because it will make the time and cost to build will be more. And that it could limit adoption of WTIM because if people have to use some special wallet or something to engage in the campaigns, that most people in the world don't use those things and thus not going to take part in a WeThinkItMatters campaign if the blockchain makes it harder for them.\n\nOn the topic of BAT and Brave browser. In some ways sure they are innovative, but WTIM and BAT are two different things. Brave is a tool for browsing the web, you could visit a WeThinkItMatters Campaign using Brave. Brave shows ADs to users that Advertisers have paid for, those ADs are to sell you something or almost always about getting your money somehow. When you click on an AD from Brave you get some BAT which represents a portion of what the Advertiser spent on the Cost Per Click (CPC). Brave is making the most money and none of the money the Advertiser spent is improving anything in the world. These are just the same ADs will already have but now Brave is getting a portion of the AD spend each year and throwing some pennies out for the masses in exchange for their attention.\n\nWeThinkItMatters is a new paradigm on advertising and what KIND of value and ROI it delivers. There is a secret in the marketplace that businesses haven't told you, and that secret is you are valuable! Everywhere you look today businesses are trying to get your attention and money. Your attention is valuable, and with WTIM you get more from it.\n\nWhat if I told you there are more than five hundred billion dollars a year being spent to influence you, but with WTIM you have the opportunity to influence it. Instead of businesses using advertising to try and influence what we want, now with WeThinkItMatters we can use advertising as a sustainable funding source for causes impacting all of us.\n\nThere is a special feeling you get from doing something for someone else, and that goes for both parties. Well, your probably not a billionaire or even a millionaire, but what if I told you could make an impact like you were. If you wish to make a difference in the world, WeThinkItMatters gives you the opportunity to have a positive impact with a Vote.\n\nBusinesses have been trying to get our attention and spending huge amounts to do it, and now with WeThinkItMatters we can tell them what to pay attention to. WeThinkItMatters offers you the ability to have a Vote in how some of the five hundred billion dollars spent on advertising each year is used.\n\nWeThinkItMatters gives you the opportunity to make a positive impact in the world with just a click of your finger, no donation required.

Cybil attacks. There won't be a problem for some oligarch to create lots of identities (which might be even not fake) and give then 100 ADAs to acquire the necessary amount of votes.\n\n2\\. I think 1 ADA = 1 vote is a simple and fair vote approach. It is real \"Skin in the game\", it's not equality, but of course equality doesn't exist in life. Early Cardano adopters and investors will have bigger power, but that's it.\n\nBtw, at the moment my ADA holding as very small (and will remain so for some time), so I won't be influential in voting by stake, but I can say my opinion of forum, reddit and maybe some big holder will agree to it.

    "Comment": "Hey shapiro, the ultimate goal of this is very similar to the one i'm proposing on \"Dream Weaver\", curious to see what you think of it. I'm looking for somebody to \"own\" that project as I don't have the time required, but I could help as a consultant. I think the primary difference from our proposals are a few things:  \n  \n1-Structure and Framework for what needs to be solved:  \nInstead of allowing people to simply create a \"post\" on what's needed, we first \"walk\" then thru a process that requires them to buld a \"framework\" of the current environment that they work on, this frame work would include things like, indusry, departments, services, roles, systems being used by departments and roles, etc... By creating this framework, we can do a few things: A- We give potential solution providers with a lot more concise information on what type of need they have and the 'environment\" that clietn works on, so the \"problem\" is more accurate and easy to understand.  \nB-It provides a foundation for others in similar fields to continue building on that framework, C-The \"crowd\" can validate the framework and the problem, making it more accurate and ellaborate as time progresses  \n  \n2-We would pay industry professionals to buiild the framework, the problems and the solutions, so initially, everyone would get paid (with funds from IOHK)\n\n  \n\n3-We would leverage Machine Learning so as time progresses, the platform could leverage all data to quickly and easily provide a set of recommendations to users, plus those teams of consultants that would help them execute that idea (See last page on document \"Par B\" or \"Dream Weaver\" proposal I posted).  \n  \nCurious to know your thoughts.",

    "Comment": "I think this could have great potential, different then the conventional educational approach of obtaining a certification; however, on the quality of the \"packets\" that are created as well as the demographics that these packets reach, age, income, education which will have an effect on the overall interest. The other thing to consider is the amount of resources that this might cost compared to the benefits and engagement that it will yield.  \nBut overall I think it's a great idea to test and pilot, specially on younger demographics. I also think the learning experience and results could be transferred over to a project like the one I proposed (Dream Weaver), which is basically a data repository of everything that relates to business value that is created on top of Cardano. Once the frame work is designed along with the solutions, it can be easily replicated across regions or industries.",

More than 1000 pools are already, while some of them might look similar, others are very different, and teams behind them are also very different. Moreover if somebody is not happy, it's very fast and easy to restake to another pool or even sell ADA completely.\n\nMany pools just don't need governance (especially pools run by 1 person), those who need - they can go ahead, I think you start experimenting with your pool. Or even you can tokenize it on Cardano blockchain when this becomes possible.\n\nAnd some of your other ideas might fit Project Catalyst like a separate projects.",

    "Comment": "@icoresearchgroup  I really appreciate you looking over my project and as the project plan is laid out at the moment I can see how it's hard to vision it being a killer app for Cardano.\n\nHaving zero notice about being accepted to the Project Cataylst melting pot and only part-way through building my application I can see how it looks like the project needs more \"fleshing out\", but I can guarantee the thoughts and plans behind the project given the right amount of backing in terms of finance and partnership support would have a huge return on investment for the Cardano brand.\n\nLet me explain my thoughts which should ultimately result in me being able to improve the proposition for the next stage in this experiment.\n\nThe fact the fitness, health and mindfulness space is growing is not negative, this shows there is an amazing growing opportunity for the right project to be successful. Good problems are popular for a reason but that should never stop innovation.\n\nMental health is one of the fastest growing spaces in the health industry and awareness has never been so strong however the underfunded and under-researched industry is at a critical junction.\n\nWellbeing effects everyone in their lifetime and there is a real urgent need to research and understand how people's mental state affects their lives, jobs and family's.\n\nThe current software applications concentrate on one element of people's lives whether its fitness, mental health or mindfulness. In truth we are all driven by different needs throughout and life and throughout the day. A fitness fanatic one day with Bi-polar can be crippled another day and there daily goal is not to walk an extra 1km its just to get out of bed and make it through the day.\n\nMy project will adapt to the day-to-day struggles and highs gently suggesting self-help where it can and helping general fitness when appropriate. Fitness is proved to be a great help in the fight to help mental health but if the person cannot even face the postman how are they going to get the motivation to run a mile?\n\nLots of mental health issues are hidden and self-help is an amazing way to reach out.\n\nThe mixture of the 3 datasets will also provide fascinating scientific data in what techniques can help and how peoples need for help changes throughout their life/days.\n\nThe app will be used multiple times a day and should quickly spread through many forms such as fitness and medical hubs.\n\nFor those lucky people with no mental health issues, the introduction to meditation and fitness goals could enrich their lives even more.\n\nWhy will this create value for Cardano? That's a simple one.\n\nI have followed Cardano since 2017 and believe the mathematical and scientifically approach shares the same values and fundamentals as myself and what I want my project to build upon. I want to associate my product with the Cardano brand and believe they in turn will want to associate with product and my brand for the same reasons.\n\nI am looking for a long term disruptive partner that can understand my vision and believe Cardano is the right company and block chain to build upon\n\nI don't want a successful business built upon Ethereum for example that could fail in a few years because the block chain foundations it was built upon crumble taking me down with it. Ethereum and others are quick to the market and this will be shown that they are playing catch-up with Cardano - I can't wait or take the chance on a project that is running 1000 miles down the track to try and change their engine mid race.\n\nI believe my project can be 10x better than the competition and it doesn't faze me to start from behind, I can build on their wins and mistakes and use it to my advantage.\n\nThe decentralised and community led element of a lot of my eco-system will help the project grow and at every possible step I will be shining the light of Cardano who helped grow and continues to support the project that I hope ultimately will change people's lives forever and give them some hope and release from the crippling disease that is mental health.",

    "Comment": "@robgreig  I wanted clarify something here. The risk of centralization isn't that of one single entity or a group of entities taking over the network. Rather, my concern is that current incentive schemes, when optimized against two performance dimensions (fees, uptime), would inevitably move the entire network into the cheapest cloud infrastructure.\n\nImagine a substantial number of different Cardano pool operators all hosting their nodes with a handful of companies (to stay competitive on costs).\n\nThat may not be an apparent risk, but it does pose structural single-point-of-failure risks (e.g. what if these companies ban staking operations? what if their network suffers an attack?).  \n\nFor the network to sustain a diversified topology, it needs to have a way to offer something in addition to rewards. Introducing a platform where all these added dimensions of pool performance live, along with avenues that facilitate interaction between SPOs and their stakeholders, will ultimately diversify offerings and attract a wider audience of delegators who would keep Cardano decentralized.",

    "Comment": "Thank you for posting this idea @juliane  it really resonates with me. Ideas with the biggest potential are often the messiest and most vulnerable, and establishing safe ways to work toward making them viable will go a long way toward real innovation. Establishing trust and community through competency matching has the potential to resonate far beyond this initial Catalyst experiment.\n\nIn defining any system of governance, of course we have to pay attention to the technical details of how things must work; these details can be codified in rules and laws. Equally important are the unwritten \"norms\" in a system, and your proposal makes me think about those. Although it's hard to create legislation that makes space for vulnerable ideas to take root, the norms we set now for how ideas are shared and nurtured will help to signal what kind of space this becomes. Again, messy work.\n\nFor me, the good news is that IOG has been leading by example for years, choosing the methodical and rigorous approach to building a robust system, even though that has brought some criticism about moving slowly. How can we ensure that the incubation of ideas across the Cardano ecosystem carries that torch?",

IGP Tokens would represent a stake in all the real estate Investment Group Properties LLC owns, not individual properties. So Token holders risk would be lower since they would not be betting on one property.  \n\nTo start we will primarily only do fix&flip and land development and sell for profit. We would do owner financing(hold the note) on properties down the road when IGP had enough reserves.\n\nOr we could have two Tokens from the start, one that invested in fix&flips and one that invested in buy and seller finance. And people could buy one or the other or both and diversify that way.\n\nOpen to ideas and feedback and would love to chat more. Maybe you, @robgreig  and me could all connect this week?",

In September I will be approaching businesses again with a new version of the platform in development now.\n\n\"Also have you tried to implement your solution on a public blockchain to date (I know you mentioned ethereum block space/gas fees as a nonstarter but have you tried any others?)\" in the past I launched the WTIM Token on TRON https://tronscan.org/#/token/1002588 and was going to build there. But on watching the crypto space and sentiment towards TRON decided to not move forward there. The new version of WTIM coming out in Sept is not using any blockchain but may incorporate Hyperledger soon.\n\n\"Last question: Have you looked into Basic Attention Token?\" oh yeah, and ADbank, and BIGBOM, and others. But none of them are doing anything like WTIM. As a matter of fact you could use the Brave browser to engage with a WeThinkItMatters campaign, you can use any device in the world that has an internet browser to engage on WTIM. BAT you can only get when you are using Brave and all the rest of the AD revenue is doing nothing to improve the world.

On the one side, your vote would carry the weight relative to the ADA you are holding behind it. On the other side it would carry the vote as you the individual.\n\nTheoretically, and this is all open for discussion/change, funding requests would need to pass both houses in order to move forward. This would mean that if the big whales wanted something to go through, they would still have to convince a MAJORITY stakeholders for it to happen. it also means that just because a majority of stakeholders are convinced or think something should move through, the people who actually have the largest to gain and lose by those proposals must also be in agreement.",

Mail in balloting has to be the most flawed idea I have ever seen in my life as a proud American. It will be such a mess and SO easy to vote multiple times. Our registration process is easier to sign up for than creating a gmail account. With no in person voting, people can enjoy from their homes voting as many times as they want. I can stand in line everywhere right now, in the store, at the restaurant; literally everywhere yet I can't stand in line to vote at the polls? Think about that for a minute and how much sense that doesn't make.  \n  \nTHIS is the reason voting needs to be on the blockchain. I'm not talking governance voting for/within the system, now I'm speaking of voting for political office. In the US, it's very easy. You're 18 or older, you are a US Citizen, you have one living address or address of residence, and you get ONE vote. Case closed. This would be easy to acheive with DID and the blockchain.\n\nSo if we want fair elections on chain not just for Cardano, we completely are in agreement that DID and Cardano could make that happen.",

TDLR: 1 Ticket = 1 ADA, all of the ADA is staked/put into liquitidy pools to earn trading fees on a money market (In Ethereum I am pretty sure they take dai and put it in Compound liquidity pools). At the end of each week a VRF (verifiable random function) selects a ticket from the pool and they win all of the stake/interest accrued from fees. No loss lotteries like this can actually incentive saving and in a way it's like you are creating a positive sum game.

In the same breath how can we encourage devs to build public facing voting systems that utilize Atala Prism? To me that's where the real Bicameralism voting mechanism magic comes into play. Take U.S. for example we are in a situation where the President is holding the Postal Service hostage in a clear attempt of voter suppression for the upcoming election. The GOP can immediately shoot down any request to do eVoting because \"the Dems will game it\". We all know the advent of blockchain and more specifically ID products like Prism makes this argument completely moot and we are already seeing early implementations in public voting: https://cointelegraph.com/news/indias-citizens-will-vote-with-blockchain-election-commissioner-says.

I really liked this part and think it gets to the essence of what Cardano is all about: \"This project will establish a dynamic presence in a financially challenged region and use a feedback loop of education, awareness creation, problem identification, and blockchain technology to ultimately boost quality of life of local populations\"\n\nWe need to ensure that blockchain education, problem/inefficiency identification (many times this is the base of innovation), funding, and general awareness on Cardano powered solutions are a key focus for West African nations. What does this mean in action? It means education material being produced for developing financial products in Marlowe/general purpose applications on Plutus are sponsored in African universities for finance/business students to innovate. It means we need to scale up the IOHK Africa team (specifically in Ghana and Nigeria and other West African nations). These are certainly just a few but I am a firm believer that if we put this technology in the hands of builders (backed with the education and funding) they will seek out the inefficiencies in their local communities and build solutions to solve them.",

    "Comment": "Hey mate this is a great idea (and one I went deep down the rabbit hole with for a few days earlier this year lol I was going to name it \"Unstoppable Realty\"). I consulted my dad (25 years in Real Estate) and the actual incentives for the homeowner are not that sticky (not only are they not receiving full or even guarantee of full payment, they're selling a home slowly overtime that they can no longer live in as investors will expect rent cash-flows). The incentives for a foreign investor to gain exposure to Real Estate in US/UK/Europe are clearly very sticky and we already see a large amount of Chinese family offices do this in places like NYC today. This app idea also exists already on Ethereum its called RealT. Here is there site: https://realt.co/. I encourage you to read through their whitepaper (they have essentially tokenized a series company which is the sole owner of the land deed). Interesting way to jump through the regulatory hoops. Would love to chat more if you see more legs here but I feel incentives alignment (specifically 1. homeseller--2. platform--3. investor) are key here and in that order. Why is selling my home on this platform better than listing it on Zillow (U.S. online real estate app): https://www.zillow.com/. The platform on Cardano needs to be 10x easier, 10x less tx fees than the Zillow solution and be able to sell at the same price (if not more) than you could sell for on Zillow.",

    "Comment": "A political party is really nothing more than someone identifying with a set of beliefs or principles. Due to the limits of the brain's processing power, in order to function, we have to simplify complex situations and institutions into a few simple belief shor principles. For this reason, I agree with @shapiro21  that some iteration of political party or group could naturally arise in the process at some point. This can be seen when crytocurrencies split based on fundamental principles, ex Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\nPerhaps I'm being a little too idealistic here, but maybe there is a chance here for us to create a platform that enables people to extend beyond a few monolithic groups of ideas. Perhaps the system could be built in such a way that it would encourage individuals to expand their understanding of certain stereotypes and be given additional tools in the voting process to do research into a topic and be regularly invited to explore other perspectives, thereby reducing the tendency to clump ideas together into something like a political party.  \n\nWhat excites me about Cardano is that it really sets the ground work for disrupting society as a whole. When answering these questions, I think that we need to continually ask how we can create systems to encourage transformation at a fundamental level.",

    "Comment": "I really like this idea mate! Also just brainstorming here but what if your idea integrated into @joselmocabral  healthcare data exchange/marketplace. You can create a system where insurers/providers actually pay users who have verifiable data to prove they completed certain Fitness exercises (steps per day taken from fitbit) etc. I am almost sure this already exists in a centralized fashion today where insurers pay users/deduct cost based on their level of \"proof of exercise/health\".I think integrating these two ideas opens up entire marketplaces. Imagine if each day your health care provider/insurer paid uou/deducted from your costs based on your daily \"proof of exercise/health\". Pretty cool. Your ability to align incentives with insurers/healthcare providers (personal healthcare data + ability to sell verifiable \"proof of exercise/health\") and their users is the key innovation here imho. Would love to ideate on this more in the future.",

    "Comment": "@adamint  Ages since I did contract law but in general I think the best is to use a dualistic approach where you have a smart contract that is also in compliance with legal standards of the countries involved. That would mean having identity as well. This way in case of disputes outside of the financial parts of the contract you could use the court systems for this. In Norway an example is how we adapt EU law into our system so we are in compliance even when we have our own national laws. Same would be with a smart contract with its own set of parameters for when it is valid or not but should also be in compliance with the national/transnational laws. I hope that somewhat answers the question and I suggest we do pilots with some simple type of contracts.\n\nIn the future I want to develop this much further as I have an idea on this with a legal DSL (https://forum.cardano.org/t/bitlaw-a-legal-system-with-a-dsl-for-cardano-governance/18887) but I think this is so far off yet that I do not believe this is realistic to put into a smart contract at this point unless massively accelerated with research efforts.

This is to experiment in a lower cost setting (not full treasury) with other voting methods to iterate as I mentioned some examples of above. While a top down approach is great and definitively needed I think also organic bottom up of governance is good as well. This is what would happened if we users of cardano ourself tried to experiment with other voting methods.

    "Comment": "@shapiro21  You lay out some great points here. To respond to @wunderbaer  does it matter if the dev \"steals\" the idea in the end? The smart contract/dApp will be deployed for free so the \"idea owner\" is in a complete win-win situation. Their idea is launched and it costed them 0. The developer on the other hand takes all risk by developing and implementing the dApp (which may or may not become a success). This is also much less of an issue if you attach a reputation system \\[built on top of Prism ;)\\] to this \"Idea meets Dev on Cardano\" application.\n\nWe can also give the \"idea owner\" the right to include additional mitigation (only describing a high level overview of their app idea, only give access to devs with prior reputations, demanding a signed NDA before further discussion/dev start). The NDA is the most comprehensive (real world legal implications).This is pretty common in consulting when two or more firms are coming together to pitch a client on a solution they will jointly develop.",

The one question that I have is does this mean that everyone would get two votes? I ask because, the bicameral system uses representatives to cast votes, so you can easily say that the members of one house cannot cast a vote in the other house. However, in the Cardano ecosystem, there are no representatives, only individual members, so that means that the same individual would have to cast a vote in both houses, right? If so, in principle, they would cast the same vote twice which would not actually play out to be a bicameral system, even if the two votes were weighted differently.",

Creating and maintaining authentic engagement will be necessary for the governance piece to be fully integrated into the life of the ecosystem. One of my concerns about the governance portion of the community is that not enough people will participate in it on a regular basis and that it, in turn, will only be left to a few motivated individuals. Focusing now on how to build up the desire for verified and authentic engagement will have a large impact on the initial and long-term success of the system.",

    "Comment": "Hey Boone, I read through your proposal and diagram links and checked out your website I think this is a super interesting idea (bundling advertisements with charities/causes for positive social change). That being said I also felt some of the mechanics behind your token's utility function were unclear (per @icoresearchgroup  comment above). For starters I would like to know how you think about the incentives behind organizations sponsoring WTIM campaigns? How many previous corporations have sponsored WTIM campaigns. Also have you tried to implement your solution on a public blockchain to date (I know you mentioned ethereum block space/gas fees as a nonstarter but have you tried any others?) Last question: Have you looked into Basic Attention Token? It seems you are going for similar issues in the ads space with your specific niche in sponsoring positive social campaigns, but I could be totally wrong here too\\*. Let me know what im missing/where I went wrong. This has legs and we need this on Cardano (and you can always decide to fork BAT code and integrate your unique WTIM ideas) https://basicattentiontoken.org/",

We intend to create an curate original training/e-learning contents/hands-on activities during this phase. We will eventually transition to using a digital library combined with real time physical/online lectures and peer to peer leaning. We are not really specializing as we will have general content on blockchain with special emphasis on Cardano. Our goals are beyond just a training center, it would also serve as a point to access open source content, incubation hub for startups,venue for cardano events/publicity. We will be actively creation solutions and solving the problems that communities across Africa are facing.\n\nInternet connectivity are not widespread in most parts of Nigerian hence reliance on USSD based services rather than smart phones and distance learning is still at it's infancy stage in fact schools only started looking into it since the emergence of this pandemic. Learning has been on hold since the advent of Covid-19 and in Nigeria only students in key classes have returned back to school. In summary, we're not fully equipped or ready for online e-learning especially due to the high cost of internet and related resources. This is not to say that we will not leverage on online learning, I'm just noting the limitations inherent within Africa.\n\nNo city has 24hrs electricity in Nigeria. Urban locations can provide good internet. We intend to buy/rent a good facility, we also intend to work with existing hubs in other locations in the country so as to increase our reach. In essence our model has one major hub in major cities in Africa.\n\nIn the long run we intend to own our infrastructure so as to reduce costs, it's a long term project we structured into phases and milestones so we can measure our successes and adapt in order to succeed across Africa.\n\nWe will definitely be open for partnerships within and outside the community.\n\nWe have team members with experience in setting up and running hubs within Nigeria.\n\nAs I stated earlier, the project is structured into phases and the funding requested is for our launch phase. yeah In the long run it will provide access to skilled manpower and reduce development costs of dapps on the cardano ecosystem.We see an opportunity to develop a gender inclusive programs for youths and proficient developers as well as provide them with the environment they need to make their ideas and projects a reality. We will explore and take advantage of the best strategy to make this vision a success.\n\nApologies for the late response :))",

    "Comment": "@boonetb  thanks for the comment. My understanding is that our current challenge Is to Develop a plan to attract developers via the catalyst program/process. This will inform the next cohort and so on until we have enough traction that catalyst is no longer needed.\n\nIf I'm correct, I have one simple question.\n\nWhen one is working toward attracting folks to develop on Cardano via catalyst, what do we have to say when asked how this works? Do we have a process defined? Do we have timelines? Do we have contracts to review with them?\n\nI get it, we could all just hit the streets shouting \"FUNDING HERE, Come and get it\". But without a process to actually onboard them, we are going to hit a wall..\n\nWho would expect anything of substance to happen outside of a well defined process?\n\n  \n\nMaybe you and I are speaking past one another here, where you think I understand you and visa-versa... Help me understand your real concern about how having a well defined process to attract builders toward. Help me understand how you think this would be a distraction from the task at hand.\n\nI'm listening...",

    "Comment": "Oh I thought the internet was more wide spread in Africa than that. Actually, one of my goals in life is to fund the infrastructure building like what you are talking about. The model that I have been considering is as follows:\n\n1\\. I would call it something more in line of a Digital Library rather than a training center. If I was walking by the venue and was just looking for an internet connection to do work, I would not consider a training center as a place to do work. If I name it a \"training center\", I will only attract people who think they need training. If I called it a \"digital library\", libraries are known for being places to both study and work. Maybe your culture is different but I hope you understand what I mean. It is better not to specialize in the early days and a \"training center\" implies specializing for students. I am sure there are already developers in African cities even if they are rare. I would want these people to come too.\n\n2\\. I would still strive for the udemy application. I haven't run the numbers but I think having one venue that can connect to the immense amount of resources already on the internet is far more efficient and cost effective than trying to create African specialized courses and schools. For example, Haskell is Haskell whether you are in London or Nigeria. There are already resources online for learning Haskell. If I can just tap into them, it would save me a lot of time and money.\n\n3\\. I would pick a city that has good internet and stable electricity. Buy or rent a large building there and make sure the internet can be reached in every part of the building. I would then divide the building into sections where a person or group of people can go and either work or study.\n\n4\\. I would plan on operating at a loss for 5-10 years. The people working in the building most likely won't be able to pay anything for using it. They probably just won't have the money. If I was running a stake pool, I would funnel as much of the profit as needed into paying for the building for those years.\n\n5\\. After a while, developers should have learned from the udemy or coursera courses already available and could then start looking for jobs. My Help Wanted platform would be perfect for them finding remote work. After working for a while, they would then be able to pay a very small fee for using the building. I want to emphasize the very; it shouldn't impact their budget at all otherwise they may stop coming. At this point, the building could be self-funding if not profitable.\n\n6\\. I would only do one building at a time, especially in the beginning because it is a risky venture. I would only consider creating another building somewhere else once the previous building is self-funding. I would target all the major cities in Africa for locations to build these digital libraries. I would only branch out from the cities once I have built these digital libraries in most cities and they are sustainable.\n\nThe fact that I could run a pool is actually a huge plus because it can continuously give me money to fund this. However, it will be very expensive because I have to front the money for several years. I don't know what the average cost of things in Africa is but it would probably be similar to owning a large building in a big city in Africa with electricity always running. I would need to be able to fund it for about 7 years. That is my starting point for a budget and it is always better to have extra. You would know better than me but I am skeptical that 655,000 ADA will be enough for this. It will probably be a decade long endeavor. I would have enough for the 7 years and plan on putting the majority of my stake pool profits toward it. If I need to live off the stake pool profits too, then I would have enough for the full 10 years just in case. I would also have room in my budget in case I need to supply the digital library with computers. If I have extra at the end, it is there for the next digital library.\n\nI actually think this is the best way for Africa to diversify its economy. Personally, I would not build a business with a physical presence in Africa. It would be too risky. However I would pay an African developer to make my company's website! Especially since the hourly wage could be sooo much less than if I hired a US or European developer. Africa just has to get developers online. It will start slowly but all things start slowly. India followed a similar plan by being IT departments for developed nations and that is now one of the largest sectors of India's economy. Africa can be the web designers or something like that.\n\nSorry for the long response. Feel free to not use any of this. I hope it at least gives you some ideas.",

I checked you proposal and definitely see the overlap with our projects.\n\nAs you know, Africa lives under conditions of a grossly underdeveloped economic, physical, educational, communication and other infrastructure. It has virtually no possibility to exercise what in reality amounts to a theoretical right to equal opportunity, with that right being equal within every 3rd world nation only to the extent that it is equally incapable of realization.\n\nMost of people and devs here don't have a private access to internet and infrastructure that is needed for learning or working in good conditions. The need for an AFRICAN DEVELOPER TRAINING CENTER cannot be over emphasized. We wanna provide them with the basics they need to learn and work professionally.\n\nMost African countries (even in Nigeria which is a \"privileged\" Country compare to some other within the continent) have inefﬁcient ICT-related infrastructure such as electricity,telecommunications, and computers. Therefore,the three pillars of the ICT revolution, that is, connectivity, capacity and content, are yet to be realized in Africa. We have start with what is feasible and obtainable right now.\n\nWe would definitely have the resources available on different relevant platforms like what you're proposing. This has been always in our plans but all ideas and help on how to set this up is more than welcome.",

    "Comment": "I think people should consider letting DID's be enough for the second house; no ADA requirement. Your DID would replace your social security number, or country equivalent. This is your entire identity which is what allows you to interact in the global economy, get loans, buy houses, rent apartments, etc. If Cardano collapses, you would lose the ability to do everything I just listed. You already have stake in the system just by having a DID. When you say whether someone \"has stake in it\" you are really asking \"do they care about it succeeding?\" If someone has a DID, the answer to this question is a definite yes. There is no need to link ADA to the DID to verify that they have stake in the system. It is redundant. Even if Cardano doesn't collapse, if your DID gets compromised it is the same as identity theft. I think that is enough of a threat to make people care.\n\nAnd this isn't something we need to wait for. Prism is being built for the countries that do not already have a social security number, or equivalent system. Everyone who will have a DID will care. Especially in those countries because it will dramatically improve the quality of their life.",

    "Comment": "I shared this on Telegram think it relates well to this proposal so reposting\n\nI was part of an experimental online accelerator program that gave out funding to run customer development experiments testing a hypothesis we had about our business ideas. The focus was key metrics you were measuring in the single objective experiment and brought awesome learning by testing the hypothesis with potential ideal clients. This whole program was run on trello and mentors(those who had done customer development experiments help new entrepreneurs through the process of creating a hypothesis to test and then submitting it for funding. I could see something very similar for proposal on ideascape. Imagine Ideascape is where proposals start, and when anyone wants to make a proposal for ADA funding the first submit on Ideascape and a group of mentors(like us to start) would work with those submitting to format their proposal correctly(while at the same time filtering spam) and once the proposal was formatted correctly it could be submitted for community Voting. This would help create high-quality ideas and proposals that went to the community and create a mentor driven incubator for proposal creation. And Cardano could pay bounties to mentors based on contribution to helping people creaft high-quality proposals. It turn the submission process into a center of innovation where mentors and future mentors were collaborating :diamonds:\n\nOne of the most important things in the process I mentioned was the key aspects of the hypothesis. And I think that is very much also key in Proposals. For example, key aspects of FUND proposals(not CIP) should be things like, Timeline and Milestones, Budget needs to be explained also clear as possible(this much is gong here, this much going here, etc.). And it might make sense to have funds awarded paid out based on the receiver reporting back to the proposal with results based on the timeline and milestones set. If they don't achieve something it doesn't no more of the funding, but they have share why it didn't happen. Those milestones and timeline could be tied directly to the cycles of the FUNDs(6-8 weeks). So I might be asking for $100k, but only requesting $50 at the start because I was going to use for this and that, and then in 6 weeks another $25k to continue paying team and services, and 6 weeks later the othe $25 after which I believe the business will be self-sustaining.

    "Comment": "@kungfucrypto  The science that I have seen in regards to voting on topics is that you actually don't need everyone to be an expert. You don't even need to know who the experts are. Imagine a voting situation where you can vote yes or no and there are 100 voters. Let us say 40 of them are experts and vote yes on the topic. The other 60 non-experts split their vote: half yes, half no. Then the votes are tallied. In this context, the non-experts canceled themselves out and you are left with the 40 yes votes from the experts. This vote is actually safe unless 51 of the 60 non-experts vote no. While possible, it is unlikely for that many non-experts to randomly agree.\n\nThe studies show you need a relatively large sample and diverse opinions. If you have these two conditions fulfilled, the extreme and un-informed decisions cancel themselves out. This has worked for samples around 100 voters so the sample doesn't need to be that large.\n\nObviously this isn't perfect because if the opinions polarize, the extreme and un-informed opinions don't cancel out. That is why precautions need to be taken to prevent this. Factors like geographic, cultural, socio-economical, etc should all be diverse. To further prevent polarization you can use a bicameral voting system like my House of ADA and Senate of Cardanians idea or the other bicameral idea that was posted. That is why most developed nations have bicameral governments.\n\nIOHK is actually testing this theory with us. We are the voters. Some people are more educated than others. Will the differing opinions cancel each other out and result in a favorable conclusion? I am curious to find out for myself. It needs to for Cardano's Voltaire to have any chance at all.

I understand the desire to give everyone a vote but I wonder if 80% of the poulation being able to vote is enough. As it is, voter turnout never reaches 100% of eligible voters.

If you use DID to board an airplane, no cost no need. If you use it to play on a social media platform, no cost.\n\nAgain, I do agree that most who have a DID will hold ADA but do we really think everybody is going to go to some exchange and buy ADA to have it?

I don't think you can build an analytical platform + data repository on a blockchain.\n\nIt is simply technically not possible, especially given the amount of data you'd need to house on the chain. I run a pool and I am in constant contact with IOHK scientists about the technical aspects of Cardano and I see technical centralization as something that we will eventually face if we do not act soon to reach lesser known pools who could produce a lot of value for the ecosystem but can't be captured with reward/performance metrics alone.",

    "Comment": "@boonetb  You're getting at something really important here, and it raises a key distinction.\n\nWe're going to need plenty of talented developers to build smart contracts - and let's support each other to become as well-versed in this as possible. I am excited about where my skills are headed, and still have room to grow. If you'd like to study together, I'm in.\n\nYour response is really helping me to clarify my idea - so let's see if this distinction makes sense.\n\nWith this proposal, I am not as much thinking about training people to build smart contracts. Instead, I am recognizing that plenty of smart contracts, once written, will be modular and re-usable, and there are many people out there with important skill sets that are separate from writing code. I want these people to be able to efficiently learn just enough about the Cardano platform, so that they can apply their talents where most needed.\n\nTake my somewhat trivial example of a t-shirt fundraiser from the proposal above. If we write a smart contract and a voting app implementation that allows (a) crowdfunding toward some cause with a t-shirt as gift swag, (b) artists to submit a design for what will appear on that swag, and (c) funders to vote on which design will appear on their swag, then I can imagine multiple people wanting to apply that \"package\" to their own ideas.\n\nThese people might be highly-engaged community members, influencers, artists, etc, whose time and talent are best applied to things other than writing great code from scratch. These are people who might (a) be committed experts to a cause in need of fundraising, (b) know a network of artists who would love to contribute designs to that cause, and (c) be able to motivate a network of people to support that cause, especially if they get some cool, community-designed swag. There are potentially thousands of people who might want to use a starter pack like this, and who would be willing to learn just enough about the smart contract to open it up and tweak some values. In turn, they'd now have that basic expertise in how the platform works, and their imaginations would be open to new possibilities. (Side note: outsiders with fresh perspective are often enough the ones who recognize an unexpected use of a new technology. All of us who have been deeply engaged in blockchain for years are probably missing the ideas right under our noses - waiting for a newcomer to light up the next killer app.)\n\nPerhaps a few would discern a calling to go much deeper into writing smart contracts for brand new use cases, but others would be satisfied that they were able to exhibit some ownership over the tech while still saving most of their time and talent for other things.",

    "Comment": "I like the idea but I think you can actually go bigger for cheaper than you think (without sacrificing quality). If you created a standardized Udemy course, you could have all of your students learn at their own pace. The professors will still be there (remotely) for support by answering forum questions and emails. Platforms like Udemy are making it so much easier for professors to teach with less effort. Instead of the professor having to actually teach the same course every year, the professor can create the video lectures and material once and just upload it to a platform like Udemy. Then students can access it anytime. You can charge a monthly fee for access or make it free. I believe this is where education is actually heading. This means it would be even easier to recruit professors to teach since they don't need to uproot their lives.\n\nIn addition this course could be open to everyone, not just African developers. If at the end of the course, you suggest areas to help Africa, you can make not only African developers aware of the issues but developers all over the world. Blockchain can be built remotely (but being physically there can help). I would personally use your Udemy course (and pay) and I am in the United States.\n\nI do think you should still have a venue for students to learn near one another. Studies show being around other students who are working dramatically encourages others to work hard. But you would only need to give them computers with an internet connection. This method could have a much larger impact for African developers at a fraction of the cost.  \n\nAs a final note, I think your idea maps well with mine called Developer Help Wanted - Platform. At the end of your course, you could have them all sign up on the Developer Help Wanted - Platform and they could potentially get jobs working remotely for entrepreneurs half-way around the world. That means more money flowing into Africa for further developments.  \n\nLet me know if you think this is feasible or not.",

In posting this idea, my goal is certainly to start a conversation and to see how this Catalyst community might refine it.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about how this idea would fit in alongside Emurgo Academy and IOHK Education. Both Emurgo Academy and IOHK Ed are the realm of genius (I don't use that term often, but it's warranted here), and both are essential to the existence of the platform on which we're building. By envisioning what mainstream adoption might entail, my goal is to make sure all of this genius work is accessible to the broadest possible community.\n\nWith this proposal, I seek to build upon the foundation built by IOHK and Emurgo by making this technology available to anyone with an idea, in particular anyone who might be more interested in running a small business in their community than understanding all the fundamentals of blockchain development. One thing I love about Plutus and Marlowe is that they're designed to be readable - even someone with limited experience with code can, with guidance and effort, be supported to understand the role of a smart contract and the parameters within it.\n\nWhile IOHK Education might provide the training to define a programming language in the first place, and Emurgo Academy might train someone to write robust smart contracts, one goal of this project is to support someone to read & understand an existing smart contract, and find the handful of lines where they can tweak a few values to fit their needs. The same applies to voting mechanisms: this project won't train someone in how to build a voting app, but it will provide hands-on experience in using one to support a local business.\n\nDoes that make sense?

    "Comment": "Why do you think it is necessary to have a minimum of 100 ADA per ID for a vote? I don't know about every voting system that has been tried on blockchains but I am pretty sure they have all been unicameral. I personally believe they failed for this very reason, not because it was 1 token = 1 vote. The founding fathers of the US were very adament to have bicameralism so that the two houses could balance each other. They feared one house would go un-checked and cause problems; the blockchain voting system seems to be proving this. Arguably, the US founding fathers got it right (anecdotal based on other countries copying them) and the only reason why the US gov. has been decaying over the past 50 years is because of the revolving door between Wallstreet and Congress. The representatives themselves are the weakest link. The House of Representatives was supposed to be the popular vote but bribes to these representatives have changed it from that. The House is no longer the opposite of the Senate and can no longer keep the system balanced. It is now all about money. I personally believe that this is the real problem plaguing the world.\n\nThe liquid democracy proposed by Cardano does not have the representatives and can therefore significantly mitigate the ability of bribes to influence politics. Because of this, I don't think it is necessary to force each ID to have 100 ADA. Prism is supposed to connect the ID to biometrics which I think will be enough. You can require fingerprint, facescan, and retinal scan (retinal possibly in the future). The more biometrics included, the harder it is to fake being a real person (or a different person.\n\nThe first house in your proposal is influenced by money. By forcing the second house to have 100 ADA is also making it influenced by money (although to a much lessor degree). They can't keep each other in balance if they are influenced by the same thing. Having it only be based on ID for the second house makes it far more immune to the influence of money. Do you disagree?",

If someone is hearing about Cardano for the first time, what are the two or three videos we'd want them to see first? How might we line up additional content depending on the interests that a new community member identifies? It could be interesting to include relevant video content from IOG or elsewhere linked within a starter pack, providing context for someone coming aboard.\n\nIn a way, it's music to my ears to hear you say that the grunt work is in preparing course material, because this is really my wheelhouse, and I know I'm not alone in this. I know that there are other educators within this Catalyst community looking for ways to contribute, and the same is true in the wider Cardano community.\n\nSo while a short term goal of this project is to provide a few examples of starter packs, the medium-term goal is to create the platform where other educators can create, share, and iterate on starter packs of their own.

    "Comment": "Does this require hydra's scalability to be fully functional? Ethereum has bad network congestion from everything running on it.\n\nAlso Decentraland has a central entity that decides which server hosts to run it on. I read they are attempting to change this to being based off voting, though. While I like the theory of keeping it spread out among many different server companies, the rea world tends to centralize (even bitcoin). Cardano is still attempting to be the first anti-centralizing entity. I can see a world where all of the server hosts sites are bought up by a single entity for economic reasons. Or maybe in the end there are only two or three server host entitiies because they all merged due to economies of scale. It is very easy for two or three entities to collude. Are you concerned about this possibility? Is there anyway to build a decentralized server system first before actually building decentraland? For example, if all phones and computers pool their resources in a decentralized fashion they could possibly host decentraland in a decentralized fashion. But this infrastructure doesn't exist yet. It just bothers me personally to have a middle man (the server hosts) profiting off of a decentralized utility system. I am paranoid because I think it will always cause problems with censorship and dictator behavior long-term. Twitter, facebook, and youtube now censoring people is a perfect example.",

    "Comment": "Hi everyone. Elaborating on the importance of using Cardano's $ADA within Pavia:\n\n  \n\nPerhaps the best example is the currency of Decentraland ($MANA) which is an erc20 token build on ethereum.\n\n  \n\nLink: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/decentraland\n\n  \n\nCurrently $MANA has a Market Cap of $120 million with $42 million in 24 hour trading volume. The previous ATM Market Cap was a little over $365 million.  \n  \nOf course not all buying sand selling in Decentraland is in MANA as you can also trade assets in $ETH, on Opense for example.\n\n  \n\nIn 2018 a digital land transaction took place for a whopping $215,000. Assuming that wasn't a publicity stunt, it would demonstrate a huge confidence in this evolving technology.\n\n  \n\nThe Sandbox Game will soon release their currency $SAND. Although they are very much a gaming platform.\n\n  \n\nThe beauty of developing this project and adding $ADA as the native currency is the infrastructure, the community, and confidence is already there. The heavy lifting has already been done. It is just a question of integration things into the new platform.\n\n  \n\nI am sure you will agree that aside from the obvious benefits of developing this digital world and the huge impact of land ownership that the extra liquidity and use cases for $ADA will be epic! :)\n\n  \n\nAs stated I can seed fund this, so no funds required, 0, it will self-fund from the initial land sale onwards and I have marketing partners on standby. I just need the support of the community and the digital Cardano world will become a reality much sooner than people realise! Then the real fun starts...\n\n  \n\nPlease do connect with me if you feel you can add value to this proposal.\n\n  \n\nThank you everyone. Morgan.",

I think this is a wonderful place to get us on a basic baseline before this gets really kicked off in the next 5 days!\n\nI have a bit of long term speculation to bring up too you. The rate we are going in this entire space is that machine to machine transactions will dominate the majority of the on chain transactions.\n\nDo we want the machine to vote vs humans?\n\nDo we want wallets to vote?\n\nDo we want a hash that represents an economic ID participant in Prism to \"show for\" that vote?\n\nHow do you suggest the initial funnel of proposals happens? Maybe we can limit on when proposals cant be submitted, perhaps make a 1 month window 6 times a years. That will give time for the community elected folks to run through (democratize some how) them. Maybe a proposal goes straight to the on chain environment first and that step is taken care of.\n\nLots in the air. Looking forward to the future regardless.",

    "Comment": "One of the things I would like to see in the voting is that the VOTEs a proposal got worked out to equal a portion funding available that round, no matter if your proposal got the least amount of VOTEs.  \n\nSo for example, if there was $250k in the pot every proposal verified real that got VOTEs would some funding, it could even be just a $100 worth of ADA. Not saying that its 1 for 1, but some % based with the top 10 or whatever get the most % spilt between them but there would always be support if your idea reached say a $100 threshold.  \n  \nI was part of Adam Berks first Experimental mirco investment customer validation incubator where startups/entrepreneurs got invests anywhere from a few hundred bucks to a few thousand to run customer development experiments using lean startup principles to prove their ideas. I can personally tell you take living a bootstrap budget when I received mirco funding from the program it was a blessing and lead to many discoveries. Adam is up to something cool again I just found out https://medium.com/@adamberk/the-first-startup-fund-powered-by-blockchain-44a56744ec3a  \n\nMy point is that we want voting to be fair and reach and have the greatest impact them everyone who is willing to put in effort on a proposal that gets VOTEs from people who own ADA should get some amount of funding even if it is just enough to test something about the idea and report and with results.  \n  \nMany people are lvining and trying to startup on even less than I am blessed to have, so I know there would be people who would submit proposals that even $100 could help them reach the next milestone.  \n  \nIt could be as simple as something like:\n\nTop 10 gets 50% of funds divided based on VOTEs  \n\n11-20 gets 25% of funds divided based on VOTEs\n\n21-Any gets 25% of funds divided based on VOTEs  \n\n  \n\nI know you are more focused on clearly understanding what \"counts as a VOTE\" but it is also equally important to have clear understanding of \"what that VOTE is worth\".  \n  \nHopefully, Cardano can soon offer all of us more clarity on this topics :)",

Would you be willing to host the website in a decentralized manner so that nobody can censor it? Otherwise, if you pass control of the website to someone else, they may have different views on how it should be run. Tbh I have no idea if a decentralized website is even possible.\n\nI also like how this method of fundraising may not need heavy regulation since delegators aren't risking anything by supporting you.

This idea could work hand in hand as an incubator where experienced devs taught, interested devs learned hands-on building the jobs entrepreneurs and businesses are posting to the accelerator.  \n\nAlso, I think it would be better to also have it be a little more like https://www.fiverr.com/ where the Developers would post profiles and skills and you could contact them to share your job and see if they accept. Some people who are looking for developers are not going to want to maybe share details about their idea or dev work. I think it could be an option if you were willing to share all that info publicly, but if you are working on something special and don't want trolls with deep pockets to just copy and paste your idea and build it while you look for a dev, then you need to have a way for hiring parties to find devs without spilling all the beans :).\n\nI would be an early adopter of an idea like this!",

Just building on this feedback:  \n  \n\" This principle has a lot of potential for the eco-system as it provides an incentive for devs and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano \"  \n  \nPerhaps I didn't explain just how much development work will come out of this proposal. Once the digital land has launched, entrepreneurs and developers can build their ideas and businesses in the real world landscape AND in the digital land. They can chose to service customers in one or both 'realms' For example:  \n  \nA developer can buy or rent a land parcel (or combine to make a much larger estate) then develop it into an eye-catching attraction. Perhaps even into a game, or even just a HUGE billboard, advertising their services. When visitors come to (New) Pavia they will be able to engage with the Dev and experience his/her work in full effect. As a result they may instruct that Dev to carry out work for them either in the digital word or for a 'real world' based DApp. Better still a multi-verse solution!!  \n  \nOr maybe an art dealer has had to close their bricks and mortar shop due to the pandemic. They can set up a virtual store in (New) Pavia and exhibit their collections. They can sell NFT (tokenised) works of art as collectibles and even negotiate sales of the real pieces for delivery in the real world. Taking payment in ADA of course! Other than the up front cost to buy (or rent) the land parcel and the digital store front the ongoing costs are negligible. Certainly far less than a traditional store.  \n  \nOr perhaps a well know casino would like to open a digital casino in (New) Pavia? A library, a t-shirt store, an online VR school, The list is truly endless once we remove the barriers of our regular world.",

I have gone as far as pay Haskell developers I found on Fiverr that were willing to study this https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/tutorial and let me know if it was something they wanted to help me with. I contacted over 10 devs and 1 took the job. I have paid him to give me an overview lesson in Haskell and to now try and learn Marlowe to help me learn how to use Blockly. And just recently had a lady who was trying to sell me Web DEV services on LinkedIn, I asked her if she had Haskell or blockchain experience, she said no but was willing to learn, so I shared the Tutorial link with her and she said she would get back with me in two weeks. So I will share what her learning experience was and ask her what would help her become a Cardano developer. But personally, it would be awesome if there was a team that knew about Plutus and Marlowe that could do screen shares to build with Blockly while those interested watched and tried it out as well. It think it would help me learn big time!",

And those holding DEEDs to New Pavia had a right real-world assets held by the community. Based on the person's DEEDs they held dividends would be sent to your wallet as NEXO does now with their earning.  \n  \nSo people buying virtual land in New Pavia would actually be investing in their future and the ADA they spent in-game would creating real-world value for them if they learned to hold their DEEDs.  \n  \nThis is something I am trying to do with Investment Group Properties in a way and would love to work with you to see how we could team up on the concept of virtual worlds and gaming as a financial education and wealth-generating platform.",

    "Comment": "@shapiro21  thanks for your feedback. yes hydra could introduce some diversification in terms of value-added services. The pools can decide to run or not those hydra channels, which are high-throughput heads that could facilitate transactions/commerce that require those volumes.\n\nWhat you are describing with a portfolio of tokens though will probably run on the main chain and here SPOs won't have any choice but support those transactions/tokens. Their choice could be to accumulate those funds and provide their stakeholders with additional rewards (if they actually go up) or not take a risk and just dump them in the market as they pose a risk to their earnings.\n\nEither way, this functionality isn't even in the design stage and from my understanding of Duncan, supporting transaction in native tokens is an extremely hard problem to solve.... we may not see it in the foreseeable future.\n\n  \n\nIn the meantime we need to have a mechanism that looks beyond tokens and sources value from outside the ecosystem. For example: SkyLight Pool will offer free research on Cardano and anything that will live on Cardano (tokens, smart contracts, etc.) so its stakeholders can understand the fundamental nature of those assets before making any decision to buy them.\n\nAnother pool could grant its stakeholders exclusive rights to premium features of its app (Pegasus stakepool comes to mind). If we gather a group of such pools we could all agree to grant free access to each other's stakeholders in a form of association. Here we could build real businesses, source funding from interested parties and improve network decentralization... it is a win-win-win.",

    "Comment": "From my understanding of how hydra works, it seems to me that hydra will automatically create a second dimension of value for stake pools. The way I understand it, every hydra channel is dedicated to a specific token. So if there is a stake pool with 5 hydra channels: 3 could be dedicated to ADA and the other two could be dedicated to two different native tokens on cardano. In this scenario, a delegator picking this pool isn't just maximizing his ADA profits; he is also maximizing which native tokens he wants to invest in. I should add this assumes the rewards are paid in the native tokens.\n\nIn this context, stake pools naturally become investment portfolios for delegators to pick from. Maybe I decide to run 6 ADA channels for my pool while SKY pool decides to have 2 dedicated to ADA, 2 dedicated to a music streaming dapp, and 2 dedicated to a VR game dapp. In this situation, even if my pool has lower fees than yours, delegators may still pick your pool to have a diversified investment.\n\nI could be wrong about how hydra works but if this is correct, a second dimension will be added automatically by hydra. Perhaps pooltool.io can just be used for people to read up on which channels pools are running.\n\nThe geographic diversity could also organically follow from this in the case that delegators want to invest abroad. Assuming two equally performing stake pools but one is in the US and one is in Ethiopia, if they both are dedicated to Ethiopian tokens, which would you pick? In this case where they are equally reliable pools, I would choose the one in Ethiopia because they actually have boots on the ground. They actually know what the day to day is like.  \n\nThoughts?",

    "Comment": "@workshopmaybe  thank you for your comment. You raise a good question! I like to think about the issue in terms of scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: we don't do anything, which means that stake pool services will be commoditized and our entire pool fleet will eventually migrate to the cheapest possible infrastructure run by 2-3 companies (offering EUR6 vps).\n\nWhile it may seem like a rational decision by the market (to maximize returns) such an outcome actually increases the risk for the entire ecosystem, such that these 2-3 companies could effectively control the Cardano's network.\n\nScenario 2: We will create avenues for pools to offer value added services for their stakeholders such that their increased costs are eventually more than justified by the value the stakeholders will extract from becoming automatic subscriber to these services.\n\nIn scenario 1 you risk your entire infrastructure on a technical level, meaning anything built on top will be at a huge risk. Decentralization won't exist and we are unlikely to attract talent and adoption because we can't guarantee security/uptime.\n\nIn scenario 2 you create economic incentives to push for geographic and technical decentralization by introducing additional dimensions for pool evaluation. These will ultimately lead to keeping Cardano itself decentralized even though access to information to make staking decisions could be centralized.  \n\nTo counter the urge for one entity to control all information flow we have to consider alignment of interests. Such a platform will operate as a business and will only benefit if stake pools were uncensored in their quest to create value. Think about it as a market place. We provide the infrastructure and the tools for stakehoders to make the decisions. The more SPOs and stakeholders join, the more diverse their offerings and interaction the better it will be for the business and the ecosystem.  \n\nThat said, we can thing of various feedback loops with checks and balances to keep us aligned with the spirit of decentralization. To achieve that we could completely open-source our methodologies and form governance structures that will oversee our analytical frameworks.",

    "Comment": "Steve, I really like this idea, especially in light of the number of pools currently \"promising\" to use x% of their staking rewards toward some cause. We can choose whether or not to take an SPO's word for that, but for now there's no accountability. Soon that will change, and I think that individual pool governance can be a great way to help people understand the broader power of Cardano. We might even draw the analogy that governing a stake pool is like running for city council, while being a delegated expert in Voltaire is like running for parliament.\n\nI also like how your idea gets at variety: there can be different stake pools that are trying to accomplish different things. \"This\" pool is a great source of start-up funding, while \"that\" pool is a great network if you're into saving endangered species, and so on. All the while, non-operators will see the central role that pools play in the network.\n\nWhat ideas do you have for on-boarding potential delegators to this sort of model? How will we show casual ADA holders that this idea is valuable, and how can we build toward delegators taking a gradually more active role in the community?

    "Comment": "@wunderbaer  The short answer is I actually don't think this is an issue because it would not be in the best interest for the developer but hear me out. The biggest reason against this concern is that blockchain is meant to get rid of the middle man. Imagine two blockchains that do the same thing. One of them only has the minimum fees for the necessary transactions while the other has extra fees so that the creator can profit from it. The first blockchain would be significantly cheaper than the second. You don't even need to consider how the average cost of living per year is several orders of mangitude greater than what only paying the minimum fees would yield. In other words, there is no profit in the developer stealing your idea and building the dapp. They would put in all of the upfront costs and get nothing in the end. Blockchain tech is supposed to stop people like Mark Zuckerberg from profitng off of you using a public platform. The only people who will profit are the stake pool operators.  \n\nAnother reason is less important but I think is still significant. It continues with how a dapp is meant to be a public utility. Let's say a developer did steal your idea to build the dapp without you. Does it matter? Unless the dapp was built to be a private utility, you would be able to use it which means you got the functionality for free because they stole your idea. If they did build it as a private dapp, well then there is still a huge demand for a public version. Most people in the world are poor. You would add a tremendous amount of demand by building a public version. You could even bring entire markets into the ecosystem. In addition, from what I understand, the treasury is meant to fund applications that would benefit everyone, not fund a private venture. So by teaming up with you, you and the developer could be able to build it on Cardano's dime. If the developer went for the funds without you, it would likely only get funded if it is a public dapp, which means the end result is free for you.  \n\nThe last reason is simpler. If you are an entrepreneur who already has a business and a customer base and now wants to implement blockchain to help, what incentive would a developer have in stealing your idea? They would then also need to build the business and customer base up from scratch. Anyone who has ever tried to start a business knows this is extremely difficult and unprofitable for a long time. It is soooo much better for the developer to work for you at a constant salary.\n\nI do think there will be idea stealing but because of the reasons stated above, I don't think it will happen anywhere often enough to be a real issue. I hope this made sense. If you disagree, please let me know why. I should stress that this platform would be meant for blockchain development, not typical apps.",

An internal vote would occur and a smart contract trade executed. This pool for example may employ a market analyst. Paid in ADA. I think we can create ADA paid jobs within the stakepools.\n\nOther pools may evolve into political structures within the ecosystem lobbying for parameter changes etc.\n\nOthers may build an internal voting system and combine with other similar pools to form a human backed oracle service.\n\nI expect we would see pool alliances evolve and even interpool attacks.\n\nGiven that stakepools are the backbone of the protocol care will be needed.

    "Comment": "@rin9s  Yes our ideas certainly overlap although I would not limit the project to DAOs. I would emphasize onboarding existing communities and small organisations and giving them the option to become more sophisticated.\n\nThe ultimate goal is for a variety of organisations to live on Cardano, all with competing models and causes. The organisations could be charities, profit, non profit, startup partnerships or communities. Users should be able to browse the platform for organisations and join the those deemed attractive. May other features emerge from this idea such as social networking.",

My project focused on creating a platform that will provide modular, flexible governance options for projects that are interested in becoming a DAO.  \nI will also post soon. Perhaps we should see how to unify the ideas @kungfucrypto  @koala.steve  .  \n  \nCan you be more specific @kungfucrypto  - Are you more focused on building the tech infra these projects will use to become a DAO, or on the process of bringing projects into the ecosystem (perhaps with no \"off the shelf\" options for them to use initially).",

    "Comment": "This is such an elegant idea, and seems like a great fit, especially considering that it would be useful immediately. A few questions:\n\n1\\. Do you see any place for a bank of modular or re-usable code within your idea?\n\n2\\. Is there room for community problem solving within this structure? Would there be any competition between developers to win a role solving a poster's problem? Or is the idea more for business partners to meet and form an agreement before starting the work?\n\nReserving judgement either way, I could definitely argue in favor or not of any of these questions. Looking forward to seeing how this idea develops.",

    "Comment": "@workshopmaybe  thanks for the question. Truthfully I don't know if Cardano is the right platform, but they are the only one democratizing impact investments into startups and only place I this kind of opportunity. But some of the reasons I like the idea of building on Cardano is the affordability of transactions. I could not do WTIM campaigns on ETH for example as it would cost too much and we would not be able to give as much to charities and members. Another reason why I like the idea of building on Cardano is they took a long time to develop their platform from watching the mistakes other blockchains have made. Most of the best things I have ever learned have been because of failures and one of the best statements I ever heard was \"a smart man learns from his mistakes, but a wise man learns from others mistakes\". I think this gives Cardano an advantage in the marketplace.",
