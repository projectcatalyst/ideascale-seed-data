Not only do we believe that Cardano will contribute to long overdue solutions to problems facing Africans, but that in doing so, we firmly believe that these solutions will serve as a guiding example to all people of what Cardano can do.

The AfroFinLab Podcast combines philosophical discussions with real investigations about how all people can adopt and use Cardano-based technology.

For our audience, we have two groups in mind: people who are already engaged with blockchain/Cardano and people who are new to the space. For people who are already part of the blockchain/Cardano ecosystem, we aim to discuss the big picture: how do we accomplish the goals of decentralization and of pushing power to margins? What would it mean for Cardano's projects in Africa to be successful? How can all community members contribute?

We also seek to educate newcomers to the space by sharing an overview of what is possible and discussing some of the fundamentals of blockchain and in particular Cardano.

In weekly episodes we will focus on two recurring themes:

1\. High level philosophical discussions about the value of Cardano and the problems it might help to solve.

2\. Real-time interaction with new technologies: for example, live and in real time, collaborating on the writing of a Plutus smart contract that puts in code some of the informal agreements we've made as co-hosts. We hope for this approach to allow all audience members to feel like they too could adopt this technology in response to their own challenges.

More about the team:

Maria: I am an Educator, Cardano Ambassador, Cardano Portuguese official Telegram Mediator, SPO and also run my own channel on YouTube in Portuguese. I´ve learn who scary can this environment be and I think we could attract people bring on different perspectives how to approach the subjects.

My experience in YouTube shows we also need someone who know a bit SEO search engine optimization to attract more and more subscribers. In my journey I learn who to use premiere to edit videos and sometimes I also use Camtasia screem recorder.

In Cardano since Jun/2020 and my Stake pool have less than a month. CARD´s has 2.3 million Adas with 88 delegators. I´ve been talking a lot about Cardano but also about democracy, education, financial freedom and manipulation of information. And the only piece of work I translate as a Ambassador was Charles Interviews as people related to it more than high core IT stuff

OBS: Anything we do in this podcast could be easily replicated in Portuguese or Hindi as it is our 2 mother tongue. (The only cost affected is the production time as we would have all necessary tools)

• 2. Impact - How do you think this proposal can better address the challenge: How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?

Below is the brief summary of our thoughts. Hopefully this will help!

Episode #1:

• Maria and Shweta will talk about ""What is Cardano"" in a non-technical language

• Tell viewers about their journey on how they come from a humble background but now have become an essential part of Cardano (This is to make the viewers, especially women, connect with them)

• Motivate them to become a part of Cardano by highlighting its vision and benefits

Episode #2:

• Maria and Shweta will continue the discussion on Cardano

• Tell the viewers about other women Stake Pool operators to motivate them

• Introduce Plutus & Marlowe languages to users

• Educate the users how they can use these languages to create Dapps

• Make them understand the benefits and how they can earn passive income by creating Dapps

Episode #3:

• Have a guest proficient in Plutus & Marlowe languages

• Guest will show the users briefly on how to use Plutus & Marlowe languages

• Provide links to courses of Plutus & Marlowe languages

Episode #4:

• Current news of Cardano

• Voting system using Cardano

Episode #5:

• Will decide the contents on the basis of response of viewers on first few episodes

• 3. Feasibility - What are ways in which this proposal's budget, plan, scope or team can be modified to make it more likely for the proposal to be successfully implemented?

• We would have 2 people in the team in the beginning

• One researches and presents the subject

• Second one edits and prepares the post on social media

• We start with recorded videos first and with engagement we can progress to LIVE sessions

• Each person would spend 5 hours a week between pre-production, production and final production videos on YouTube

• It would be 10 hours total

• For 6 months, the total labour cost would be $5000 plus non-labour cost of $2854

• Love for Cardano is essential but get paid to do something you love is a new game!

How to judge our success:

Every month we will deliver a report stating the following:

6 No. of subscribers of ""Women Effect""

7 Views per video of ""Women Effect""

8 Likes per video of ""Women Effect""

Unrealistic Challenge presented to the group, if Fund1 Challenge is ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"" then DEVs and entrepreneurs need funding now not 2-4 months from now.

  

The Solution:

Turn the FAKE ADA awarded to Proposal in fund1 into REAL ADA that can incubate and accelerate the creation of Dapps and Businesses on top Cardano in the next 6 months. All Proposals on IdeaScape currently posted qualified for funding in fund1. (Vote YES or NO in the comments)

The funding available in fund1 will be disturbed: (Vote 1a or 2b or 3c in the comments)

1a: Funding distributed based on CLAPs a proposal has, $250k divided by total CLAPs. Every Project Catalyst IdeaScape Member has 1 CLAP to Vote with a day until 04/Sep/20.

2b: Funding distributed evenly across all Proposals(for example $10k for 25 Proposals equals $250k). At Fork Cardano/IOHK sets Total Funding (for example could be $1k to 25 Proposals).

3c: Only FAKE ADA given for fund1

  

Plan:

Please post you VOTE by commenting. Please don't share thoughts about this proposal or other ways we could do it, please just VOTE based on the above presented.

Capital inflows from the traditional financial system are a crucial part of growth for Cardano as it gains prominence in the world. To do that effectively we need to increase our visibility by highlighting the true capabilities of the platform. That requires nuanced approach to analysis and investment discussions.

Through this podcast we can narrow the gap that exists between the traditional finance and crypto and ultimately remove the mental roadblocks that hinder crypto adoption in the financial world.

I am happy to play this role but I think we need to more clearly highlight this role of proposal ""advisor"" as someone who will play a servant role in helping new Cardano devs/builders/entrepreneurs flesh out their ideas in a proposal for funding. Imo this is a USP of Cardano you don't see in other competing projects. The bottom line is we need to ensure devs have all the tools they need to build (Adrestia, Marlowe, Plutus, documentation) and then get out of their way (by streamlining all other processes such as creation of proposal for funding, idea refinement, etc.). I want to maximize their time spent heads-down developing their Cardano integration/application. I could even see this being apart of the Cardano developer/entrepreneur resources section as a way to ensure them early in the process their is a structure and format to receive funding (which community members will help streamline for them). I think this is a huge signalling and incentive factor for devs today. Even in my current discussion with Jeronimo its clear he wants to build a lot on the platform but the bloke has no clue where to go for funding (and he will be spending a lot of day hours building these integrations). I think we add some structure to this process by including a section on both official Cardano.org sites in a ""developer resources"" tab as well as make this a clear USP we drive in the Cardano developer hub virtual platform.

You will all remember my first proposal for Pavia - Cardano's virtual world which will be built on tokens (equivalent to ethereums erc721 NFT's) which was met with great reviews. Thank you :) I hope that idea demonstrated my passion for native assets.

  

Then I watch this from the man himself, Mr CH: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1BgTNmn2AM&feature=emb_logo

  

Blown away.

  

Obviously I cannot submit a full proposal at this stage due to no funds in this round (the full proposal will have to wait until October) but there is nothing to stop me utilising my first movers advantage - with your help of course!!

  

So, whilst I can speak with my sister and her husband who just so happen to be podcast pro's, any and all feedback from my fellow collaborators would be hugely beneficial to me.

  

Also what better way to launch Cardano's digital world than with a podcast - to me it seems like the perfect fit!

  

If this were a a full proposal for real funds:

  

1\. What could I do to secure your vote?  
2\. What content would you love to see?  
3\. How could I prove my passion for tokens & assets?  
4\. What should I not say or do?  
5\. Perhaps I should produce a taster podcast?  
6\. Anything else?

When you go to ethereum.org you can see how simple it is to get to the right place \*even before you arrive on the landing page\*. The way the information is displayed both in the search bar and when you arrive on the site is the level of streamlined ease we need to build into Cardano.org The UX of selecting the 1st subtab in the searchbar for Cardano.org (Cardano Documentation) needs to be cleaned up a bit and arguably pushed further back (also allow for users to go from the documentation to Cardano.org). Developers should see Adrestia, Plutus, and Marlowe (ideally from within the tab by replacing the 1st tab: Cardano Documentation with the Discover Cardano tab and letting the first 3 options on the Developers tab clickdown be documention (Adrestia, Plutus, Marlowe), relevant playgrounds, and any additional tooling that comes with Goguen.

https://ethereum.org/en/ does a nice job of getting devs to their Solidity smart contract resources easily, we need to make it even easier.

A related Idea and one I introduced at the end of our intial call last week involves creating learning material for devs and entrepreneus who want to integrate/build on top of Cardano. Take the plutus architecture map diagram below and build some level of interactiveness to the layout of diagram (i.e. if a developer only wants to interact with a part of the Plutus application backend they should just click it from the diagram and be taken to all Plutus application backend resources related to the interfaces). Even cooler if they could just click it and see a general popup description of what the functionality that piece of Plutus controls and decide if they need to go further or select something else (maybe something in the wallent frontend for example). This is how I think about streamlining developer onboard/bootstrap phase. Having this type of documentation prepared pre-Goguen mainnet is key to drive adoption over the next 6-8 months imho. This seems to be a low hanging fruit I would be happy to take an initial jump on.

Also ways to gamify the Plutus learning experience will be key. The Udemy course and Plutus book are great as well but thats not going to scale the same way gamifying the dev learning experience will be. Take this Solidity learning game for example: https://cryptozombies.io/en/solidity

Devs in ""game"" can select their Solidity smart contract difficulty level from beginner - intermediate all the way up to Master - Advanced and leave with a complete understanding of ethereum smart contracts. Imho we need to introduce a similar ""gamified"" learning experience for Plutus platform!

  

I am collapsing this project idea into the Fork of Gitcoin for Cardano I think there are clear synergies between these two proposals and the aim is to develop a complete Cardano developer centric platform to serve the entire ecosystem (including every project deployed on top of Cardano).",I hope to streamline the onboard process for new devs taking a 1st look at Cardano.

I know IOHK has a separate fund for DeFi products but I believe a bottom up approach (similar to what's being proposed for voting experiments in fund1) is a nice balance to meet in the middle. Great ideas will emerge from both and I would like to think more about how the related proposals I have tagged can help us get there.The chart below highlights some of the defi primitives on ethereum and cosmos I believe are key make their way to Cardano.

I would approach this similar to the way similar ""Ethereum killers"" just now coming to market are addressing the defi bootstrapping problem,help teams working on Cardano defi secure funding and providing strategic resources they need to build great products.

Take a decentralized exchange (dex) for example, Uniswap is a popular example of this on Ethereum today. Providing resources in a curated list for new devs just starting to think deeply about dex construction in Haskell will certainly streamline their development lifecycle.

In the link below a dev began cloning a popular centralized exchange (London Stock Exchange SETS system). Can we hire this dev to finish this and deploy it on Plutus? If not how can this code serve as inspiration to the dex's we want deployed on Cardano. Update: Devs are already responding, some inquiring more on the process of deploying their Haskell built applications to Plutus. Update to the Update; I am having the most success actually just finding the Haskell application equivalents to the DefI blocks and reaching out to these devs with a Plutus pitch. Good news is Cardano is starting to make waves in the Haskell dev community, downside is this is going to be a somewhat tedious (low-level) process until the entire Plutus platform is deployed to an IDE testnet devs can build against. If you are curious as to the type of products I plan on working with Haskell devs on once a few MVP dex's launch (i.e. Cardano versions of Uniswap/Bancor) check out this link to the Serum project ideas devs are receiving grants to build (keep in mind Serum is a dex orderbook, all of these products will deploy on top of Serum which is deployed on the Solana blockchain): https://projectserum.com/blog/project-ideas.

The first order of business is several Cardano dex's to service the many new asset pairs we except to see post Multi Asset Ledger launch. I will iteratively begin working down the defi product list from there including on the CEX side where I am already talking to Haskell devs about repurposing the LSE SETS application in Haskell and building a ""Stock exchange as a Service"" financial application that integrates into the Atala Prism lineup but can deploy on the public or permissioned side of Cardano.

I have already reached out to most of these devs to gauge their interest in deploying their applications on Cardano. Wil be creating proposals for those who show interest.

Some threads for anyone who wants to go on a defi 2.0 ride. We are watching ethereum go down rapid experimentation phase in defi. This proposal is focused on taking the best ideas emerging in defi-land and working with Haskell fintech devs who have already constructed similar applications in the existing legacy finance world to port them into Plutus/re-purpose them for crypto products to be built on top. This is 100% the move IMHO and all it takes (if we construct proper incentives, secure funding, and provide strategic support!) is 10-20 bright fintech Haskell devs to build out the v1 of these projects. I have already had somewhat deep discussions with 5 and I have been working only part time on this effort in the last few weeks.

Its centralization stops it from evolving. Decentralizing school authority = disruption.,,http://ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBYHe,NO,,no contributors,,,,0.00,0%,0%,0%,13/Sep/20,false,"In order to begin this process, funding would be required to create the SRO and work to establish protocols for schools and universities to use.","This project would seek to establish a self-regulatory organization (SRO) that would be responsible for establishing protocols and standards for schools and universities to use when moving their transcripts to the blockchain. MIT has already moved some transcripts to the blockchain and have proven that it is possible. Below is an explanation for why this is an important project.

The industrial revolution era education systems that we still employ are in desperate need of disruption. In the current system, schools and universities have absolute authority over both access to the education and what courses make up a degree.  

This primary authority of a school or university is derived from its ownership of the transcript. The transcript both allows schools and universities to enforce their graduation requirements and acts as a stamp of authentication of a student's knowledge, skills, and degree completion when applying to a job or other school. In many ways, the transcript is the glue that holds the entire educational system together. It enables the authority of education to remain centralized within the school or university system.

By moving transcripts to the blockchain, educational experience will be able to be verified without a piece of paper from the institution. Once this happens, blockchain transcripts will very quickly decentralize the authority of the school or university. With blockchain transcripts, the authority of education will be transferred to the student because they will be able to go out, get educational experiences from various sources, and create a more robust resume. It will lessen the importance the school's or university's ability to control the system, and it will effectively transfer that ability to the student. Instead of listing a degree from a university on a resume, someone would eventually present a blockchain hash containing a deeper portfolio with courses, experiences, and samples of work that the student has accumulated. The blockchain transcript might be made up of credits from some traditional college courses, internships with corporations, and some work experiences done with a nonprofit.

Once this happens, I envision most businesses and nonprofits jumping onboard to offer educational experience ""credit"" for an individual's portfolio. Their entrance into the transcript market will create true disruption to the educational system worldwide. Imagine graduating from high school, going straight to work for Microsoft and, after four years, earning enough educational credits to receive a bachelor's degree in computer science.

The integrity of the current educational system is maintained by a strict accreditation process. Decentralizing the authority of the educational system will therefore require that the accreditation system be upgraded and expanded to be able to manage blockchain protocols and the ability to accredit alternate educational experiences.

It is possible that every school, business, and nonprofit alike would have its own educational currencies.

In order to make this work, the following steps would need to take place:

1\. A SRO, similar to ICANN, would need to be established to govern the standards and protocols for blockchain transcripts. The SRO would also be responsible for authenticating an institutions' ability to grant transcript credits.

2\. Resources/education would need to be provided to regional accrediting agencies to aid them in the ability to expand their reach to easily accredit business and nonprofits. They will need to create micro-approvals that would accredit non-profits and corporations for certain skills.

3\. Schools and businesses will need resources to be able to create educational currencies.

4\. Third-party Dapps will need to be made to serve the new ""resume"" system. Products need to develop ways to graphically organize, visualize, and evaluate a collection of educational currencies into a cohesive experience.

Cardano's cross chain interoperability to wrap coins would serve as the ideal platform for gathering, storing, and representing a diverse portfolio of educational currency credits on an international scale. They would basically be ""wrapped credits.""

The idea Skoowls has, is to create a decentralized platform, where people meet from all over the world, 24/7 the whole year long. The platform holds interaction between the educators (professors, teachers, trainers) and participants (students as well other people in general who are interested for more education).

Skoowls provides cross border knowledge and education, based on the blockchaintechnology so there won't be interference by any third entity (censorship resistant). Working with blockchaintechnology also means, that all the data and information will be securely stored. This, ofcourse, is something very usefull and convenient for especially educators and the participants.

At third, making use of blockchain, also means people from all over the world can pay each other fast and easily with, for example, ADA.

Skoowls will deliver on demand education, (private) courses and training. Skoowls will be like the Uber and AirBNB in the education and learning space. When ever, where ever, personal delivering without the need of middlemen.

Skoowls willl provide lots of opportunities for both professors, teachers and trainers(educators) as for companies, staff and students(participants) across the globe.

Anyone can participate, whether you are from Ethiopia, Malaysia, Japan, The Netherlands, Venezuela or the United States.

b. Publish common themes/elements (plug-in ""slots"").  
c. Build a production-ready software with first plugins.

2\. So far we have -

\- Deployed a prototype on ETH, tested it in a closed-alpha testing round.  
\- Conducted surveys with the OSS community,  
\- Begun composing case studies on existing OSS governance solutions (Redis, Python).  
\- Started designing the governance model framework on which modules will be added (See attached).

For Torus, I'm currently acting as president, product manager, and principal developer. As we accelerate, I expect to spend more and more time on product management and less time programming.""

  

Main challenges -  
1\. Resolving issues of intellectual property,ownership, and control, before being able to move forward (the core idea is decentralized governance through existing OS projects).  
2\. Finding relevant developers beyond the founder to create the framework.  
3\. Discovering and collaborating with OS projects that can get serious about going DAO.

**Auditability -**

Question (Steven Aldrich) :

""Funding required is not defined. There is no way to actually vote on undefined funding requests.

I would suggest that funding request be modeled in such a way that it looks across several Catalyst Rounds (Fund2 -> Fund(n)) so as to have a greater potential for adoption in each Fund.""

Answer:

See below in feasibility the goals for Fund2. I believe we will need to flesh it out but for now the budget required here is basically that of a small startup. So it's up to the community to see if we want to have -

\- Lean financing:

Would require full time employees (for the first year) -

1 Lead developer

1-2 Senior developers

1-2 Business/Design/Marketing

\- Or a longer growth plan that will start with a similar team (with expanded budget, capabilities, and objectives) that will aim to expand rapidly (probably up to 20 people by the end of the first year would be very fast indeed, as an example).

In short - for the first 6 months we are looking at somewhere in the region of ~$200,000. For a longer horizon it would be substantially more.

This is why I think it's important to discuss and review this before getting into specific costs, because this could become a large scale endeavor.

**Feasibility -**

  

What are ways in which this proposal's budget, plan, scope or team can be modified to make it more likely for the proposal to be successfully implemented? :

  

**Next Steps with Budgeting and Milestones (given full funding and staffing):**

1\. Collect knowledge base of known governance models in use in open source software today

2\. Write research papers to analyze each of the collected governance models, assessing where they lie on the following scales: centralization, codability, effectiveness in the community

3\. Analyze research papers together to confirm whether our proposed ""layers"" design has layers that represent the most important aspects of collected models in aggregate.

4\. Design ""plugin"" software components for each ""layer"" That encapsulate codified functionality of each governance model.

5\. Use acquired knowledge to propose a new governance model that fits well with the needs and pains we are observing in OSS and the benefits that blockchain has to offer. Design plugin components.

6\. Draft a white paper to summarize the work we have completed so far, our proposal for a blockchain-based governance system that can support the existing models and a new model.

7\. Find collaborative OSS partners in the community to validate market fit, lock in early ""buyers,"" and iterate rapidly based on their feedback.

8\. Prototype smart contract software to determine best approach for implementing on the Cardano blockchain. In parallel, begin design of user experience (information architecture, workflows, and wireframes) and visual design system.

9\. Build front and back-end application, to Alpha

10\. Iterate in collaboration with collaborative OSS partners

11\. Beta (incl. iteration)

12\. Customer relations, ask for commitments from partners, marketing beta signups, etc.

13\. 1.0 launch","1\. Develop Flexible Gov. Modules.

I just needed to cement this idea on the PORTAL!!

  

I believe, as a collective we should explore and potentially trial this idea in the near future. Perhaps some funding to offer a base 'salary' for the newly appointed Cardano Onboarding Consultants and perhaps a small percentage paid from the entrepreneurs of secured funding once proposals are successfully passed as a larger incentive to onboard new users.

  

Fully supported by the Cardano community these experts can network with and approach businesses and entrepreneurs to actively encourage them to build on Cardano. The base 'salary' idea would prevent the need for charging clients for initial advice and guidance and helping with proposals.

  

What a killer job that would be. It wouldn't even feel like a job.

  

Initial thoughts only. Lots more to follow….!  
  
_________________________________________________________________________________________

Update as promised:

  

So we need new businesses and entrepreneurs to develop on Cardano and we want them to deliver rapidly?

  

Some may need funding - many other may not need funding. So parking the idea of governance and the voting process etc for the sake of simplicity. How about this is what we do:

  

1\. Select an initial sample group of keen potential consultants. Perhaps they are already among us? Maybe you?!

  

2\. Devise the renumeration structure for a trial period. An amount per month for a 3-6 month trial as a part time base 'salary' Plus some form of bonus paid by either the project when they successfully launch on Cardano OR when the project secures funding from a later round (all to be decided) This is the only tricky part, but not impossible.

  

3\. Devise formal contracts and a proof of identity / proof of position to reduce scammers (they will come!) We will need KPI's.

  

4\. Ensure the consultant has a crash course in exactly what Cardano can offer business owners and entrepreneurs. This can indeed link to other projects but this should not wait for those as this can be very quick to launch. (Sorry!)

  

5\. Ensure the consultant knows where to direct interested parties to find what they need. How DApps and businesses can actually launch on Cardano and a sound understanding of the proposal and voting process. Of course this will develop as the project does.

  

6\. Ensure the consultant has a book of contacts for technical queries - not to be shared outside of this space (as per the contract)

  

7\. Devise a method of tracking what entities the consultant is engaging with and what stages they are at in their development. Even something as simple as a Monday board would do the trick.

  

8\. Set weekly / fortnightly consultant meetings to discuss developments and opportunities. Pass on those great ideas! Check KPI's.

  

9\. Agree a handoff process for very large opportunities, for example a huge multinational - perhaps this should be handed over to someone in a senior position in IOG or even CH himself, instead of remaining with the consultant.

  

10\. Develop a local level and a corporate level marketing strategy. It wont take much. I put out a tweet on the Catalyst fund and that received attention but of course we want to bring NEW people in to this space and we will all do this in our own way.

  
11\. Review the trial group and the successes. Refine accordingly and increase the group size as required.

  

Once the process is refined and income proven there may be no requirement for a monthly payment to consultants, however, if I were to commit to this then something else would need to be sacrificed and we all need an income.

The Senate was supposed to give every state an equal vote while the House of Representative was supposed to give extra weight to states with a larger population. The state and the population were relatively independent and therefore were influenced by separate incentives. This is what kept them balanced. Having both houses vote on each issue ensured that most incentives were accounted for in the vote.

However, the revolving door between Wallstreet and Congress changed this. The representatives in Representative Democarcy are the weakest link in the system because they can be bribe. Arguably, the decline in the US government over the past half century is a direct result of indirect bribes (usually a cushie job after leaving office). These bribes have resulted in both houses being incentivized by the same thing: money. And because they are now incentivized by the same thing they can no longer keep themselves balanced. The US founding fathers warned that this could lead to failure of government. So far it seems to be true.

It is crucial Cardano gets this right if it is to survive long-term. I propose two houses should be used that are completely independent of each other. By using liquid democracy with these two houses that I am about to describe, the weakness of Representative Democracy should be largely mitigated. The influences of the Wallstreets of the world will be virtually eliminated.

The House of ADA:

The first house is the same thing that has been tried by others. 1 ADA = 1 vote. This gives extra weight to those that have a larger stake in the system similar to how the House of Representatives gives extra weight to those states with larger populations.

The Senate of Cardanians:

This is the second house that is required to balance the first house. In this house, each decentralized identity (DID) registered to Cardano gets 1 vote. 1 DID = 1 vote. This should be fairly easy to implement with Prism. A minimum voting age can also be programmed into the blockchain since the age should be easily accessible from Prism. This house is equally weighted among everyone just like the Senate.

By not having a financial requirement for the Senate of Cardanians, it ensures that the Senate of Cardanians will not be incentivized by the same influences experienced by the House of ADA. This feature is crucial for have balanced and stable government.

For all big updates to the Cardano protocols, both houses must vote and agree. It is important to note that for the vast majority of people, a person will automatically be in both houses. If a person has a DID, it is extremely likely that the person also has ADA. As it is, registering a DID on Prism requires a transaction fee in ADA by design.

  

Potential concerns:

1\. What if a person has a DID but no ADA? Do they really have stake and therefore be allowed to vote?

This scenario seems extremely unlikely especially since registration and updates to DID's require transactions fees in ADA. This creates a strong incentive for everyone with a DID to own ADA. However, there are two potential options. The first is that wallets can be easily connect to DID's on the blockchain using zero knowledge proofs. Then Prism can verify that the person has ADA connected to the DID without exposing how much ADA the DID has. With this feature, the voting protocol can be programmed to include only the DID's with at least 1 ADA. This option does weaken the independence between the two houses and therefore is not preferred.

The second option is to not worry that they do not own ADA. By using the DID on Cardano, they arguably have stake in the system. They are using that DID for their commercial actions. They would care about the DID's integrity. In this option, there is no reason to verify if the DID has any ADA associated with it. I think this is the better option and I personally feel that a person owning a DID is enough stake in the system to allow them a vote. By definition of using the DID, they have to care about the system.

  

Research Questions:

Computational modeling may be able to answer the following questions.

1\. In what contexts are bicameral voting systems more reliable than unicameral ones? Are there any contexts where the unicameral system is better? If so, perhaps there are proposal categories that don't need both houses to agree.

2\. What happens if the House of ADA has a high voter turnout while the Senate of Cardano has a low voter turnout? Is the end result still favorable?

3\. What if the situation is question 2 was reversed? Would it still be favorable?

I suggest dedicated resources for researchers to explore these questions.

  

1 Year Budget:

1\. 2 researchers (for diverse perspectives) each at $80,000/yr = $160,000

2\. Computational Equipment = $50,000 (this could be a huge over-estimate; I don't have a reference point)

3\. Setting up sample groups and incentives for experiments = $30,000 with regulatory fees

Total = $240k

This is a joint proposal by me and @eysteinh. We are currently searching for more members to join us.

We are both very passionate about bringing clarity and fairness to decentralized governance. We both have a research background and are adamant to expose better ways for people to collaborate on their own terms. We believe this research initiative by the community itself, if cultivated and nurtured, could grow to become a beacon of high quality knowledge and essential insights for the entire Decentralized Governance community.

  

**Problem Statement**

Decentralized Governance (DG) is at its infancy. New governance structures must be explored and invented to allow for organic growth of self governing, distributed communities.

*DG is intrinsically the only framework within which we will attract developers and other builders to our ecosystem.*

To that end we must ensure that the Cardano governance system is effective, transparent, unbiased, and beyond reproach. In order to achieve that, the community must play an independent role in its evolution, and begin creating its own institutions focused on DG.

The problem is that without an inclusive, balanced, and scientific open discussion around DG ""by the community, for the community"" - *We may find that politics, narrow interests, and miscommunication will hamper a productive discussion which could expedite the journey towards harmonic DG and adoption.*

**Suggested Solution**

We suggest the establishment of a community group dedicated to research and experimentation in the area of DG. A group, which if successful, will aim to evolve to become a DG standardization entity, and ecosystem wide discussion platform & launchpad for DG in general.

The WIP name of the group is the **Organization for Governance Refinement & Emancipation (OGRE).**

OGRE Preliminary Values -

*   **Transparent:** OGRE will act to make public and available all its activities, as well as other DG activities in the space. OGRE is committed to publish, share , and peer review any of its research activities publicly.
    
*   **Scientific:** OGRE will strive to conduct its research, and direct its activities in an unbiased, empiricist, and rigorous manner in alignment with scientific methods.
    
*   **Data Driven:** OGRE is committed to collecting and analyzing data around DG, and to use empirical results to drive the conversation around DG.
    
*   **Neutral:** OGRE will aim to avoid alignment with specific community group, and aspire to include and represent minority groups in the community.
    
*   **Inclusive:** OGRE will act and solicit input across the whole DG ecosystem, aspiring to include members from varied projects and communities.
    

  

Creating a balance and unbiased group that will inspire the trust of all stakeholders in the ecosystem, and will be able to perform as a mediating function within the DG ecosystem, will allow us to set the foundations for future DG community driven initiatives.

One example of implementing OGRE impartiality would be to limit the number of OGRE council members which are position holders, (i.e. Ambassadors, SPOs, Investors, Entrepreneurs, etc.), to a maximum percentage of representation.

**Mission Statement**

Given below are the high level functions that the OGRE declares. Once the first OGRE council is initiated, clear values will be defined, and a full mission statement will be composed. The operational missions of the OGRE are dual -

1.  Perform research in the area of decentralized governance for the enrichment of the ecosystem
2.  Conduct experiments, collect, analyze, and publish data on decentralized decision making
3.  Encourage and assist the Cardano ecosystem develop a mentality that drives decentralization through social processes.
    

  

**Value for Cardano**

Establishing strong community institutions will contribute to Cardano in at least 2 ways -

1.  Generate trust and credibility across the space by legitimizing and growing the synergy between grassroots community initiatives and centralized project entities.
    
2.  Promote Cardano's integrity, by establishing institutions that will serve the entire DG space and bring people from other chains and projects into Cardano's ecosystem.
    

  

**Addressing The Challenge**

*   In the short term OGRE will facilitate the DG conversation between SPOs, the trinity, the community, and whoever else will want to participate.
    
*   In the long term OGRE aims to leverage DO implementation and the evolution of DG, to enable widespread decentralization and adoption of Cardano's infrastructure.
    

  

**Objectives & Goals**

OGRE aims to be client centric and address burning and relevant issues in DG, as they arise in the community.

Some near and long term objectives could include -

*   Standardization/certification of SPO Skill Sets (Cardano SL, Nix, Networking, Security, etc.).
    
*   Standardization/certification of Proposal Consultant and/or others who will enable proposers.
    
*   Standardization/certification of Voting Delegation Experts (as part of late Voltaire releases).
    

  

On the topics above our main goal is to initiate a discussion, collect input, and solicit needs from the community that will lead to community driven standardization of the governance space.

  

*In essence OGRE will aim to become a horn for the community to voice itself on DG, and to take actions to manage its self organization.*

  

**Example Pain Points**

At this time there are several evident pain points in DG that are causing concerns in the community which the OGRE could commit to address -

*   SPO selection, regulation and standardization.
    
*   A Holistic View encompassing all funding processes and decision making within the Cardano project, available to the community.
    
*   Real World data on decentralized decision making.
    
*   Lack of models for the community to use for self organization and structuring.
    
*   Lack of community groups that are impartial and are not susceptible to conflict of interests.
    

  

  

These are just a few examples. OGRE also plans to poll the priorities of the community for topics that require urgent attention to establish its initial agenda.

  

**Requested Budget**

OGRE compensation will be decided on the first OGRE council. For the purpose of Fund1 we consider -

*   OGRE council members as highly skilled workers (~$100,000 US/year).
    
*   2 Council Members - at 50% position for 6 months: $50,000
    
*   1 Assistant - at 25% position for 6 months: $3,000
    
*   2 Advisors - at 3 consultations each during 6 months ($500 per consultation) - $3,000
    

  

  

Total: $56,000 for a 6 months period.

For example an event with 500 tickets for €15.- each will cost you around €1.000.- in fees.

Also for the free service you never know which of your personal information is sold to other entities by Eventbrite and similar services. So what exactly are we looking for:  
  

1) A mobile app & web interface to create the event and enter all the relevant infos about the event itself. As the host you would also create the keys for this event and store them on your phone in order to verify the tickets later.

2) The possibility to define the maximum amount of tickets you want to distribute and the price of each ticket.

3) An interface for your guests to buy/get those tickets and store them directly in the app. Free tickets would only require the guest to pay for the transaction fee in ADA to create the ticket on chain. Paid events would require the full amount (ticket price + TX fee) to be paid in ADA and distributed directly to the event creator.

4) The mobile app would also be used to verify the ticket at the entry using a QR code scan and checking the validity of the ticket on chain

Challenges I currently see:

1) As purchasing of tickets needs at least some ADA to pay for the TX fees, or larger amounts in case of paid events, we would need some kind of fiat onramp for that. As it will often be only very small amounts not sure how that can be handled without too much overhead? This could be the biggest barrier for event creators as each guest needs to hold ADA. For free events we could maybe reverse it and have the creator deposit the needed amount of ada instead, but it's a disadvantage against Eventbrite where free events are free of charge.

2) A small percentage of the ticket price, in case of paid events, shall go to a developer fund to pay for the maintenance and development of the app in the long run. Maybe we could start only with free events for the beginning and establish a fee structure later.

As I said earlier my background is marketing and advertising and I am more than happy to take over that part and the whole business part behind this. The technical side is something I definitely need your support and input if that really works the way I imagined it and after that in developing it.

The proposal is that a Bicameral Voting system be put into place. This means that voting is effectively completed by the user and split into two houses to attempt passage.

On one hand, you have a house that awards more voting power to those with more ADA. The benefits here are clear in that those who have more stake in the system should have a stronger voice than those who have minimal stake.

On the other hand, you have one identity who owns a minimum amount of ADA (100 tokens) who is awarded a vote that stand equal footing to somebody who has 1,000,000 ADA.

The benefit is that for CIP's or Treasury dispersal, proposals MUST pass through both houses with approval before they are enacted.

Draft paper

Why a African Blockchain Centre for Developers is needed?

The world is now being built on code, it's not only brick-and-mortar anymore. Most people don't see an African as a potential world class software engineer, their views about Africa is based on the ads they see on media that solicits for helping a child or to donate to something. We don't believe it's the most efficient or a sustainable way to support Africa!

The African continent is home to an emerging digital ecosystem and not enough light has been shone on the potentials that lies within the continent with respect to its massive talent pool and creativity of the African youth.

For a new rise up of Africa, we believe that we need to give a chance for people who want to make changes to positively impact on society to do so.

As the world continues developing, we have brilliant African minds that are full of ideas and energy but who couldn't find the infrastructure and fund to realize their dreams.

We would like to give them the opportunity to learn at an elite level and get them everything they need to make their ideas and projects a reality.

African Blockchain Centre for Developers aims at creating opportunities providing blockchain Solutions for the world by utilizing the pool of talents working remotely in Africa building solutions for developers, start-ups, enterprises, and governments. This center has a vision to help bridge the developer-skills gap in Africa by providing better access to high-quality, world-class skills on blockchain technology.

Our main goal is finding talented and motivated people to provide them with the skills and means necessary to perform at an elite level. Following this, we would like to give them opportunity to work, developing their own projects or to place them with partner companies looking for this talent(s) which will in turn create a global developer community for the cardano network.

In-depth look into the concept of the African Blockchain Centre for Developers

The proposed mission of the African Blockchain Centre for Developers (ABCD) is to stimulate the establishment and growth of technology-based start-up companies and other compatible businesses.

By fulfilling this mission, ABCD will concretely contribute to job creation, businesses on boarding to Cardano ecosystem, creation of Smart contracts and Dapps and provide for enhanced economic health to Africa while promoting and encouraging adoption of Cardano throughout the continent.

Together with the Cardano Community, ABCD will create, develop and provide open source materials for new and emerging technology specializing in the development of core Cardano blockchain technologies and applications.

These achievements will increase the successful development of emerging businesses in the Cardano blockchain ecosystem by providing training, mentorship, shared space, professional assistance and other value-added services required to thrive. Ideally, businesses that graduate from ABCD's incubator would grow, move out into the community and contribute to the overall vitality, diversity, and growth of Cardano in the booming Africa's economy.

ABCD will provide an environment that allows Africans to take an active role in ""growing their own"" businesses that will lead to job creations. These new businesses and new jobs produced create wealth through multiplier effects that ultimately benefits the overall community beyond the individuals.

ABCD main activities overview :

Developer Training and skills development - ABCD will train and provide a network for developers and many other professionals working with projects in the Cardano ecosystem. ABCD will provide value added services customized to their needs at every step of their learning journey within the Cardano and Blockchain environment.

Business Assistance – Together with the Cardano community and active partners, ABCD will help startups through their early development by providing business advice, resources, contacts and technical support services including guidance and mentoring on business strategy, management, marketing, financial, legal, and product development issues as well as connecting startups with investors.

Facility-Based Services - ABCD will provide developers and start-ups with appropriate rental space and flexible leases, shared business services and equipment, technology support services, and assistance necessary for company growth.

Benefits to Stakeholders

When ABCD will reach its cruising altitude, the center would benefit a wide range of stakeholders.

Benefits to Cardano Ecosystem

ABCD believes that the public's faith in a blockchains value is one of the key factors for adoption. ABCD not only intends to train developers to service projects within the cardano community but also provide technical assistance to local communities to solve inherent african problems on the cardano blockchain by providing an ecosystem that enables blockchain startups flourish.

We think that in order to promote and lead to the adoption of Cardano, we need to show that everything is possible, any useful applications can be developed and integrated to the ecosystem.

Not only applications developed by westerners for westerners, but also by the africans for the africans. And more generally, by the people for the people.

Some of our developers already have promising ideas for some of the most critical issues in Africa.

Benefits to Youth/Unemployed

ABCD ecosystem will enable youths, software engineers, developers and dreamers to kickstart a career in blockchain development, learn Blockchain related skills as well as apply that knowledge in building decentralized applications within Cardano.

Benefits to Start-Ups

Start-ups can collaborate with diverse entrepreneurs as well as solve unique needs for partnerships, suppliers, and/or potential sources of capital. ABCD will help accelerate blockchain startups growth by providing office space and services, mentorship, expertise, influence, and access to capital.

This lowers the overhead and operating costs during critical formative years. ABCD would significantly increase visibility and presence of tenant companies in the marketplace and advance their success potential.

Benefits to the overall African community

ABCD would create new employment opportunities in the blockchain space for africans as well as create higher wage and higher skill jobs.

ABCD activities within the region and then the continent will enhance Africa's image as a progressive, future-thinking place that encourages and supports technology business development.

ABCD will support the community and government in economic development, provision of skilled manpower, increase tax base, improve visibility of host community and improve entrepreneurship in the blockchain sector.

Recruitment process

One of the critical steps to guarantee the success of this project on the long term is the quality of recruitment.

We not only need to find brilliant young developers, we also need to ensure that they will stay within the training center for a certain period of time 3 / 4 years.

Regarding the technical criteria, we would like to discuss with Project Catalyst team what they should be and how they would like us to assess them.

For the pilot phases we already have pre-selected 10 young developers including young talented women. These people will have a solid IT and dev background and are already operational to develop application in several useful languages (Java, Javascript, Python, etc.). They will continue to learn Haskell, Plutus and Marlowe in order to be able to develop their first Dapp as soon as Goguen is available.

Proposed organizational structure for ABCD in Port Harcourt

Staffing

In order to efficiently manage and run the team, we will mainly need developers but also a support team to allow them to mainly dedicate themselves to ""learning and coding"".

In that purpose, on top of the devs, we plan to recruit the follwing profiles :

⦁ Head of centre

⦁ Secretary/receptionnist

⦁ Security

For the pilot phase, the receptionist and security position would be the only paid position at the incubator, the proposed ABCD staffing would include a full-time Director and Operations/programme Manager. The staff would oversee the day to day activities of the centre as well as manage facilities. Subsequent increases in staff strenght depend on increases in workload and funding availability.

Long term goals of the ABCD are to foster the blossoming of professional developer teams throughout the African Continent.

Project director and lead coordinator will be Cardano Ambassador Joshua Akpan. Joshua is known throughout the Cardano Community for his leadership and coordination of Blockchain Meetups, host on The Cardano Community Podcast, boots on the ground, collaborator and advocate for Proof of Africa (POA), Cardano Shelley Summit 2020 Presenter, and Social Media Evangelist for Cardano.

Venue

We have conducted prospects for finding ABCD's offices (rental) and some interesting ones have been selected.

Among them, one on the Woji Road, GRA Phase 2, Port Harcourt, Rivers retain our attention.

This place will allow to host a team up to 60 people with open offices, meeting rooms, conference room, etc. in a secure area.

Until ABCD reaches its critical size, offices and services will be sub-rented to other businesses.

Continuation plan

Within the next 10 years, we intend to develop the project progressively increasing the number of attendees and then expand the initiative in other countries.

Long term activities of ABCD will be:

⦁ Blockchain Training/Education

ABCD will train and enable enterpreneurs launch a career in blockchain and Hyperledger Fabric and gain the essential knowledge and expertise to develop applications in enterprise environment.

We will also provide trainings for scholars, Government agencies, Corporate bodies, private firms and entrepreneurs that need to know and understand blockchain technology and the benefit of developing their applications on the Cardano ecosystem.

⦁ Direct Business Development Assistance

ABCD will provide oversight and facilitate access to resources in other to stimulate sustainable MSME development by improving their general business environment.

⦁ Professional Network and Relationship Support

ABCD will play an active role in developing links with resources that enterpreneurs might not otherwise have access to as small, emerging businesses.

ABCD is already developing a broad-based pool of high-quality professionals that have the technical and business skills needed to support client businesses.

⦁ Educational/Awareness Programs

ABCD would build and maintain up-to-date information resources for technology start-ups as well as host on-site seminars, meet-ups, hackathons and other events of interest to technology start-ups.

⦁ Facility-Based Services

ABCD will provide clients with appropriate rental space and flexible leases, shared business services and equipment, technology support services, and assistance necessary for company growth.

To reach those ambitious but realistic objectives we think that we need to progressively extend our activites following several steps:

Pilot phase (Year 1)

Test phase, opening of a permanent centre in Nigeria for 10 full-time developers in order to test the format, content, level of the attendees to be able to create a tailor-made program to train and support our developers.

Phase 1 (Year 2 - 5)

Replicate the pilot model at larger scale to allow more attendees to get trained.

We already developed a network of more than 50 african developers familiar with Cardano and passionate about the Blockchain ecosystem.

Phase 2 (From year 3)

Replicate and expand the training model in different countries in Africa. We already have a promising contacts with Adidjan university officials in Ivory Coast.

Phase 3 (From year 5)

Opening of permanent centres across Africa applying the lessons learnt from the Nigerian office.

Simple budget and Financial Estimates

ABCD will kickstart operations from a pilot phase (Year 1) estimated at 700 000 adas.

Overall, we anticipate that it will take 5 to 7 years to achieve self-sustainability.

The estimate for 5-7 year period is approximately 18 000 000 adas.

This estimate takes into account the different costs :

⦁ Safety / Fire / Hazards

⦁ Insurance (Full cover)

⦁ Power setup (Generators, Inverter, Powerbank, etc.)

⦁ Server room (CCTV servers, Internet, networking, wiring, etc.)

⦁ Basic working setup (Workstation, display, screen, desks, tables, chairs, whiteboard, etc.)

⦁ Conference and meeting rooms (screen, tables, chairs, whiteboard, etc.)

⦁ Reception

⦁ Kitchen/lounge

⦁ Monthly expenses (electricity, internet, cooling/AC, salaries)

Other initiatives

In the meantime, following the evolution and adoption of blockchain related projects we will seek additional funds within the Cardano community and beyond.

Within the Cardono space, we are already in close contact with IOHK. We work with them on the educational purposes and contents we could create in order to stay aligned with their vision and to avoid overlaps.

On the educational content, we also want to work more closely with Emurgo who already propose high quality lessons around Cardano and the Blockchain.

We going to continue to work closely with PoA team members that have experience in implementing sustainable development projects in Africa and who will use their contacts within International Institutions (i.e. EU, French Development Agency, GIZ, etc.) to gather more resources.

Evaluation plan

In order to keep track on the progresses, we would like to define with the team on what would be the most relevant indicators for evaluating the impact of our project (i.e. Number of attendees to training, papers produced, Dapps developed, Partnerships created, etc.).

We plan to provide the team/community counterparts with a detailed semester activity report and monthly brief updates.

Moreover ABCD will be an important tool in the economic development toolkit in africa that would create new job opportunities for africans, create higher wage jobs, better leverage training/educational materials from IOHK, contribute to the growth,success and adoption of blockchain technology businesses. These factors would provide the long-term metrics against which to measure the success of the Center.

Cooperation with Proof of Africa

The training centre aims at being an autonomous structure but since the founders are also involved in the Proof of Africa stakepool project, we would like to continue to run the two projects in parallel. Our main ideas undertaking this cooperation are:

⦁ rewards generated by PoA could be used to develop ABCD's activities,

⦁ PoA infrastructure (servers, relay nodes, etc.) might be made available to our developers for them to train and gain autonomy in running the Cardano network,

⦁ PoA would benefit from the activities developed by ABCD as a proof of its efficiency and reliability in creating real opportunities in Africa.

As a reminder, PoA is a stakepool which attempts to represent Africa in the Cardano ecosystem. It can be thought as a stakepool-powered adoption driver based in Africa. This initiative is positioned to contribute to the adoption of Cardano in Africa and deeply believe that it will allow African countries to not only diversify their economies but also help the continent to increase its innovation and investment attractiveness.

Achievements so far

To have a more detailed view on what PoA have done for the community so far, please have a look on our several platforms:

After feedback received, perhaps 'New Pavia' is a better name? Thus I have also acquired: www.newpavia.io

I do prefer Pavia. It is cleaner but perhaps we could put this to a vote? :)

* * *

IMPORTANTLY THIS PROPOSAL REQUIRES NO FUNDS. I WILL SEED IT AND AFTER THE INITIAL LAND (GENESIS) SALE IT WILL SELF FUND.

  

1\. I am prepared to invest, by way of a seed fund investment, what is required to form the legal entity required to manage this project, with input from the three pillars of Cardano and the relevant legal teams.

  

2\. I am prepared to fund and develop the theme, conceptual artwork and branding for Project Pavia. Then commence initial marketing. I have a team on standby for this who I have worked with before. They are great.

  

3\. I will create and fund the required websites and processes to launch the Initial Land Sale (Pavia Genesis) to Cardano community members and those in the wider cryptocurrency space. Cardano community members should have first option to secure land, especially pool operators. I envisage 1,000 + stake pools land parcels scattered through Pavia. Each as unique as the pool operator.

  

4\. Upon a successful Initial Land Sale I am happy to commit to full time management and development of Project Pavia as a show of my very serious, ongoing commitment to the project. I will build the team around me to ensure future success.

  

5\. The Pavia Genesis sale will be followed by several more rounds of land sales. By way of example Decentraland sold some 90,000 land parcels at launch. The Sandbox Game is currently selling over 166,000 parcels! There is a very clear demand for these projects and for digital land ownership and development.

  

6\. Funds raised from land sales will be used to further promote and expand the scope of the Pavia Project, they will also fund developers to build out the communal areas and 'estates' (large blocks of land) belonging to IOG, the Cardano Foundation and Emurgo and other partners for the VR ecosystem. The same developers can assist Pavia land owners to make the best of their land parcels which may cause an increase in value and desirability.

  

7\. Unless the community feel otherwise, unlike the other decentralised worlds which are powered by ethereum but have their own currency (such as $MANA or $SANS), Pavia will naturally adopt the native $ADA currency which adds increased liquidity and a much greater gateway to operations both on and off the decentralised word. It makes sense to me. Perhaps we can have a fun token on ADA for treasure hunts etc but the go to currency should be ADA in my opinion.

  

8\. The Project Pavia TEAM will proactively approach those already working with Cardano and invite them to develop within Pavia. For example we can have a Tangem developed land parcel or a New Balance virtual store.

  

9\. A whole host of businesses can be developed in Pavia which include games, DApps, shops, advertising agencies, the list is endless.

  

10\. A Cardano version of the popular erc721 NFT (Non Fungible Token) can be developed, so that collectibles and other merchandise can be produced and bought, sold and traded between community members. This is huge and will create many opportunities.

  

11\. This project will create valuable, ongoing revenue streams for graphic designers and developers. From designing land parcels, coding integration solutions or designing NFT's. I can't stress enough how much work this will generate for skilled Cardano dev's.

  

12\. The digital world gives a platform for business owners and entrepreneurs alike which exceeds the regular 'bricks and mortar' shop or office space as the costs are much more reasonable, the platform offers a global reach without travel restrictions (especially during these troubling times). Truly endless possibilities, the only limiting factor is ones imagination.

  

I am happy to commit to launching this project in a prompt manner, with the backing of the Cardano community. I am so sure of its success that I will even fund the initial costs. From the point of the Initial Land Sale onwards the project will be self funding! It benefits the community as they can own their very own piece of Pavia as well as cool tokens and collectibles. They can buy and sell land and collectibles with $ADA. They can build and promote real businesses within the virtual land. By way of an example, what better place for a Stake Pool Operator to design a futuristic representation of their pool than in Pavia, perhaps once a block is minted by their pool an NFT collectible pops up for those who are passing by to collect. Sounds pretty cool huh?

  

After the initial funds, longevity can be ensured by the developers charging modest development fees for work completed on community members land parcels. We can also raise funds from new NFT's and revenue can be made from selling advertising space, games and sponsorship. Plus, so much more! A minimal fee can be retained on the transfer of assets if deemed necessary. All helping to ensure longevity of the Pavia project.

  

I believe we are looking for quick to market solutions to grow the Cardano ecosystem, I am offering just that and the best of all there is no requirement for any funding! :)

  

I have kept this brief but I am happy for any questions you may have for me :)

  

Thank you in anticipation of your kind support.

The Hub will include meetup space, co-working, library, media, cafe, bookstore, and will focus on the III main directions which correspond to III Cardano phases.

I. Goguen - Meetups, Popularization of Plutus and Marlowe, achieving high-quality developer acquisition, Haskell courses and trainings, assistance to companies that are planning to use Cardano smart-contracts.

II. Basho - We will follow CATO (Cardano Adoption Through Outreach) tactics and will work on interoperability with other blockchains

III. Voltaire - We will study philosophy, political science, and economics, will research, and come up with ideas that can be used in Cardano governance.

As the location of the first hub, we propose Kyiv (Ukraine), but we also have ideas and conversations about North-Western Hub (Washington-Wyoming) and Milan (Italy).

  

The Cardano HUB in Kyiv can use the CIA technique (Cooperation, Integration, Assimilation) in relation to other blockchains. I.e. with some blockchain and project we cooperate, with some we integrate (like Litecoin or BCH), and some - assimilate (many blockchain projects don't really need own blockchain and they can exist on Cardano blockchain and issue their token.).

The Cardano HUB will provide a place for meetups for all crypto projects (therefor showing goodwill, for some - for free, for others on the paid basis). The Hub can start as non-profit but then in some time, Hub can become profitable by providing rent for meetups, selling products (like Cardano merchandise and books), and providing consulting for businesses interested in using ADA.

  

There used to be Blockchain Hub in Kyiv, which shut down half a year ago (because of rent increase) and crypto community doesn't have a place to gather for meetups, and just for coffee/beer.

In 2019 I had experience of starting the first literature crypto bar, which I consider success as the convergence of crypto and other fields. We had a great audience, from crypto-entrepreneurs to members of parliament, diplomats, famous artists, and writers. From the point of business, it didn't have enough time to become profitable, and it had to close due to the problem with real estate. (Landlords took bank loan many years ago, and the bank came to claim their property and took over the place). I started it with my own funds, and I didn't expect to earn money on it, as it's just not the type of business where you can expect big profits (it would be much easier just to keep funds in crypto, or stake). But this was an exciting experience, which I would be happy to use in setting up Cardano Hub. (For example, we had big room enough to fit 60 people, but in Cardano Hub we should have a room for several hundred, at least).

In 2020, just recently Tezos Hub opened in Kyiv (in terms of the grant from Tezos foundation). They will make meetups, hackathons, etc. It's located not in center, so I suppose it will work in ""closed-mode""

But my idea of HUB is completely different. Yes, we will make hackathons and meetups. Weekly Cardano meetups, but we will do much more. We will provide meetup space for all crypto-projects (and sometimes beyond crypto). The Hub will work from early morning till night (and maybe even 24 hours in future) and crypto-enthusiasts and all visitors will be able to come, drink coffee, and to know more about Cardano. We will have unique library and unique bookshop - which will attract intellectual people, some of them can join crypto movement. We will create special technical meetups for developers (i.e. Haskell) and will try to achieve high-level developer acquisition for the Cardano ecosystem. We will have a media office there (already existing ones, Cryptotexty, which has sites in Ukrainian, English and youtube channel with 1k+ subscribers) and will provide working space for Cardano-related projects.

As an option - Cardano Hub can be tokenized, and have multiple owners and governance systems.

In fact, I think it should be tokenized or to find it's for-profit specialization, as I wouldn't be happy to run Hub on community donations.

Like Cardano is transferring from OBFT to SPO's making blocks, we will try to reach similar transfer in a year.

So I'm requesting 888 888 ADA which should be enough for 1 year of Cardano Hub functioning.","Cardano Hub - your key to the future.

**Overview**  

FOX Funds is a low cost smart contract based middleware platform that allows projects to be gifted funds by donations or using P2P trading and reward distribution.

The gifts are sent as either Fiat Currency (such as British Pound £ or American Dollar $ etc.) or Digital Currency (such as Bitcoin BTC, Ethereum ETH, Cardano ADA, Ripple XRP etc.) by users known in this document as FOX Gifters.

FOX Funds is aimed at the following:

*   One-off Activity - Donations / Fund Raising for a good cause, friend in need or a local event.
*   Project Fund Raising – software development start-up funds, personal project such as building an extension to my house for a child's playroom, charity funding etc.

*   This could be a one-off event or ongoing

There will be 3 ways to gift to a project:

*   Support via Staking
*   Donate Crypto Currency
*   Donate Fiat Currency

**FOX Gifters**

The FOX Gifter agrees to support a project financially for a length of time. The FOX Gifter may specifically choose a project, or a project is chosen on their behalf if they have delegated the gifting decision to someone else e.g. a stake pool or charity.

**Funding Process**

When a project is created the following happens:

Any gifted Fiat Currency to a project is immediately converted to a stable coin and made available to lenders so it earns interest (this should be a Cardano stable coin when available).

*   Any gifted Cryptocurrency to a project if not ADA is converted to ADA to undergo Staking.
*   Any gifted ADA to a project immediately undergoes staking.
*   If the user has chosen to gift their Cardano Staked rewards this should be directed to the project fund (note: only rewards go to the fund not the ADA that is being staked).

FOX Funds aims to return more value than donations would have done using traditional Fiat tender.

The owner of the project receives a market reward based on the value of the fund plus any additional rewards that were earned through staking and/or through lending.

**Funding Lifecycle**

1.  A new project is listed on the FOX Funds platform.
2.  Gifters can permanently gift Fiat or Digital Currency to the project.

1.  The gifts are borrowed and/or staked to earn interest.

4.  The FOX Gifter can also gift all or a percentage of the rewards they receive from staking ADA on a Cardano Staking Pool.

1.  The FOX Gifter can stop the staking rewards from going to the project at any time – note: the staked ADA is not given to the project, only the rewards.

6.  The project owner can withdraw their 'FOX Funds' according to the smart contract and the rewards created by the staking or lending will be divided according to the 'Project Funding Policy'.  
    

The owner of the project initially owns 100% of the ownership rights - this means they are entitled to 100% of the market rewards. The ownership rights can be transferred to single or multiple people and the market rewards will be distributed based on the ownership ratio.

**Donations**

Fiat Currency Donations are converted to a stable coin and interest is generated by borrowers who secure borrowing with digital assets. This will eventually be a Cardano stable coin.

When the project donation period ends (determined by the Project owners Smart Contract) the 'FOX Funds' borrowing is cancelled and interest gained through lending is released and the user can withdraw them.

**Staking**

Staking is used in 'FOX Funds' as a new payment system that enables rewards to be received for projects. Staking increases market rewards through the temporary deposit of ADA on a Cardano staking pool. The market rewards for staking are owned by the project owner(s) according to their ownership ratio.

When the staking period ends (determined by the project owners Smart Contract) the 'FOX Funds' staked in the project are released and the user can withdraw them.

The Staking pool is chosen at random or can be specifically chosen from a list of stake pools that are subscribed to the 'FOX Funds' platform.

**Stake Pools**

Stake pools that subscribe to the 'FOX Funds' platform will be given 'web integration code' so projects can be created, viewed and funded on their website.

Any projects created on the stake pools own website will automatically be staked to that pool (the option to change stake pool provider will be hidden)

The stake pool operator will gain the following benefits:

*   Great opportunity to increase the amount staked on their pool
*   Unique service to offer to their clients (people who stake)
*   Ability to attract new clients
*   Have an additional way to interact with their clients and have access to any emails/contacts created via their website

**Process Flow**

The following is a high level overview of the process.

(see attachment) 

**What does the current team look like?**

I have a small team of developers, testers and analysts at my disposal that have worked together on many projects. The current team is as follows:

**Rob Greig – CEO/CTO**

https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-greig-2076b053/

Rob is a serial entrepreneur, building businesses and developing software for 20 years in various industries. Highly skilled developer and Business Analyst. Previously built an estate agent monitoring system and an advanced automated backend/ cloud API business that was sold to one of the largest UK estate agent portals (Fish4) and media company 'Trinity Mirror'.

Excels in software planning, development, management along with building and mentoring small to medium development teams.

**Ant Renicks - COO**

Ant is a serial entrepreneur, building businesses and testing software for 20 years in various industries. Fully Trained software tester previously worked for large high street companies (Maginus/Torex Retail/PC World/Matalan) testing their in-store user systems. Was part of the same company that built Agent Analyser and House Fusion later sold to 'Trinity Mirror'.

**Dave Berner – Lead Developer**

Dave is a highly experienced and loyal web and API developer that has worked for small and large companies and worked with the original Rockstar Games (Grand Theft Auto). Energetic and a team player who loves to explore new technology.

**David Picksley – Developer**

David is a youthful experienced and loyal web developer that has worked for small and large companies and is trained in Salesforce CRM development.

**Callum Greig – Social Media Marketing**

Callum is a talented Photoshop and Video creator who has previously helped Luxury Car Showrooms build their Instagram followers from 0 to 300k in 3 months. With a keen eye for Photography and editing he is an asset to any team.

**Future Positions**

There are plans for more developers, analysts, admin, sales and marketing employees if larger funds became available and the project gained traction.

**What will the Cardano Funds be used for?**

I will use the Cardano funds to pay for the development of the main website and to begin the advertising/promoting of the site.

Ant and I will continue to bootstrap the project and will not take any wage for ourselves and contribute an additional £7,500 to the fund to go towards wages and other costs.

Having worked on the project plan more extensively I would require funding for 3 people for 6 months working out to be approximately 250,000 ADA

**Roadmap**

*   Build website to create projects
*   Partner with 1-3 stake pools
*   The reward options will be built up over time in the following order

*   Support via Staking
*   Donate Crypto Currency
*   Donate Fiat Currency

**What does success look like from Fund2?**

To have the main website and the 'Support via Staking' funding working.

Initially I would like to trial the system with a small number of stake pools then build to offering the system to them all.

I would like to have 100 projects created within the first 6 months before the large rollout happens.

**Future Funding and Enhancements**

I will need to update the website with feedback from the initial trials and start to build the remaining funding options, this would involve researching Fiat onboarding, Cardano stable coin and lending as these are not currently available.

As the system will not be generating income for the initial 6 months I foresee it would require more funding to continue the project.

I would like to build a large social media following via YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc. as this has worked very well to grow previous brands my team and myself have previously worked on.

**What value does FOX Funds bring to Cardano?**

FOX Funds is aimed at building on top of existing Cardano stake pool infrastructure and offering a new Use Case for Staking Pools.

It will encourage ADA to be staked and be locked up for periods of time, which is very positive for the price of ADA and encourages Stake Pools to promote their services.

The charity, donations and crowd sourcing project sector is extremely large worldwide and are always looking at new innovative ways to generate income. The Unique Selling point of FOX Funds is the donations should actually return more revenue than is pledged and be a great ambassador for Cardano.

The interaction with other Defi applications will also highlight to other developers the flexibility of the Cardano Platform, and the project funding will offer an easy entry point for developers to seek funding.","Collaboration with Stakepool owners to create a better solution to raising funds for personal events such as funerals, low income projects",I have been astonished at how much has been deducted by websites.

If the aim is to replace the economic systems of nation states, Cardano will need many campaigners and ambassadors – people who are invested ideologically, not just financially. We aim to broaden and deepen Cardano's ideological investment by empowering stakeholders to model pools after the future they want to create.

Cardano Stakepools are full of intelligent people with useful skills, that often care deeply about Cardano and are motivated to get involved, but don't see an easy way to do so in terms of developing the ecosystem. In my stakepool alone, of the first 10 people to join the telegram chat, three were developers offering to help and wanting to get involved. In the first week of the Catalyst program having put up this idea, I have attracted two more developers from the catalyst program as stakers to my pool as they too want to get involved with a pool that does something more.

If we create the tools for stakepool delegators to organise and leverage their collective intelligence, participating stakepools can evolve and self-incubate ideas. They can pool their own reward funds to invest in ideas and create pools that are more meaningful to them, rather than just somewhere to stake their ADA and earn rewards.

Having a diversity of Stakepools will help to distribute stake as it gravitates towards ideas people connect with. Right now, there is little but personalities (and soon performance metrics) to differentiate pools. There are some pools, like mine, that intend to give to charity or build dApps, but with little engagement from their stakers. It is also currently not feasible to verify that the charity spend will actually happen. However, if a pool wallet controlled by a delegator vote can be created, it would be possible for the delegators to decide when and how the charity wallet is spent.

I would like to see decentralisation all the way down – into the stakepools. Currently POS crypto ecosystems are built on stakepools that only serve as the base utility, but they can be so much more! In my opinion, if you assume that one day the world financial system will run on decentralised blockchain technology, the evolution of stakepools into such phenomena is inevitable. This idea highlights that and pushes it along faster.

Stakepools would be empowered to build all manner of services and evolve their own ""poolonomics"". For example, a pool may specialise as an investment focused pool. Which probably pays a higher pool tax % into pool wallets or smart contracts that funds long term investments in crypto, stocks, and physical world assets or tokenized versions. Maybe it employs a market analyst or a trade algorithm specialist. Maybe it has a trading wallet and stakers within the pool submit trade ideas in the form of smart contracts. An internal vote would occur, and a smart contract trade executed.

Another pool may use treasury funds to develop profitable companies that run on Cardano and return a royalty to the pool.

Another pool may evolve by artists who use their pool to advertise their works, maybe run a virtual gallery containing and selling NFT artworks.

Others may build an internal voting system and combine with other pools with specialist knowledge to form a human backed oracle service.

There are endless possibilities.

**HOW?**

To begin, there will need to be a minimal set of tools created for internal pool decision making and funds management. And additionally to create pool-roles (paid or unpaid). Along with a pool-plan/white-paper/meta data.

To start with, some simple additions to the Voltaire system such that votes can be instigated by the stakepool operator or stakers such that pool taxes can be collected into a pool treasury, roles within the pool can be created and filled, policies or a plan of action can be agreed on. Such as pool promotion, services, charity spend, etc.

I would also like to see DIDs be an option for use in identifying pool members as single individuals for votes and other poolonomic services.

It is important to keep in mind that stakepools are the backbone of the Cardano protocol, and changes at this level could have unforeseen consequences on the system. Therefore, we propose a creating a number of experimental pools.

**An initial roadmap:**

In the near future the idea will be made public along with offering KOALA pool and a few others to be DSO experiment pools. If these pools are successful in attracting stakers then a clear desire by the community to pursue this will be demonstrated.

If the idea proves appealing some funding will be sort from fund 2 to scope out the the initial software requirements, consider possible consequences, and facilitate pool members to collectively organise and incubate ideas. It may make sense to utilise ideascale for DSO incubation, with an alteration to allow for pool based groups and voting power being related to amount of stake in that particular pool.

Based on the fund 2 scoping work and pool based proposals/ideas from the individual experimental pools, a base set of on-chain software tools will be identified and agreed upon. Further funding would then be sort to build and roll-out such tools to the experimental DSOs.

This would then be followed by a period of assessment and refinement both in terms of the success of the pools, tools, incubation, and effects on the main chain.

  

**OTHER THOUGHTS**

If this proves successful, alongside the current ideascape process a pool based option would be available for operators or groups willing to participate. This could also create a market for stakepool operators to service a group/organisation with a pool based idea.  

It is my current expectation that the initial tools required to get started will be relatively easy addition to the Voltaire system, with some votes being limited to stakers within these experimental pools. It will also require multisig wallets or smart contracts to allow for decentralised control of funds relatively soon. There will also be a need to include a time-staked-with-pool component to the voting power due to the potential of large late timing stake vote attacks.

It may be wise to conduct this experiment on an additional side chain to replicant-chain?

This could be pursued as a third-party experiment and software, currently have about 6 developers standing by.

I think there would be some danger that this may cause to the Mainnet Cardano chain if this is developed as a third-party solution. But that is unclear at this time.

It is my opinion that this idea will have a significant impact on the fundamental nature of what stakepools will become in the crypto-verse. and if Cardano is the first crypto ecosystem to be able to offer this open involvement to all ADA holders, it will have a significant impact on the popularity and adoption of Cardano.

The DSOs themselves would be able to fund development of some of their pwn poolonomics, etc. from rewards, or volunteered time for status within the DSO, or may also apply for funding from the treasury.

In the longer term I believe stakepools will need a zone of sanctuary where they can be protected from other pool predatory behaviour, such as a large stake attack on a pool with a new idea, in order to destroy the internal voting and consume the idea for themselves. Or similar many small, seemingly disconnected, delegation basically an inter-pool sybil attack. I believe we will need a stakepool incubation sanctuary. Where pools can be helped and outfitted with tools and new tools developed if required by a new idea. Before being released into the ecosystem.

Users need to be able to opt in and opt out of organisations without leaving Cardano.,"I propose the building of a Cardano governance multiverse that supports an ecosystem of businesses and communities striving to function more efficiently. Once we can build such an ecosystem, new problems that require developer solutions will become more evident.

We should start by making it easy for communities and businesses to setup their organisations on a platform hosting a marketplace of organisations all with different causes and governance structures.

Creators should be able to choose the hierarchical structure, the voting rights and processes and how their members fund their own treasuries - whether it be by paying taxes, additional transaction fees, staking rewards or donations.

Cardano can add transparency to any organisations. Members of organisations would appreciate the ability to see how and when money is spent and the use of smart contracts to govern when and how funds are spent without the need to trust a middle man. Raising funds will be a lot easier on Cardano as automatic payments can be used. Decision making can be orderly and more effective because policy creation to implementation to review can be better designed and coordinated using the software.

Reputation, reviewing, personality and values matching will naturally emerge as useful and important features.

The possibility of creating startup businesses with strangers will become easier and less risky. We will be able to have fully transparent charities that are DAOs.

Nobody knows the best model for governance but the Cardano community will get to see many differently configured organisations running in parallel and we will more quickly be able to see what works and what ideas need more work.

Ultimately we should not try to create a one size fits all governance system and have projects that appeal to completely different types of people with completely different priorities competing unnaturally for treasury funds. Nobody will be satisfied. Let people find their internet tribes and start their own projects following their own strategies.

Further details

From what is currently on the market, my idea is closest to Aragon.

It will also borrow ideas from Bitnation, Colony and DOAstack.

The platform would emphasise the following:-

Ease of access - Users should be able to get started with a simple idea and through discussion with others build the idea into a fully operational organisation. Existing organisations should find it easy to onboard their organisation without being forced to change the way they run and manage their organisations.

Ease of use- The user experience should be simple with set-up wizards to start organisations according to their various kinds of configurations. Fundraising, Voting, Roles, Permissions, Management, Communication and Accounting should all be simple and user friendly.

Ease of individuals and organisations to collaborate - It should be easy for individuals and organisations to find similar or complementary organisations and individuals for, dialogue, collaboration or to form coalitions.

Measurement of individuals and organisations performance - A commons for analysis and creating different metrics for comparing and measuring the success and reputation of organisations and individuals.

Modularity - The software should be able to change, adapt and use plugins for new features that help improve the platform with tools for management, accounting , debating, profile features, matching users and communication.

Indepth advanced options - The platform should be completely agnostic when it comes to governance models. It should accommodate all possible tools and parameters so more advanced users can customise their perfect governing frameworks. User created governance frameworks should be savable, searched and utilised by others including less advanced users.

  

The Importance

A single governance system and treasury will likely be dominated by a few factions. Smaller factions will be squeezed out of the process and either become passive or will look elsewhere. Voter apathy leads to ideas such as paying voters to vote but voting is a privilege and paying voters undermines this fact.

Voters will not need to be paid if they consider the vote important and they are passionate about the issues. It is hard to be empathetic towards millions of people and the larger the group the more indifferent the voter.

As the number of participants grows the ability to discuss ideas will prove to be more difficult and decision making will suffer as all ideas will not be properly considered. This is not helped by making the vote proposals completely open ended. Without a narrow focus it will be hard to compare completely different ideas and we can only expect good ideas to get lost in the noise and more voter fatigue as voters struggle to prioritise, understand or connect to the issues.

There are many legitimate ideas and proposals that would be worthy of financial support. They can't all get support and gain funds as there is a limit to the number of winners possible and the dominant faction might continually see good causes as not worthy or as lower priority relative to others. If they are not picked up by the dominant factions they will get lost in the ocean of proposals until advocates don't bother making them anymore.

With a Cardano Organisation Multiverse, users could set up their own organisations, gain support and rally up their own funds from others passionate about their cause. Without such a platform many ideas simply will not get the light of day. It will lead to more apathy as users won't get a realistic chance to vote on the causes that are meaningful to them.

Also there is no one way to create a governance system and it is hard for a system to evolve without comparison or competition. With a multiverse of governance structures users can easily experiment and compare systems which will push improvement of the ecosystem forward.

Without the ability to design, create and promote our own organisation and treasury centered around causes we are most passionate about, Cardano will not be a system which allows maximum freedom.

General Overview

• Comprehensive First Principles study to understand the goals, needs and mechanics of the project to make it as adoptable, utilitarian and usable as possible

• Hire developer team to build out the platform

•Work in conjunction with established company ( www.thinkmechanical.com ) to test, refine and move company into a decentralized state and transition from a business to a platform

Details on the platform

• The platform needs to utilize the technology to connect the suppliers of materials, the trades/labour force and the consumers in a way where the labor force can make a fair living, and the consumers can trust that they are not getting hidden charges etc and the suppliers have a new revenue stream.

• We foresee the Prism app being the doorway upon where both consumers and laborers can broadcast their needs and and their abilities, ie, a plumber can broadcast his Journeyman ticket publicly and a potential client can see it based on geographical location and other metrics. (The plumber could broadcast his/her geographical working area)

• The app would have a rating system for both clients and laborers much like Google or Uber.

• Oracles could be built in conjunction with suppliers to continually update material costs and availability allowing material costs to be honest, and agreed upon as far as mark up etc.

• Utilizing smart contracts we can build and provide templates that would make the transactions as easily understood and actionable as possible

• Further iterations could decentralize the sales process and allow for commercial buildings, condo buildings, etc to have preventative maintenance programs that continually create requests for work while maintaining a minimum threshold for those who would do it; ie verified certifications, average rating by past clients etc. Whoever maintains those credentials could join the system and have access to pools of available jobs.

We believe that this is one of the greatest powers Cardano can bring to life, the ability to make a living without a boss.","Develop an Uber style platform for peer to peer skillset transactions, ie, plumbing, computer repair, lawn mowing etc.",Built an app from a sandbox program and implemented it within our own company; www.thinkmechanical.com to connect field techs company wide,

**Overview**  

'FOX Rewards' is a web based portal that encourages users to achieve goals and rewards them with points, level ups and cryptocurrency. The system will be free to the users and be as decentralised and open as possible.

The system is aiming to improve a person's Fitness, Mental Health & Mindfulness by gently providing goals for them to achieve. The system will integrate with various hardware devices and online libraries/tools.

Wellbeing effects everyone in their lifetime and there is a real urgent need to research and understand how people's mental state affects their lives, jobs and family.

Current software applications concentrate on one element of people's lives whether it's fitness, mental health or mindfulness. In truth we are all driven by different needs throughout our life and throughout the day. A fitness fanatic one day with Bi-polar can be crippled another day and there daily goal is not to walk an extra 1km, it's just to get out of bed and make it through the day.

The 'FOX Rewards' project will adapt to the day-to-day struggles and highs gently suggesting self-help where it can and encouraging general fitness when appropriate. Fitness is proved to be a great advocate in the fight to help mental health, but if the person cannot even face the postman how are they going to get the motivation to run a mile?

Lots of mental health issues are hidden and self-help is an amazing way to reach out.

'FOX Rewards' is aimed at the following:

*   Improve the personal fitness of a user of any ability
*   Improve Mental Health and offer resources to help self-healing
*   Improve Mindfulness via meditating and online community shared resources

The system will encourage an online community to build and share content and will offer initial self-healing to those who may be struggling from day-to-day life. It will also contain links and other help resources should situations escalate and the help of more professional services is required.

There will be many ways to earn rewards via the gamification style system such as:

*   Completing Daily Fitness tasks e.g. walk xx Miles, take xx Steps
*   Daily cumulative workouts
*   Listen to podcasts
*   POI Check-in
*   Watch mindful videos
*   Book and attend fitness courses
*   etc. 

***A simple daily starting questionnaire will decide the route of the application (see attachments)***

**Partnerships**

At the heart of the rewards will be partnerships with gyms, health clubs, sports facilities, local authorities, online resources, schools and others offering services within the 3 main core areas.

**Fitness**

Artificial Intelligence

The Fitness system will learn metrics from previous days and will gently encourage the user to increase their levels by a % per day. It will reward their effort and recalculate new targets each month.

**Courses**

Booking a fitness course will be rewarded along with attendance.

**Hardware & APIs**

The use of Fitness devices such as Fitbit will be encouraged as there are APIs that can be used to cut down the level of cheating that such an eco-system may find itself in. The automation of the results is key and there is already a working prototype that can connect and import the users Fitbit daily activity. The Fitbit API will also allow the full history of the user to be imported, allowing the system to have a great indication of their level and instantly reward the user for the previous 6 months activity.

There are plans to work with many other hardware devices and software API's such as Apple Fit, Google Fit, Strava etc.

**Places of Interest (POI) Check-in**

GPS will aid the check-in facility and this will be rewarded, examples of this could be a gym check-in or a point of interest such as walking to the top of a beauty spot.

**Rewards**

The main motivation for the user will be the rewards system and there will be multiple forms of rewards to encourage continuous use of the system:

*   Reward Points will be given to achieving goals
*   Level-Ups will be given by achieving point milestones
*   Cryptocurrency tokens will be given by achieving point milestones

The reward points can be redeemed within the e-commerce section of the system as follows:

*   Trade reward points for discounts of items in the shop
*   Trade reward points for discounts off fitness courses

**Mental Health**

The Mental Health aspect of the system will be treated very sensitively and we are aware not everyone has motivation to be fit when the help they require is often support. The professional and community self-help library will aim to offer initial support for people who need gentle encouragement, as well as offer insight into other areas that may help such as Fitness and/or Mindfulness.

There will be help and support for when situations are escalating and will encourage the user to reach out if things take a turn for the worse or thoughts are getting out of hand.

**Mindfulness**

Introducing a 5 minute meditation or podcast into the start or end of the day can really help to escape life's stresses or set you up in the right mind set to start the day.

For those lucky people with no mental health issues, the introduction to meditation and fitness goals could enrich their lives even more.

During the day a quick way to access resources that can help with panic attacks or racing minds can sometimes help to ease the mind.

In addition sleep can be improved for some people by getting into a regular habit of listening to a podcast and doing breathing exercises. These will be available in the professional and community based library.

**Medical Research**

Combining Fitness, Mental Health and Mindfulness together in one eco-system should be able to create interesting anonymous data studies to further enhance wellbeing studies.

**'FOX Rewards' Project Requirements**

The project requires the following:

*   Main Website

*   About Us, How To, Registration etc.

**Mind Map**

***The following is a high level mind map of the system (see attachment)***

 **What does the current team look like?**

I have a small team of developers, testers and analysts at my disposal that have worked together on many projects. The current team is as follows:

**Rob Greig – CEO/CTO**

https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-greig-2076b053/

Rob is a serial entrepreneur, building businesses and developing software for 20 years in various industries. Highly skilled developer and Business Analyst. Previously built an estate agent monitoring system and an advanced automated backend/cloud API business that was sold to one of the largest UK estate agent portals (Fish4) and media company 'Trinity Mirror'.

Excels in software planning, development, management along with building and mentoring small to medium development teams.

**Ant Renicks - COO**

Ant is a serial entrepreneur, building businesses and testing software for 20 years in various industries. Fully Trained software tester previously worked for large high street companies (Maginus/Torex Retail/PC World/Matalan) testing their in-store user systems. Was part of the same company that built Agent Analyser and House Fusion later sold to 'Trinity Mirror'.

**Dave Berner – Lead Developer**

Dave is a highly experienced and loyal web and API developer that has worked for small and large companies and worked with the original Rockstar Games (Grand Theft Auto). Energetic and a team player who loves to explore new technology.

**David Picksley – Developer**

David is a youthful experienced and loyal web developer that has worked for small and large companies and is trained in Salesforce CRM development.

**Callum Greig – Social Media Marketing**

Callum is a talented Photoshop and Video creator who has previously helped Luxury Car Showrooms build their Instagram followers from 0 to 300k in 3 months. With a keen eye for Photography and editing he is an asset to any team.

**Future Positions**

There are plans for more developers, analysts, admin, sales and marketing employees if larger funds became available and the project gained traction.

**What will the Cardano Funds be used for?**

I will use the Cardano funds to complete the development of the main website and to build the Minimal Viable Product which will then enable the system to be presented to potential partners/customers/investors

Ant and I will continue to bootstrap the project and will not take any wage for ourselves and contribute an additional £7,500 to the fund to go towards wages and other costs.

Having worked on the project plan more extensively I would require funding for 3 people for 6 months working out to be approximately 250,000 ADA.

**Roadmap**

*   Complete Fitness area of the website to complete the MVP
*   Partner with a number of gyms, health facilities and build the e-commerce shop for booking courses and offering products and discounts
*   Partner with a number of gyms and schools
*   The Mental Health and Mindfulness sections will be built following further funding of the system

**What does success look like from Fund2?**

To have the Fitness section of the main website and integration with Fitbit fully automated, and also to have the e-commerce shop working with a small number of partners.

Initially I would like to trial the system with a small number of partners then build to expand the system to their other branches/franchises.

I would like to have 5 gyms (or similar) on board within the first 6 months before the large rollout happens.

**Future Funding and Enhancements**

The website will be updated with feedback from the trials and start to build the remaining options.

The project is large and could grow quite rapidly after it has gained traction, but to begin with there is a large amount of development that is required so the project will need a larger investment for it to grow to its full potential.

I would like to build a large social media following via YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc. as this has worked very well in growing previous brands my team and I have worked on.

**What value does 'FOX Rewards' bring to Cardano?**

'FOX Rewards' offers a unique reward system and can be disruptive to the wellbeing sector.

The mathematical and scientific approach of Cardano shares the same values and fundamentals as my team and I. We want to associate our product with the Cardano brand and would hope Cardano in turn will want to associate with our product and brand for the same reason.

We are looking for a long term disruptive partner that can understand the vision we have and believe Cardano is the right company and block chain to align with.

We don't want our successful business to be built upon Ethereum for example - a block chain that could fail in a few years because the foundations they were built upon crumble, leaving us in an unstable position. Ethereum and others that were quick to market will be shown long-term to be playing catch-up with Cardano - we can't wait or take the chance on a project that is running 1000 miles down the track to try and change their engine mid-race.

The decentralised and community-led element of the 'FOX Rewards' eco-system will help the project to grow, and at every possible step we will shine the light of Cardano.

We hope 'FOX Rewards' will ultimately change people's lives forever and give them some hope and release from the crippling disease that is mental health.

The vast majority of people are sitting on the sidelines because they either don't know how to build out their own idea or they simply don't have any ideas themselves. If we can facilitate the cooperation of these two types of people, we could potentially bring in all of those individuals on the sidelines.The more people we have building the better. However, this won't just be a platform for finding developers; it will also be a platform for crowdsourcing problems through public posts. Example Posts:

*""Hey, I work with personal data and pay a lot per month to maintain it. I think blockchain could be a big boost. If you can figure out how to implement this, please reach out to me with your proposal on how to build it and how much money you would be willing to build it for. If I like your idea, we can start right away and you can work remotely!""*

*""Hey, I work with personal data and pay a lot per month to maintain it. I think blockchain could be a big boost. However, I'm struggling with (insert problem). I have 1,000 ADA in a smart contract with the ID 1234567 (so you can verify). The smart contract only allows the funds to go to a developer on this platform. If your solution works, the smart contract will send you the rewards. Please reach out with your proposed solution.""*

This model of crowdsourced problem solving has already been tested and has been extremely successful. InnoCentive is a platform that allows researchers to post their problems and the ""problem solvers"" (anyone) can propose a solution. If the solution gets picked, the problem solver gets paid a reward. InnoCentive boasts an 80% success rate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InnoCentive), compared to the 20% success rate of the internal research departments of pharmaceutical companies (https://www.innocentive.com/). Other platforms, like Quora and Slack, have very similar models and are also very successful. It is much easier to ask users what they need than to try to anticipate problems to solve. Cardano really needs the availability of this approach.

**Main Competitors:**

Platforms that match entrepreneur with developers already exist, however, none of them are built on a scalable blockchain. This simple fact is what will allow The Developer Marketplace to outcompete them. For example, the biggest competitor to this platform is UpWork. It is the largest free-lance marketplace in the world with 12 million free-lancers and 5 million entrepreneurs. Three million job posts are made annually with a combined worth of $1 billion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwork). There is very clear demand for this utility.

But depsite UpWork's impressive numbers, it has a fatal business flaw: it doesn't use blockchain as the backbone. This has a serious draw-back: UpWork is forced to use the legacy fiat system. This has two consequences. The first is that UpWork, while claiming to be a global platform, actually isn't global. The legacy fiat system doesn't actually reach every corner of the globe. It is still very difficult to get fiat into developing countries. The second consequence (and more important one) is that using the legacy fiat system forces UpWork to pay massive operational expenses in order to comply with the regulations such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and having reserves to handle delayed settlements. These regulatory expenses are arguably a significant part of UpWork's total budget. Because of these expenses, UpWork has to take a 20% cut from all jobs created through its platform. This is a steep barrier to entry for smaller developers.

By using Cardano as the backbone, The Developer Marketplace can utilize the money transfer mechanism of Cardano and its Prism utility for KYC. That means the Developer Marketplace would have a fraction of the expenses that UpWork and the other platforms currently have. The concept of the Developer Marketplace isn't new, using Cardano is simply a much better business model.

**The basics of how it would work:**

1\. In order to harness the anti-censorship of Cardano, the posts will need to be posted to the blockchain. The posts would be contained inside of smart contracts that can be removed (closed) when they expire. That means there will be a minimum transaction fee for posts, although a very small one. The dapp would use ADA for all payments.

2\. There will be two account types: entrepreneurs and dapp developers. Developer accounts will have a profile that describes their skills and experience (see #11). Both accounts will have contact information and user ratings associated with them (again, see #11). Eventually, Prism will handle the verifications of these profiles.

3\. When an entrepreneur makes a post, he will need to send the fee funds to a dedicated smart contract wallet. This smart contract will host the post for the duration of its lifespan. He can pay more than the designated minimum fee to make sure it is posted towards the top of the list on the platform (see #4). The people willing to pay more will usually align with how important the problem is (relative to the entrepreneur). That smart contract will immediately send a pre-defined portion to the platform's wallet. There will be enough left in the smart contract's wallet to pay for the closing of the contract when it is time (again, see #4). The platform's wallet will be used to pay operational costs.

4\. The platform will be a front-end website that queries all smart contracts of this type on the blockchain and will display the posts within them. The platform only needs to look back the past year, not the entire blockchain. The posts would be ordered based on recency and urgency. An example ranking algorithm is:

(2,592,000 - *t*) + ((*paid* - *mintee*)/5)(2,592,000 - *t*) = *VALUE*

Here *t* is time in seconds, *paid* is the actual amount paid, and the *minfee* is the minimum fee for posting from the platform. This fee will be higher than the minimum transaction fee on Cardano so that the platform can pay for operating expenses. The posts will be ordered from the highest *VALUE* to the lowest *VALUE*. This is exactly the way a developer would like to see them ordered. Once *VALUE* reaches zero, the post will be removed from the platform/blockchain. If a person pays just the minimum transaction fee, *VALUE* will reach zero in 30 days. For every 5 ADA paid above the minimum fee, another month is added to the post's lifespan in addition to an earlier position in the order.

6\. For job posts, there would at most be the lifetime of the post for developers to bid on a project (entrepreneurs can choose a bid before the time is up and ignore all others). The fact that the post is no longer available stops new developers from finding it and bidding. The entrepreneur picks what she thinks is the best bid and either hires the developer and starts the endeavor or she collaborates with the developer on a treasury proposal for funds.

7\. For crowdsourced problems like in the second post, the 1,000 ADA would be deposited into a smart contract. If nobody submits a response by the time the post expires (which will be a pre-defined time), the deposit is returned to the originating wallet and the contract would close. This is the only scenario where funds are returned to the originating wallet. If developers do submit answers, the poster selects the developer with the most useful answer and the smart contract sends a small percentage to the platform's wallet and then the rest of the ADA to the selected developer's wallet. To dis-incentivize the poster from trying to recover the funds by waiting out the post, the smart contract will know how many developers answered the post. If more than zero developers (so any) answer the post and the time runs out, the smart contract sends the funds to the platform's wallet instead. In addition, the user who posted the problem will have his account tagged so that other users can see that he did not reward the solution. This will allow the crowd to police the crowdsourcing so that it stays honest and effective. Solved posts will remain on the blockchain (or server) so that future people with the same problem can reference the solution.

8\. If someone posts a crowdsourced problem that they believe is novel but other people do not, developers can mark this post as ""not novel"" and point the questioner to the original. If enough developers mark the post as ""not novel"" (3-5 might be enough), the post could be taken down from the blockchain; the smart contract can do this itself.

9\. In the case that an entrepreneur has a confidential project proposal in mind, they can reach out to developers directly instead of publicly posting the idea to the blockchain. In addition++, the entrepreneur can pay an additional fee to get access to an NDA feature that can be stored (encrypted) on the blockchain.++

10\. When posts are made, the poster can tag it with labels such as: web design, server security, blockchain integration, etc. Then developers can search for key words that would get matched against the words used by entrepreneurs to tag their posts. This would be more fair than having pre-defined tags. This makes it easier for a security developer to find work as compared to having to look through all 10,000 posts. The posts would still be sorted from highest to lowest *VALUE*.

11\. The developers' accounts will have user ratings (similar to Amazon Seller). This allows the developers to build up their reputation. ++No degrees or certifications will be required for developers but there will be a place dedicated to them in the profile.++ Due to the way the platform works, developers only get paid if they solve a problem or win a bid by having a good plan. Non-certified developers can have good ideas, too. This is a self-reinforcing meritocracy. In fact, a developer with a degree can deliberately charge a little more on her bid because she is a less risky employee than a developer without a degree. It would then be up to the entrepreneur to spend more for a developer with a degree or spend less and take the risk with a developer without a degree. ++Entrepreneurs can decide for themselves if a certification matters.++ Eventualy, ++Prism will be used to verify all degrees and certificates declared.++

12\. The platform will not enforce any problem or bid format. If an entrepreneur posts a poorly worded problem, the bids they recieve will reflect that. Then if they go ahead with one of the bids, the endeavor will likely fail resulting in a loss for the entrepreneur. This is already enough of an incentive for an entrepreneur to explain the problem well. Likewise, if a bid is poorly explained, the bidder will likely not get hired. The desire to have an income is enough of an incentive for bidders to submit quality bids. Any filter the platform enforces will create a centralized bottleneck. It is better to let the market do the enforcing.

13\. ++The platform will not be responsible for deciding when a developer deserves to get paid.++ The platform is only meant to connect entrepreneurs with developers. The rest of the business is meant to be conducted off the platform. However, ++the user ratings for both accounts are there to enforce good cooperation.++ For example, if an entrepreneur refuses to pay the developer for her work, she can explain the situation on the entrepreneur's rating. Thus, even though she may not be made whole, other developers can know to stay away from that entrepreneur. In other words, users can get ostracized by the community for bad behavior. This is another situation where the community can police itself. Prism verification can be used to prevent an ostracized member from creating a new account under a different name.

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP):**

1\. A basic web domain with the two account types.

2\. Smart Contract posting to the blockchain and reading the posts on the smart contracts.

**Sources of Revenue:**

1\. ++Extra Fee per Post++: above what the Cardano transaction fee is. This extra fee can be very small due to how cheap it is to post to Cardano. The Urgency amount paid will automatically go to the platform.

2\. ++Money Back Guarantee:++ When a crowdsourcing problem is posted to the platform, a cut of the payout could go to the platform for paying operational costs. So in the 1,000 ADA example, the platform could take 10% and the rest goes to the developer with the best response. This could be true even if the funds are going to Cardano's treasury. In the case that no body responds, the poster would still get the full deposit back. This would require a lot of crowdsourcing for the cashflow to be meaningful.

3\. ++Stake Pool Delegation (Not Required):++ Delegating to the platform's pool would be like receiving donations. Any one would be able to use the platform even if they don't pay. The use of the money would be transparent. This probably won't be a meaningful amount until there are a few tens of thousands of users.

4\. ++Non-used funds in the platform's wallet can be delegated++.

**Roadmap:**

++Pre-Release++

Stage 1 (2-3 months): Hire either Emurgo or IOHK developers to build the basic web domain with the two accounts.

Stage 2 (2-3 months): Build the smart contract functionality. **By partnering with IOHK or Emurgo, this platform can be released with Gougen.**

++Post-Release++

Stage 3 (2-3 months): Strategic marketing to Haskell and plutus developers as well as entrepreneurs in the community.

Stage 4 (2-3 months): Digital NDA functionality added and marketing to developers for other blockchains (Cardano benefits either way).

Stage 5 (3-6 months): Heavy marketing to entrepreneurs and developers on other platforms (like UpWork). This requires easy conversion between ADA and fiat (or goods), otherwise this will cause friction for adopting the platform.

(See Marketing Strategy below for more details.)

**3 Year Budget - $250k:** Some things are deliberately over-estimated; the prices are in USD but the equivalent will be paid in ADA when possible

1\. 2 developers (who double as support in the beginning) at $70,000/yr = $140,000/yr paid in ADA

2\. Upfront Cost of Website = at most $10,000 paid in USD

3\. Monthly Cost of Website

\-----1. Dedicated Server Hardware = $700/month = $8,400/yr paid in USD

\-----2. Domain Name (separate from server host) = $15/yr paid in USD

\-----3. SSL Certificates = $500/yr paid in USD

4\. Security and Backup Features (not just on server)= $5,000/yr paid in both USD and ADA

5\. Strategic Marketing = $20,000/yr paid in both USD and ADA

Sub-Total per Year = $183,915 -----keep reading to see why this being a large chunk is actually not an issue

Immediately upon receiving funds (I am assuming the funds are in ADA), $70k will be converted to USD. The remainder will be delegated to provide an extra source of cashflow and possibly benefit form ADA's price appreciation. ADA's price will likely only collapse if the world experiences a Global Depression. However, the governments and central banks are trying to do everything to keep inflation going. This makes the most likely scenario that of stagflation (if not hyperinflation). By having the long-term funds in ADA, its purchasing power can be protected, if not increased. The funds will be converted to USD as needed. Doing this, the initial $250k can likely be stretched to $350k-$400k.

++By the end of the first year, we should have 4 sources of cashflow++: the extra fees, the money back guarantee, the non-required stake pool, and the delegated start-up funds. This should be enough for the platform to scrape by for the next few years ++with the remaining $70k (the initial $250k minus the Sub-Total per Year) as a cushion.++

**Marketing Strategy:**

++Stage 3 - of Roadmap++

1\. No marketing will be done until after the platform is released with Gougen.

2\. After the release, marketing will be targeted to Haskell developers (since Plutus is basically Haskell).

Developing a decentralized platform to pose discoveries found in the scientific literature and evaluate their potential, with contributions of all relevant players, will accelerate the development of breakthrough technologies.

The proposers are Alejandro Boscoboinik (University of Wisconsin Milwaukee), Anibal Boscoboinik (www.boscoboinik.com, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5090-7079), Octavio Furlong (Universidad Nacional de San Luis, Argentina) but we obviously need a lot more people to join us for this to work. We especially need developers (we are scientists) to even think of getting started.

We have the science part covered to some extent, through our experience and our network, but we really need the involvement of programmers, engineers, technologists, business people, creative minds, and Jules Verne's of today.

++**MAIN IDEA: Translation of Science to new Technologies**++

++We propose to develop a platform where all the involved people contribute to the process of **translating bodies of research into new technologies.**++

++There are different ways of materializing this idea. The process proposed below is one of them:++  

\--------------

Step 1: People (it can be participating scientists but not necessarily) provide a summary of research they think has the potential for aiding in the development of new technology and links to related publications.  

Step 2: A discussion takes place within the broad community in the platform to evaluate the potential of this presented research.

Step 3: If consensus is achieved between the participants that there is a real potential, a business plan is developed by the interested parties. If not, the research is shelved but available in case anyone wants to revisit the discussion in the future.

Step 4: The business plan is further evaluated by the involved parties, if consensus is achieved that the plan makes \*economic sense, then the plan moves forward to be evaluated for \*\*funding.

\*Economic sense is not necessarily monetary, it could be a technology that does not generate monetary profit but it provides a greater good such as reducing poverty, reducing contamination, reducing global warming, add value to the ecosystem/Cardano, etc.

\*\*A Fund needs to be generated to start the system, potentially a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), but the system will be sustainable if a percentage of the profit from the developed technologies goes back to Fund.

Step 5: If funding is approved, a team is assembled to execute the idea. This will involve registering a business and hiring people as needed. A plan with milestones upon which disbursement of funding is contingent is developed. This plan also needs to be discussed, evaluated, and approved.

\------------------

Starting this project requires people within the blockchain space, and with the potential long term vision of reaching beyond. A potential flow process of the platform was introduced in the previous section and could be first tested on a small scale. The first group needed to be involved in this is that of developers to code the idea. DEVELOPERS WANTED!!  

++**ANCILLARY IDEA: decentralized open-access peer-reviewer scientific journals**++

A branching idea that will be part of this project relates to easier access to research by developing decentralized open-access peer-reviewed scientific journals. The articles in these journals will be dynamic in nature and contributors will have the ability to add discussions and modifications as new insights are gained over time. Non-technical summaries suitable for a general public readership will be also required in addition to the main technical paper. This is in contrast to current peer-reviewed scientific articles that have three main problems: 1 they are hard for the wider community to get access to (expensive subscriptions), 2. they are hard for the general public, or even scientists for other disciplines, to understand due to the jargon of specific communities, 3. they are static in nature after their official publication.

++Other ideas:++

Easier access to published research is needed. In the US, taxpayer-funded research (national labs and government-funded research in general, which is most of it) is open in principle but one has to play tricks to find the information. It is usually posted in not-easy-to-find repositories. Having an AI platform to search through these repositories and organizes the information in an easily searchable way would be another great spin-off of this project. Here's an example of one such source of publications from the US: https://www.osti.gov/search-tools . This is not just for publications, but also for patents, code, etc, funded by the US government.

So, easier access to information is one of the problems. The second one is the jargon used, many people would not understand what the authors want to say because it is written in a jargon that a very small community can understand, and not necessarily the people that have the problem to be solved. It all goes back to communication and building the bridges so that what is written in those articles could be translated to the people for which that research is useful.

These ancillary ideas will contribute to facilitating that the **Dscience to Dtech platform** runs more smoothly by enhancing the access to scientific research, and improving the communication between all the relevant parties involved in the evaluation of the potential of research findings to lead to new technologies.

We want to emphasize that, while initial funding is required to (a) develop the platform and (b) to fund the ""*first science to tech translations""*, the long-term goal is that the system is self-sustained by keeping a percentage of the profits from the new technologies available to fund new potential translations of scientific research to new technologies.","To identify scientific discoveries that can lead to meaningful technologies, and democratically vet their potential for breakthroughs.","We are scientists with doctoral degrees who have identified that most research, which could lead to a breakthrough tech, goes unnoticed.",

WeThinkItMatters

Problem:

for Businesses, the problem is click fraud and even if people are the ones clicking the ADs they are not really engaged and connecting with most people.

for Nonprofits, the problem is you can't hardly spend money on ADs but you still have to compete for the same consumer dollars that businesses are spending over $500+ billion to influence people.

for People, the problem is they already give 15X times more money to Nonprofits than Businesses each year, and their attention is valuable but they don't get anything for it.

Solution:

Develop a PaaS where Businesses, Nonprofits, and People get better Return on Investment from money spent on advertising. WeThinkItMatters is a Member(People) owned media platform that offers Businesses 3X times the impressions for the same cost per click, and 60% of the total AD spend of Businesses goes to Nonprofit Partners, and 10% to Members. WeThinkItMatters offers anyone in the world the same value for their engagement and guarantees a Business they are connecting with real people and getting amazing ROI.

Relevant Experience:

I have been a recipient of charitable deeds most of my life, one of the most memorable was being a Make-a-Wish Kid. Later on in life as an adult I started a nonprofit who's mission was to Party for a Purpose. Really at the time it was me trying to stay in a party lifestyle and feel better about the money I was wasting, but the idea was event and drink sales would go to send kids on Make-a-Wish trips. Starting a nonprofit opened my eyes to the challenges nonprofits face in the marketplace, especially when it comes to marketing and trying to get peoples attention without spending money. And 9 years ago I started up a For-Profit company with the purpose of raising billions for charities through a cause-integrated marketing platform called WeThinkItMatters. I have been in the startup trenches ever since covered in blood, sweat, and tears trying to startup and working to bring this platform to market. I am not expert or scholar but when I get knocked down I always get back up again, hopefully wiser from the experience.

Plan:

Hire a team to take the current MVP and new workflows (PLEASE SEE ATTACHMENT) and create WTIM on Cardano's blockchain. Work with https://www.investorintelligence.io/ and https://netcapital.com/ to raise more capital for hiring my team members across all departments of the company. Work with Techsoup to let their 1+ million nonprofit partners know there is new fundraising tool for them to use for FREE!

Funds Requested:

1,000,000 ADA

In thinking about this funding request, I recognize that I do not have a reputation to back my plans. Of course, I'd love to ask for 6 or 12 months of runway. For the sake of our shared Fund 1 experiment, I am requesting a total of $10,000 USD to support my first two months of work. During these two months I'll build a reputation and the scaffolding to ask for more in an upcoming funding round, at which point I will make a proposal to grow the team and to fund further development work.  Related to this approach, please see the ""Release of Funding"" proposal I have submitted under the ""Improve Catalyst"" challenge.","Workshop Maybe is a community-centered organization driving Cardano adoption via open-source experiential learning. Our work and value proposition is centered on three goals:  

*   Developing a framework for open source, experiential learning that will support aspiring developers and business owners to build with Cardano.
*   Cultivating an example of local, community-based Cardano education and adoption that will provide a place to test new ideas and to learn what works best.
*   Contribute to building a platform for global community members to share open source learning resources in order to simplify on-ramps to the Cardano ecosystem.

I am preparing open source ""starter kits"" that consist of a combination of smart contract code, voting apparatus, guided learning materials, and implementation tips. Starter kits will support new users to learn about Cardano while also producing some real-world outcome, and will vary in complexity, for everyone from beginners to experts. It may be a good idea to combine this idea with some sort of education/training credentialing system.

Starter kits will not be ""grab and go"". Users will commit to learning about how smart contracts and voting work on the Cardano platform. For one example, a beginner-level pack might involve a fundraiser in which stickers or t-shirts are sold, with a few artists submitting designs that are voted on by a community. The learner-entrepreneur using the resources would have to open the smart contract code to tweak different parameters such as the price of participation, the cost of each item, the reward for a winning designer, the proportion of funds going to some cause, and more. Keep in mind this is just one example. The idea is to create a platform for sharing a variety of use cases, and to build a project-based education platform in which the ""curriculum"" might consist of one or more starter kits, pre-requisite skills, and community support. An expert-level starter pack might involve city-wide event planning and the community funding of small businesses, and my agenda is to build to the point where big projects like this are possible.

I am launching Workshop Maybe on the belief that Cardano is the platform best suited to fulfill the long-term promise of introducing blockchain use cases to mainstream users. My goal is that as many people as possible understand the new opportunities opened up by Cardano. We will draw connections between local engagement and ecosystem-wide development work, and it is a responsibility of this project to demonstrate how bottom-up movements can work alongside large-scale global efforts. We will work to ignite the public imagination about what is possible on the Cardano platform through highly accessible, understandable use cases, especially those that foster community engagement and improvement. Even for non-developers, when these projects are implemented locally, we want to get people to ask, ""How did you do that? Can you tell me more?""?
