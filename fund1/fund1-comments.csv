10/Dec/20 9:58 PM,317191,183,paulmullins,Is anyone here familiar with https://cryptochicks.ca/ . They are a non profit organization that runs blockchain hackathons where only women can participate. I actually mentored at their first hackathon helping teams connect their web apps to the blockchain. If you need guests for your podcast the founders would be a great place to start. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if CryptoChicks as an organization would be able to fund you.,NO

06/Oct/20 1:07 PM,317191,183,Charlie,"I like the initiative of these women to create a podcast about women in crypto/blockchain. What I do not or less like is the title of this podcast ""The Women Effect"", for example; transfer yourself in a (young)women at scool and you see the name of this podcast what do you think?, it's the first impression that counts. This (young)women will not know what it's about at first impression when she read this name. I think the title needs more identity regarding Cardano, block-chain or crypto.

Also I do not think that this podcast is a pure women or political statement, it's about the awaireness of women who also can participate in blockchain or crypto. Cardano is about the financial independency of every human. There are a lot of women who are depended of a man in the thirth world countrys but also in the western world. This podcast will make some changes and awaireness at that level I am sure of that.",NO
05/Oct/20 11:33 AM,317191,183,Michael,@devprior  Excellent reply but if you are any older than 15 you realized that females live on a recruit difficulty and they expect to get money just because they are females.,NO
03/Oct/20 1:09 PM,317191,183,shwetachauhan2008,"There are a couple of things that we need to understand here.

Women are different from men in the aspect that men create space for themselves while women need invitation to come in a space.

This is not gender politics. It is a clear fact that women are less in blockchain so we need to promote them.

Having said that in our new proposal we have included a male developer so it clearly shows that we are not against men.

Hope this answers your thoughts!",NO

02/Oct/20 10:17 PM,317191,183,Community Member,I'd like to see gender politics stay out of the space as much as possible. We don't need to create gender specific content. Men tend to be more thing oriented and women tend to be more people oriented which is why you have more men in the space. I'm tired of seeing this angle used to promote certain people with the space. We have enough podcasts without making identity politics based ones on top of it.,NO
02/Oct/20 1:17 PM,317191,183,Todsy,"Hi,

I really like the concept of having competing education platforms and really like the proposal - more detailed than others.

Just going to layout couple of my questions here.

1) One thing I am conscious of is that there is a 6 months of funding allocated in the budget with 1 month of content laid out of detail - perhaps it would be clearer if you could drill down on what the plan is for the additional 5 months. Just from a very high level, maybe you're planning a monthly theme... per video / blog post etc?

2) Also, if it is worthwhile providing videos on generally what is blockchain, what are smart contracts then build up on how Cardano leverages these concepts and ideas. Is this something the platform could cater for or will the plaform focus purely on use cases?

3) Will the videos follow the same pattern as something like Cardano effect with asking questions etc, or will it be more of a direct content on how to use Plutus playground / building your first Dapp/ Smart Contract/ Stake pool etc..

I'm just trying to understand who the main community target here is.. bringing new stake pool ops, devs, or the general population?

Thanks.

Love the work and content you and your peers are doing and have done in bringing greater awareness to Cardano

This video came up and expresses a challenge i have been having with trying to decide how to vote, just wondered if this could work for you and others as a way forward, i will try and find the other proposals and post the same message, maybe worth starting a dialogue, it also promotes de-centralised content production, brought together for the benefit of the community !!!

01/Oct/20 3:11 PM,317074,175,lkbh,"Although both Sabih and DevPrior have their arguments and they are valid, I have a question to both of you. If these videos/podcasts attracts new generation of developers and they in turn contribute to the growth of the cardano ecosystem, is he getting benefitted from that ?

in other words can we as a community work together to create a platform that integrates the different media platforms and have a unified way to reward the content creators for the work they are doing. And not just immediate reward but a cascading one. So if some developers/marketing/adoptors use the channel to come and join the cardano community and be part of the network expansion, these content creator should also benefit in some way via ADA.

  

THAT IS THE LARGER QUESTION WE SHOULD ADDRESS INSTEAD OF BEING FOCUSSED ON NARROW GAINS/LOSSES",NO
01/Oct/20 9:32 AM,317000,166,don,Totally waste of the funds money on this podcast. Sorry do it for free to push your stake pool or do an idea for dev an Dapp or other Code benefit. Not talking the funds money away,NO
01/Oct/20 9:30 AM,317191,183,don,@devprior  yes i totally agree. way too much podcasts here ripping the fund off. it should be for devs and great Dapps ideas. not waste on some people talking an hour,NO

I would be happy if Maria's proposal will be supported, as she is a good educator. Moreover she speaks Portuguese, and that's good for additional outreach and bringing new people to Cardano.

Like I replied to Sabih - the idea to submit Podcast proposals came from Charles Hoskinson. He encouraged people to apply, and there are many other submissions.

But you also need to consider that it took a long long time for those popular youtube channels to gain traction and influence. And part of our mission in mass awareness and adoption of Cardano in 6 months and podcasting is a very powerful marketing tactic. So in effect proposals seeking funds for producing shows last will live forever advertising Cardano on Youtube, that is a decent ROI from the funding. These podcasts can inform people about blockchain, help them understand why Cardano is a good choice, and be educating people longterm even after the funding stops.

I agree that we should not just throw money at any proposal seeking to create a podcast, but finding ones to support that produce great content is well worth the ADA. Getting people's attention costs a lot of money and brands spend millions on 30sec TV spots to just be seen and talked about. So why not use some dcfunds to support passionate community members that want to promote Cardano:)",NO

25/Sep/20 7:05 PM,317000,166,Dev Prior,"@boonetb  @tevosaks  There are already a myriad of these shows/podcasts in existence with considerable viewerships. We do not need to spend community money on this. These other shows have found success on their own merit, and they didn't wait for a community fund to dip their fingers into to get started. If a show has good content, it finds viewers, if it finds viewers the quality of the channel and content naturally improves with time.

I get that a lot of people on here are ""friends"" with some of the people submitting these ideas and want to support them, but by doing so you're not really adding as much value to the ecosystem as you would be by giving that money to someone who is actually building on Cardano.

Charles' word is not law, and just because he wants there to be more shows about Cardano, doesn't mean there aren't significantly better ways to spend that money that will achieve far more than another youtube channel or discussion video. If he wants more shows he can create his own personal ideascale project and fund it out of his own pocket and leave treasury funds alone.

If you want to pay someone to talk about Cardano be my guest, but it is without a doubt a waste/misappropriation of community funds when there are a lot of shows finding success without our money.",NO
25/Sep/20 6:13 PM,317000,166,Boone Bergsma,"@devprior  CH asked for 3 types of podcast and offered matching funds up to $15k winners of dcfunds. So, I don't think your comment is helpful. It takes people's time and money to produce podcasts, and providing some to help with production will only help those making them do a better job. It is by these types of videos that people learn about Cardano and decide to buy ADA or not, and we want more people to buy ADA so the price goes up :)",NO

Thank you for your submission.

This looks great. I have to congratulate you as only few proposals have had a good understanding of how they can spend the money. I am very excited to have read and see actual numbers like you have presented.

I would only add to put some measurable goals that you can benchmark against. How to judge the success. What your target of subscribers is, views, etc.  
  

*How to judge our success:*

*Every month we will deliver a report stating the following:*

*1\. Send of a spreadsheet with the work delivered with data as below*

*3\. Views per video of ""Women Effect""*

They do have exchanges and Bitcoin atms there but dont have easy 2 way access like they have in Europe where they can withdraw $20000 per day with out KYC. Not that KYC is a problem for many of them, although some do have credible ID issues.

Basically what's needed in the Philippines is a place they can go to and show some id or give a secret number and grab the cash to gitsum food. The 711 shops there would be a good place for them to be able to do this if they were not picking up a large sum of money. I am sure Union Bank would be happy to assist Cardano with exposure if they were approached by someone who could make it happen

Obviously in the ideal world this would be much better if anyone could use these services weather they have a bank account at the UNIONBANK in the Philippines or not. Many people do not have a bank account and it is a privilege to have one there, if they are able to keep the account open. Western union is by far the way money is mostly sent to the Philippines.

How to Sell Anything to the Masses?

The less you seem to be selling something- the better...make your approach soft, seductive, and insidious.

SOFT: be indirect...Create news and events for the media to pick up, spreading your name in a way that seems spontaneous, not hard or calculated.

SEDUCTIVE: keep it entertaining...Your name and image are bathed in positive associations; you are selling pleasure and promise.

INSIDIOUS: aim at the unconscious, using images that linger in the mind, placing your message in the visuals...

...Appear as news, never as publicity...People pay more attention to what is broadcast as news- it seems more real. You suddenly stand out from everything else, if only for a moment- but that moment has more credibility than hours of advertising time. The key is to orchestrate the details thoroughly, creating a story with dramatic impact and movement, tension and resolution...

Aim for the heart, not the head. Design your words and images to stir basic emotions. Similarly, find ways to surround yourself with emotional magnets- well known people...Pay more attention to the form of your message than to the content. Images are more seductive than words, and visuals- soothing colors, appropriate backdrop, the suggestion of speed or movement- should actually be your real message. The audience may focus superficially on the content, but they are really absorbing the visuals, which get under their skin and stay there longer than any words.They should make people feel happy or sad...Remember: images linger in the mind long after words are forgotten. The key is learning to express your message through visuals that insinuate positive emotions and happy feelings...

... people want to be entertained, they suspend their disbelief for a while and imagine that the magic is real...The public has a weakness for what seems both realistic and slightly fantastical- for real events with a cinematic edge... Make your events and publicity stunts plausible and somewhat realistic, but make their colors a little brighter than usual, the characters larger than life, the drama higher. You are creating a confluence of real life and fiction- the essence of any seduction.",NO

I think we are all looking at this from different angles, and some the same.  
  
What I am trying to do with the real estate business(LLC) and blockchain tech is focused around building a holding company that owns and develops real estate. And offers anyone in the world to invest with us by ether being a lender or asset holder or both with as little as $10(fiat or crypto).  
  
I will probably launch this on ETH in the next 3 weeks. And then when it is possible use the ERC20 Converter to migrate to ADA :D  
  
For the early stages of this, the LLC will probably only invest in the USA and focus on my region to start. It is not hard to buy property in most places as a business. And to start we are not trying to move the transaction process onto the blockchain. All I want to do at this point is make it easy for people to invest in real estate easily, securely, and successfully as possible by the Tokenization of assets and loans.",NO

Once the process is established for each jurisdiction, then it will be easier to onboard and manage those assets.

Impact - How do you think this proposal can better address the challenge: How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months? : Our workshops are reaching and bringing in Haskell developers that have no experience with Plutus and Marlowe and having them learn it building something for entrepreneurs who want to start businesses on Cardano. Our workshops pay Haskell developers to learn Plutus and Marlowe and what is being paid to the DEVS is being invested in building Dapps for entrepreneurs who are dreaming about starting businesses. At ADA MakerSpace Haskell DEVs will get hands on paid learning experiences and entrepreneurs will get Dapps built that they may have not been able to fund or created themselves. ADA MakerSpace will be free to watch and lucky entrepreneurs who are tuning-in and completing bounties can get their ideas built by ADA MarkerSpace. And those that can afford development can sponsor an episode/s creating funding for the podcast and incubation of ideas built on Cardano. Last Edited by You 18/Aug/20 2:45 PM 3\\.  

Feasibility - What are ways in which this proposal's budget, plan, scope or team can be modified to make it more likely for the proposal to be successfully implemented? : The proposal is already pretty successfully implemented. With the MVP website and the first lesson already scheduled and funded this proposal is a Proof of Concept already it just needs support from Cardano, Emurgo, and IOHK. But if it relies on the Team members to put in all the time, money, and energy to launch and maintain it until fund2 funding is given out, then its reach and impact will be limited. And all stakeholders in ADA will be missing a huge opportunity. It will cost $2400 to pay DEVs to learn and teach 8 episodes, and a few hundred in operating cost for the 2 months for the Team to support this themselves without making anything. But then the team would have to be stressed out about investing effort into creating a high-quality podcast and promoting it while having to spend time making money for living expenses by putting the most effort into something else that probably not helping Cardano get more DEVS and Entrepreneurs into the ecosystem.

""The Reach programming language is a high-level DApp language that outputs the entire dApp, not just the smart contract"". The team has already deployed on Ethereum + Algorand and looking at their Github repo (~70% in Haskell) this team loves Plutus/Marlowe they just dont know it yet :wink:

I also highlighted the active Cardano Foundation RFP calling for additional smart contract languages on Cardano. It seems Reach would be an ideal candidate for funding here as well.

18/Aug/20 2:37 PM,316860,157,shapiro21,"@liqwid.labs  The logic has to do with how all of the competitors work. For example, UpWork is the biggest competitor and it uses the legacy fiat system to move the money from the entrepreneur to the free-lancer. In addition, they store everything on the server. Imagine what the regulatory costs and requirements are for using the fiat system: the needed man power, the fees, etc. This has to be a huge expense. If Cardano was used as the payment channel instead, that expense simply wouldn't exist. And by storing what we can on the blockchain, we also don't need that much server space. These are arguably the biggest expenses that a platfom like UpWork would have. (I am including the necessary man power to maintain the fiat system and servers in this statement).  

I totally agree with the bounty program. That could be a good jump starter for adoption.

To you second paragraph: Okay so the way I envision integrating this into a Dev marketplace would be with a bounty attached for successfully bringing a product to MN in a given timeline meeting specific KPI's/metrics. Profitability of the Dev Marketplace matters much less imho when you are directly attaching economic incentives to these product requests. I also see this as a massive way to bootstrap Cardano dev ecosystems globally not just on the marketplace/Cardano Dev Hub. Ideas like @jaycidiq  to setup a Cardano Dev Training Center would massively benefit from having developer product bounties attached to specific defi products we want introduced to the community. This is basically how defi focused hackothons in ethereum work today, the EF/Consensys selects a specific product category and all devs compete for funds building MVP's over a 2-3 day period.

I don't know if you viewed the attached WTIM Smart AD Contract PDF, PDF attachments get kinda lost and overlooked in ideascapes layout. But the incentives for a business to spend advertising dollars on a WeThinkItMatters Campaign are multiple.

1\. Advertisers get 3 times more impressions from a CPA (Cost Per Action) than they get on any other media in the industry, and for a lower CPA cost than the industry standard. So it cost less and provides 3x times the engagement compared to anything on the market.

2\. Advertisers get guaranteed that 60% of whatever they spend will be benefiting charities and making a positive impact in our global communities. So they could spend $1 with our competitors and have $0 do anything good for their employees and customers, or they could spend $1 with WTIM and know $.60 went to make a difference.

3\. Advertisers get guaranteed that 10% of whatever they spend will go those they are engaging with. So if they advertise with our competitors(all but a few) and spend $1 most of the time $0 is going to the person they are advertising to. With WTIM $.10 of every $1 spent on WTIM goes to lotteries Voting Members can win.

As for the $10k beta sold two years ago. It was built by a self-taught wanna be developer and was mostly smoke and mirrors with no real backend functionality. Also, there was no onboarding tools to help the advertiser and partnering nonprofits understand how to get the most from the campaign.

I could make it last 2-3 years which should be enough time to get enough revenue going that I could fund the excess myself. Using blockchain to do the heavy lifting makes the operational costs dirt cheap when compared to other platforms that do similar things. For example, UpWork is the biggest competitor and it needs to take a 20% fee to stay profitable. With blockchain, I could possibly go as low as 5%. Once the Marketplace establishes its reputation, all of those developers on UpWork (there are millions) would flock to the Marketplace simply because it doesn't take so much from them. It is also easier to pay people around the globe with ADA than with fiat. This would allow it to be truly global unlike UpWork and the others like it. We could do marketing to encourage the developer migration when the time is right (it has to be easy to by and sell ADA).  

I know it is the entire pot but this is the only project I have seen that has the potential to be profitable enough to fund other projects in the space. In other words, it is the only one that can potentially open up another significant funding source in addition to driving adoption. Another source would be a huge boost to Cardano.

17/Aug/20 3:35 PM,315978,50,Alejandro Boscoboinik,"@eysteinh  Great points here!

Agreed, we need easier access to published research. In the US, taxpayer-funded research (national labs and government-funded research in general, which is most of it) is open in principle but one has to play trick to find the information. It is usually posted in not-easy-to-find repositories. Having an AI platform to search through these repositories and organizes the information in an easily searchable way would be another great spin-off of this project. Here's an example of one such source of publications from the US: https://www.osti.gov/search-tools . This is not just for publications, but also for patents, code, etc, funded by the US government.

So, easier access to information is one of the problems. The second one is the jargon used, many people would not understand what the authors want to say because it is written in a jargon that a very small community can understand, and not necessarily the people that have the problem to be solved. It all goes back to communication and building the bridges so that what is written in those articles could be translated to the people for which that research is useful. One of the things the Dscience to Dtech platform could do is to link all the relevant players and facilitate the communication between them to lead to useful outcomes. It is possible that AI could help here in the communication and translating jargon, which is also worth exploring.",NO

I agree that in most cases as you mentioned, currently, people have problems and they look into science to provide solutions. This leads to progress. However, in addition to that, I truly believe we are missing out on much bigger things. There is a lot of research around the world (in fact most research) that is never considered because it does not address an immediate specific problem, or because it is written in a way (overly technical jargon) that people who may use it simply does not understand it.

17/Aug/20 2:35 PM,316392,114,Morgan ,"@shapiro21  I think the ideas could work very well together but not really combine?  
  
My logic is that this could be a very quick to market solution to bring business owners and entrepreneurs to Cardano. By:  
  
1\. Ensuring the consultants fully understand what benefits Cardano has to offer

  
2\. Ensuring the consultants have access to those experts best placed to answer specific questions (within reason) and the workings of the portal and voting mechanism / legalities

  
3\. Devise the renumeration structure and robust contracts for consultants

  
4\. Consultants start networking and onboarding new proposals!  
  
  
Consultants could even act as a sh\*t filter.

  

There is no need to develop anything elaborate just some contracts, rates of 'pay' some kind of proof of identity and with proactive consultants (like you and I for example) we can be active very quickly. Then build out the larger stuff? Just my thoughts.",NO

For example, if a developer beats a smart contract coding game on Hard Mode, it could be added to his profile. That could help build his reputation as a developer and incentive people to actually play the games (they would probably learn a lot even if they are already competent).",NO

And since the platform would already be aggregating developers and entrepreneurs, the consultants would be right there. We can possibly do a small subscription model per consultant. For example, a user could subscribe to John Smith's blog for 1 ADA per month. John could keep all of that if the blog is posted on the blockchain (he would need to pay the transaction fee for posting it). Or if it is better not to put it on the blockchain, the Marketplace could host it and take a 10% cut of the John's subscription. His target audience would already be on the Marketplace anyway.

Since all of the competitors of the marketplace take a 20% fee, the Marketplace can easily undersell them if it uses blockchain as the backbone.

I think centralised vs decentralised pool governance is a better way to say it. I'm working on a better write-up of the idea. Will be looking to update it before the 19th initial draft cut off.

No Most pools don't currently need it, but I think that will change. This would always be an opt in system, if a pool operator/owner/s don't want to open up any direct control to stakers they wouldn't have to.

I do plan to offer my pool as a test case, along with another few. If stakers join them then it will be a clear signal that stakers want to try this. Just getting it all ready to go, and looking for any input, refinement.

Yes there is a lot of internal interest within my pool already to get involved. I am a pool maintained by 1 person, the idea enables me to get help and draw on skills of stakers from within the pool. I will be sharing some of the pool tax collected with these stakers that get involved creating internal pool ADA paid jobs.

This!

The need and 'hunger' for organic/biological food is growing worldwide, especially in the Western countries.

Knowing what you eat is becoming increasingly more important.

Furthermore, my idea also aims to cut costs on both sides (business/consumer), by cutting the middlemen.

Note that i have no expertise on farming of food distribution, but i am aware about this business side since i live in a agriculturel area here in The Netherlands. I see and hear a lot of info coming by and thats where this Idea comes from.

The market is huge.

Thanks for commenting and i love the Idea of a pilot !

As a start, feel free to share my plan with your family.",NO

Maybe even just a place for right now that what you are talking about could happen right now while waiting for the next version of an MVP.

I think you are right about the next MVP being on a domain name and since you are tight on funds now I just went and purchased thedevelopermarketplace.com after the mandatory waiting period for new domain purchases I will transfer ownership to you. Until then I will review your proposal again in more detail and get some of the concepts built on the domain purchased so we can begin trying to attract DEVs. The website does have to be on the blockchain to be a POC. Just getting people to create a profile proves interest in using the platform. In lean startup, this is a customer development experiment to test the idea Haskell devs would want something like this.

It is way easier than trying to find new free-lance work repeatedly. And your fee comment about Upwork is exactly why this platform is needed. This business model can easily under-sell all of those other platforms due to the cheap operating costs of using blockchain. This platform can under-sell the others by a wide margin. Right now, it is a relatively niche market, but the future is tending towards remote free-lance work. We just need to make finding the work at an affordable fee, easier.

Also if this is to be good for the animals also, then you need to have some sort of partnership with AWA Animal Welfare Approved. It is a free certification for farmers that ensures the animals on their farm are being treated fairly and given a good life, not caged in some small pen or locked on the concrete.

In this scenario, let us say the 20 whales vote ""yes"" and everyone else votes ""no.""  

In the vote based on capital, the whales dominate and their yes's make up 80% of the vote. So in the capital vote, the yes's win.

In the vote based on population, 80% voted no and so the no's win.  

Exact same vote, two different outcomes simply due to the different weights. What makes it bicameral is that the underlying influences affecting each house are different, not that the actual votes are different. (@jonmcguffinjr may have just said this and I just misunderstood.)",NO

WTIM is a Voting platform, so if Governance is a focus of Project Catalyst, then what better way to learn more about it by creating a Dapp that rewards Voters and improves their communities through a Vote.

WTIM doesn't need a blockchain to be successful. Actually I have had experts and Devs tell me that I should consider not having blockchain be part of our platform because it will make the time and cost to build will be more. And that it could limit adoption of WTIM because if people have to use some special wallet or something to engage in the campaigns, that most people in the world don't use those things and thus not going to take part in a WeThinkItMatters campaign if the blockchain makes it harder for them.

On the topic of BAT and Brave browser. In some ways sure they are innovative, but WTIM and BAT are two different things. Brave is a tool for browsing the web, you could visit a WeThinkItMatters Campaign using Brave. Brave shows ADs to users that Advertisers have paid for, those ADs are to sell you something or almost always about getting your money somehow. When you click on an AD from Brave you get some BAT which represents a portion of what the Advertiser spent on the Cost Per Click (CPC). Brave is making the most money and none of the money the Advertiser spent is improving anything in the world. These are just the same ADs will already have but now Brave is getting a portion of the AD spend each year and throwing some pennies out for the masses in exchange for their attention.

WeThinkItMatters is a new paradigm on advertising and what KIND of value and ROI it delivers. There is a secret in the marketplace that businesses haven't told you, and that secret is you are valuable! Everywhere you look today businesses are trying to get your attention and money. Your attention is valuable, and with WTIM you get more from it.

What if I told you there are more than five hundred billion dollars a year being spent to influence you, but with WTIM you have the opportunity to influence it. Instead of businesses using advertising to try and influence what we want, now with WeThinkItMatters we can use advertising as a sustainable funding source for causes impacting all of us.

There is a special feeling you get from doing something for someone else, and that goes for both parties. Well, your probably not a billionaire or even a millionaire, but what if I told you could make an impact like you were. If you wish to make a difference in the world, WeThinkItMatters gives you the opportunity to have a positive impact with a Vote.

Businesses have been trying to get our attention and spending huge amounts to do it, and now with WeThinkItMatters we can tell them what to pay attention to. WeThinkItMatters offers you the ability to have a Vote in how some of the five hundred billion dollars spent on advertising each year is used.

But if you propose this for the broader Cardano ecosystem - I will oppose this idea for 2 reasons: (And of course let's wait for the document from Dor where we can see suggested vote mechanics for Catalyst)

1\. Cybil attacks. There won't be a problem for some oligarch to create lots of identities (which might be even not fake) and give then 100 ADAs to acquire the necessary amount of votes.

2\. I think 1 ADA = 1 vote is a simple and fair vote approach. It is real ""Skin in the game"", it's not equality, but of course equality doesn't exist in life. Early Cardano adopters and investors will have bigger power, but that's it.

Btw, at the moment my ADA holding as very small (and will remain so for some time), so I won't be influential in voting by stake, but I can say my opinion of forum, reddit and maybe some big holder will agree to it.

I mention this, as if Binance and other exchanges already have this process possible in the Philippines, your project won't be competitive, as it will have higher fees.

I'm looking for somebody to ""own"" that project as I don't have the time required, but I could help as a consultant. I think the primary difference from our proposals are a few things:  
  
1-Structure and Framework for what needs to be solved:  
Instead of allowing people to simply create a ""post"" on what's needed, we first ""walk"" then thru a process that requires them to buld a ""framework"" of the current environment that they work on, this frame work would include things like, indusry, departments, services, roles, systems being used by departments and roles, etc... By creating this framework, we can do a few things: A- We give potential solution providers with a lot more concise information on what type of need they have and the 'environment"" that clietn works on, so the ""problem"" is more accurate and easy to understand.  
B-It provides a foundation for others in similar fields to continue building on that framework, C-The ""crowd"" can validate the framework and the problem, making it more accurate and ellaborate as time progresses  
  
2-We would pay industry professionals to buiild the framework, the problems and the solutions, so initially, everyone would get paid (with funds from IOHK)

  

3-We would leverage Machine Learning so as time progresses, the platform could leverage all data to quickly and easily provide a set of recommendations to users, plus those teams of consultants that would help them execute that idea (See last page on document ""Par B"" or ""Dream Weaver"" proposal I posted).

But overall I think it's a great idea to test and pilot, specially on younger demographics. I also think the learning experience and results could be transferred over to a project like the one I proposed (Dream Weaver), which is basically a data repository of everything that relates to business value that is created on top of Cardano.

More than 1000 pools are already, while some of them might look similar, others are very different, and teams behind them are also very different.

Having zero notice about being accepted to the Project Cataylst melting pot and only part-way through building my application I can see how it looks like the project needs more ""fleshing out"", but I can guarantee the thoughts and plans behind the project given the right amount of backing in terms of finance and partnership support would have a huge return on investment for the Cardano brand.

Let me explain my thoughts which should ultimately result in me being able to improve the proposition for the next stage in this experiment.

The fact the fitness, health and mindfulness space is growing is not negative, this shows there is an amazing growing opportunity for the right project to be successful. Good problems are popular for a reason but that should never stop innovation.

Mental health is one of the fastest growing spaces in the health industry and awareness has never been so strong however the underfunded and under-researched industry is at a critical junction.

Wellbeing effects everyone in their lifetime and there is a real urgent need to research and understand how people's mental state affects their lives, jobs and family's.

The current software applications concentrate on one element of people's lives whether its fitness, mental health or mindfulness. In truth we are all driven by different needs throughout and life and throughout the day. A fitness fanatic one day with Bi-polar can be crippled another day and there daily goal is not to walk an extra 1km its just to get out of bed and make it through the day.

My project will adapt to the day-to-day struggles and highs gently suggesting self-help where it can and helping general fitness when appropriate. Fitness is proved to be a great help in the fight to help mental health but if the person cannot even face the postman how are they going to get the motivation to run a mile?

Lots of mental health issues are hidden and self-help is an amazing way to reach out.

The mixture of the 3 datasets will also provide fascinating scientific data in what techniques can help and how peoples need for help changes throughout their life/days.

The app will be used multiple times a day and should quickly spread through many forms such as fitness and medical hubs.

For those lucky people with no mental health issues, the introduction to meditation and fitness goals could enrich their lives even more.

Why will this create value for Cardano? That's a simple one.

I have followed Cardano since 2017 and believe the mathematical and scientifically approach shares the same values and fundamentals as myself and what I want my project to build upon. I want to associate my product with the Cardano brand and believe they in turn will want to associate with product and my brand for the same reasons.

I am looking for a long term disruptive partner that can understand my vision and believe Cardano is the right company and block chain to build upon

I don't want a successful business built upon Ethereum for example that could fail in a few years because the block chain foundations it was built upon crumble taking me down with it. Ethereum and others are quick to the market and this will be shown that they are playing catch-up with Cardano - I can't wait or take the chance on a project that is running 1000 miles down the track to try and change their engine mid race.

I believe my project can be 10x better than the competition and it doesn't faze me to start from behind, I can build on their wins and mistakes and use it to my advantage.

The decentralised and community led element of a lot of my eco-system will help the project grow and at every possible step I will be shining the light of Cardano who helped grow and continues to support the project that I hope ultimately will change people's lives forever and give them some hope and release from the crippling disease that is mental health.",NO
16/Aug/20 4:12 PM,316119,92,Umed--[SKY] SkyLight Pool,"@robgreig  I wanted clarify something here. The risk of centralization isn't that of one single entity or a group of entities taking over the network. Rather, my concern is that current incentive schemes, when optimized against two performance dimensions (fees, uptime), would inevitably move the entire network into the cheapest cloud infrastructure.

Imagine a substantial number of different Cardano pool operators all hosting their nodes with a handful of companies (to stay competitive on costs).

That may not be an apparent risk, but it does pose structural single-point-of-failure risks (e.g. what if these companies ban staking operations? what if their network suffers an attack?).  

For the network to sustain a diversified topology, it needs to have a way to offer something in addition to rewards. Introducing a platform where all these added dimensions of pool performance live, along with avenues that facilitate interaction between SPOs and their stakeholders, will ultimately diversify offerings and attract a wider audience of delegators who would keep Cardano decentralized.",NO

16/Aug/20 3:27 PM,316657,137,James Dunseith,"Thank you for posting this idea @juliane  it really resonates with me. Ideas with the biggest potential are often the messiest and most vulnerable, and establishing safe ways to work toward making them viable will go a long way toward real innovation. Establishing trust and community through competency matching has the potential to resonate far beyond this initial Catalyst experiment.

In defining any system of governance, of course we have to pay attention to the technical details of how things must work; these details can be codified in rules and laws. Equally important are the unwritten ""norms"" in a system, and your proposal makes me think about those. Although it's hard to create legislation that makes space for vulnerable ideas to take root, the norms we set now for how ideas are shared and nurtured will help to signal what kind of space this becomes. Again, messy work.

Yes, Brave users can buy WTIM to advertise ""socially"" and WTIM token holders can buy BAT to advertise on Brave. Or let's say if they want to support a particular site (it's already possible to support Cryptotexty with BAT).

They are tokenizing every property. IGP Tokens would represent a stake in all the real estate Investment Group Properties LLC owns, not individual properties. So Token holders risk would be lower since they would not be betting on one property.  

To start we will primarily only do fix&flip and land development and sell for profit. We would do owner financing(hold the note) on properties down the road when IGP had enough reserves.

Or we could have two Tokens from the start, one that invested in fix&flips and one that invested in buy and seller finance. And people could buy one or the other or both and diversify that way.

""How many previous corporations have sponsored WTIM campaigns."" I sold 1 beta campaign for $10,000 as mentioned above been improving WTIM since that one, have not gone back to the market with it.

Thank you Dan very much for your input. Yes, in the Cardano ecosystem when you placed your vote, it would - behind the scenes - go into both houses. On the one side, your vote would carry the weight relative to the ADA you are holding behind it. On the other side it would carry the vote as you the individual.

Theoretically, and this is all open for discussion/change, funding requests would need to pass both houses in order to move forward. This would mean that if the big whales wanted something to go through, they would still have to convince a MAJORITY stakeholders for it to happen. it also means that just because a majority of stakeholders are convinced or think something should move through, the people who actually have the largest to gain and lose by those proposals must also be in agreement.",NO

Mail in balloting has to be the most flawed idea I have ever seen in my life as a proud American. It will be such a mess and SO easy to vote multiple times. Our registration process is easier to sign up for than creating a gmail account. With no in person voting, people can enjoy from their homes voting as many times as they want. I can stand in line everywhere right now, in the store, at the restaurant; literally everywhere yet I can't stand in line to vote at the polls? Think about that for a minute and how much sense that doesn't make.  
  
THIS is the reason voting needs to be on the blockchain. I'm not talking governance voting for/within the system, now I'm speaking of voting for political office. In the US, it's very easy. You're 18 or older, you are a US Citizen, you have one living address or address of residence, and you get ONE vote. Case closed. This would be easy to acheive with DID and the blockchain.

At the end of each week a VRF (verifiable random function) selects a ticket from the pool and they win all of the stake/interest accrued from fees. No loss lotteries like this can actually incentive saving and in a way it's like you are creating a positive sum game.

Seriously though I think we need to make an aggressive pitch for integrating all public voting on the network to be tied to Prism (even if it does not end up being 1 Prism ID = 1 Vote). In the same breath how can we encourage devs to build public facing voting systems that utilize Atala Prism? To me that's where the real Bicameralism voting mechanism magic comes into play. Take U.S. for example we are in a situation where the President is holding the Postal Service hostage in a clear attempt of voter suppression for the upcoming election. The GOP can immediately shoot down any request to do eVoting because ""the Dems will game it"". We all know the advent of blockchain and more specifically ID products like Prism makes this argument completely moot and we are already seeing early implementations in public voting: https://cointelegraph.com/news/indias-citizens-will-vote-with-blockchain-election-commissioner-says.

We need to ensure that blockchain education, problem/inefficiency identification (many times this is the base of innovation), funding, and general awareness on Cardano powered solutions are a key focus for West African nations. What does this mean in action? It means education material being produced for developing financial products in Marlowe/general purpose applications on Plutus are sponsored in African universities for finance/business students to innovate. It means we need to scale up the IOHK Africa team (specifically in Ghana and Nigeria and other West African nations).

The incentives for a foreign investor to gain exposure to Real Estate in US/UK/Europe are clearly very sticky and we already see a large amount of Chinese family offices do this in places like NYC today. This app idea also exists already on Ethereum its called RealT. Here is there site: https://realt.co/.

This can be seen when crytocurrencies split based on fundamental principles, ex Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

Perhaps I'm being a little too idealistic here, but maybe there is a chance here for us to create a platform that enables people to extend beyond a few monolithic groups of ideas. Perhaps the system could be built in such a way that it would encourage individuals to expand their understanding of certain stereotypes and be given additional tools in the voting process to do research into a topic and be regularly invited to explore other perspectives, thereby reducing the tendency to clump ideas together into something like a political party.

That would mean having identity as well. This way in case of disputes outside of the financial parts of the contract you could use the court systems for this. In Norway an example is how we adapt EU law into our system so we are in compliance even when we have our own national laws. Same would be with a smart contract with its own set of parameters for when it is valid or not but should also be in compliance with the national/transnational laws. I hope that somewhat answers the question and I suggest we do pilots with some simple type of contracts.

Binsheng is working on treasury using cardinal voting methods and I believe will implement a reputation system as well in the future. This is to experiment in a lower cost setting (not full treasury) with other voting methods to iterate as I mentioned some examples of above. While a top down approach is great and definitively needed I think also organic bottom up of governance is good as well. This is what would happened if we users of cardano ourself tried to experiment with other voting methods.

The smart contract/dApp will be deployed for free so the ""idea owner"" is in a complete win-win situation. Their idea is launched and it costed them 0. The developer on the other hand takes all risk by developing and implementing the dApp (which may or may not become a success). This is also much less of an issue if you attach a reputation system \[built on top of Prism ;)\] to this ""Idea meets Dev on Cardano"" application.

We can also give the ""idea owner"" the right to include additional mitigation (only describing a high level overview of their app idea, only give access to devs with prior reputations, demanding a signed NDA before further discussion/dev start).

The one question that I have is does this mean that everyone would get two votes? I ask because, the bicameral system uses representatives to cast votes, so you can easily say that the members of one house cannot cast a vote in the other house. However, in the Cardano ecosystem, there are no representatives, only individual members, so that means that the same individual would have to cast a vote in both houses, right? If so, in principle, they would cast the same vote twice which would not actually play out to be a bicameral system, even if the two votes were weighted differently.",NO

If you are wondering about how to ""jump in the water"", I have a suggested approach.

Put yourself in the position of having spoken with someone about the Catalyst Program, and they are excited. Naturally they begin asking you questions about HOW can they get involved and be funded.

Now, take a look at each Topic in the process (Ideate, Refine, etc) and think hard about what is NOT YET defined in my starting of the framework/process. If you think this through you will see LOTS of detail that is missing and required to be of any true value.

Here, Let me give you a start on another piece:

Within the Ideate Phase I see a need for what I am calling a ""Curation Tree"". This begins to define the Process within the Ideate Phase in a more granular way, and leads to thought about Resources REQUIRED to move an idea through the Process.

The Curation tree:

**Vetting of the Project:**

*   Similarity to other projects
*   Idea viability
*   network effect (% of stake holders improved)
*   completeness of proposal (white paper, proofs, etc)

**Vetting of the Proposer (individual/group):**

*   known entity in the ecosphere?
*   Skills evaluation (can they execute the plan)
*   Collaborative capabilities/willingness

More Clarity and definition is needed in this Curation Process, indeed more steps after Vetting occurs.",NO

We went with the name ""AFRICAN DEVELOPER TRAINING CENTER"" for our launch phase because at our phase 1 we intend to work with developers with a little background experience we believe that our name will attract this kind of audience. We intend to create an curate original training/e-learning contents/hands-on activities during this phase. We will eventually transition to using a digital library combined with real time physical/online lectures and peer to peer leaning. We are not really specializing as we will have general content on blockchain with special emphasis on Cardano. Our goals are beyond just a training center, it would also serve as a point to access open source content, incubation hub for startups,venue for cardano events/publicity. We will be actively creation solutions and solving the problems that communities across Africa are facing.

Internet connectivity are not widespread in most parts of Nigerian hence reliance on USSD based services rather than smart phones and distance learning is still at it's infancy stage in fact schools only started looking into it since the emergence of this pandemic. Learning has been on hold since the advent of Covid-19 and in Nigeria only students in key classes have returned back to school. In summary, we're not fully equipped or ready for online e-learning especially due to the high cost of internet and related resources. This is not to say that we will not leverage on online learning, I'm just noting the limitations inherent within Africa.

No city has 24hrs electricity in Nigeria. Urban locations can provide good internet. We intend to buy/rent a good facility, we also intend to work with existing hubs in other locations in the country so as to increase our reach. In essence our model has one major hub in major cities in Africa.

In the long run we intend to own our infrastructure so as to reduce costs, it's a long term project we structured into phases and milestones so we can measure our successes and adapt in order to succeed across Africa.

We will definitely be open for partnerships within and outside the community.

We have team members with experience in setting up and running hubs within Nigeria.

As I stated earlier, the project is structured into phases and the funding requested is for our launch phase. yeah In the long run it will provide access to skilled manpower and reduce development costs of dapps on the cardano ecosystem.We see an opportunity to develop a gender inclusive programs for youths and proficient developers as well as provide them with the environment they need to make their ideas and projects a reality.

15/Aug/20 2:05 PM,316015,56,Eystein Hansen,An idea very much in line with the goals of found1. I am interested in the filter aspect as if this is to scale that function has to be handled well. Now here is my far fetched and little tought out musing on this: I was wondering if random sampling from developers could help filter and user could select rank by random sampling of developers opinion or such? This could be a way to incentivize developers to read up on projects and earn ada by offering opinion on a project if its viable and valueble from a developers standpoint.

But these are just examples of my initial thinking - what do you think is the main reason why there are so few people being aware of these discoveries? Lack of knowledge to the problems at hand ?

Clearer definition of what type of medical data is allowed on the system and how it is going to be used is an important part of any ethical considerations. How will the system ensure people understand the consequences of selling own data? (targeted ads based on your genetic makeup etc). With that said I see this fitting very well in an overall arching picture of not only having control of your own data but utilizing your own data for good and for your own benefit.

My understanding is that our current challenge Is to Develop a plan to attract developers via the catalyst program/process. This will inform the next cohort and so on until we have enough traction that catalyst is no longer needed.

If I'm correct, I have one simple question.

When one is working toward attracting folks to develop on Cardano via catalyst, what do we have to say when asked how this works? Do we have a process defined? Do we have timelines? Do we have contracts to review with them?

I get it, we could all just hit the streets shouting ""FUNDING HERE, Come and get it"". But without a process to actually onboard them, we are going to hit a wall..

Who would expect anything of substance to happen outside of a well defined process?

We are not here for makig these decsions, Cardano has already decide to launch the Project Catalyst FUND and to give out funding. We weren't invited to Fund1 to tell them how Voting needs to work or decide when the they invest the funding. The whole point of Fund1 is to develop a proposal process that encourages as many entrepreneurs and business to build on Cardano, thats it that is our mission.

15/Aug/20 2:26 AM,316123,94,shapiro21,"Oh I thought the internet was more wide spread in Africa than that. Actually, one of my goals in life is to fund the infrastructure building like what you are talking about. The model that I have been considering is as follows:

1\. I would call it something more in line of a Digital Library rather than a training center. If I was walking by the venue and was just looking for an internet connection to do work, I would not consider a training center as a place to do work. If I name it a ""training center"", I will only attract people who think they need training. If I called it a ""digital library"", libraries are known for being places to both study and work. Maybe your culture is different but I hope you understand what I mean. It is better not to specialize in the early days and a ""training center"" implies specializing for students. I am sure there are already developers in African cities even if they are rare. I would want these people to come too.

2\. I would still strive for the udemy application. I haven't run the numbers but I think having one venue that can connect to the immense amount of resources already on the internet is far more efficient and cost effective than trying to create African specialized courses and schools. For example, Haskell is Haskell whether you are in London or Nigeria. There are already resources online for learning Haskell. If I can just tap into them, it would save me a lot of time and money.

3\. I would pick a city that has good internet and stable electricity. Buy or rent a large building there and make sure the internet can be reached in every part of the building. I would then divide the building into sections where a person or group of people can go and either work or study.

4\. I would plan on operating at a loss for 5-10 years. The people working in the building most likely won't be able to pay anything for using it. They probably just won't have the money. If I was running a stake pool, I would funnel as much of the profit as needed into paying for the building for those years.

5\. After a while, developers should have learned from the udemy or coursera courses already available and could then start looking for jobs. My Help Wanted platform would be perfect for them finding remote work. After working for a while, they would then be able to pay a very small fee for using the building. I want to emphasize the very; it shouldn't impact their budget at all otherwise they may stop coming. At this point, the building could be self-funding if not profitable.

6\. I would only do one building at a time, especially in the beginning because it is a risky venture. I would only consider creating another building somewhere else once the previous building is self-funding. I would target all the major cities in Africa for locations to build these digital libraries. I would only branch out from the cities once I have built these digital libraries in most cities and they are sustainable.

The fact that I could run a pool is actually a huge plus because it can continuously give me money to fund this. However, it will be very expensive because I have to front the money for several years. I don't know what the average cost of things in Africa is but it would probably be similar to owning a large building in a big city in Africa with electricity always running. I would need to be able to fund it for about 7 years. That is my starting point for a budget and it is always better to have extra. You would know better than me but I am skeptical that 655,000 ADA will be enough for this. It will probably be a decade long endeavor. I would have enough for the 7 years and plan on putting the majority of my stake pool profits toward it. If I need to live off the stake pool profits too, then I would have enough for the full 10 years just in case. I would also have room in my budget in case I need to supply the digital library with computers. If I have extra at the end, it is there for the next digital library.

I actually think this is the best way for Africa to diversify its economy. Personally, I would not build a business with a physical presence in Africa. It would be too risky. However I would pay an African developer to make my company's website! Especially since the hourly wage could be sooo much less than if I hired a US or European developer. Africa just has to get developers online. It will start slowly but all things start slowly. India followed a similar plan by being IT departments for developed nations and that is now one of the largest sectors of India's economy. Africa can be the web designers or something like that.

As you know, Africa lives under conditions of a grossly underdeveloped economic, physical, educational, communication and other infrastructure. It has virtually no possibility to exercise what in reality amounts to a theoretical right to equal opportunity, with that right being equal within every 3rd world nation only to the extent that it is equally incapable of realization.

Most of people and devs here don't have a private access to internet and infrastructure that is needed for learning or working in good conditions. The need for an AFRICAN DEVELOPER TRAINING CENTER cannot be over emphasized. We wanna provide them with the basics they need to learn and work professionally.

Most African countries (even in Nigeria which is a ""privileged"" Country compare to some other within the continent) have inefﬁcient ICT-related infrastructure such as electricity,telecommunications, and computers. Therefore,the three pillars of the ICT revolution, that is, connectivity, capacity and content, are yet to be realized in Africa. We have start with what is feasible and obtainable right now.

Your DID would replace your social security number, or country equivalent. This is your entire identity which is what allows you to interact in the global economy, get loans, buy houses, rent apartments, etc. If Cardano collapses, you would lose the ability to do everything I just listed. You already have stake in the system just by having a DID. When you say whether someone ""has stake in it"" you are really asking ""do they care about it succeeding?"" If someone has a DID, the answer to this question is a definite yes. There is no need to link ADA to the DID to verify that they have stake in the system. It is redundant. Even if Cardano doesn't collapse, if your DID gets compromised it is the same as identity theft. I think that is enough of a threat to make people care.

14/Aug/20 9:11 PM,316392,114,Boone Bergsma,"I shared this on Telegram think it relates well to this proposal so reposting

I was part of an experimental online accelerator program that gave out funding to run customer development experiments testing a hypothesis we had about our business ideas. The focus was key metrics you were measuring in the single objective experiment and brought awesome learning by testing the hypothesis with potential ideal clients. This whole program was run on trello and mentors(those who had done customer development experiments help new entrepreneurs through the process of creating a hypothesis to test and then submitting it for funding. I could see something very similar for proposal on ideascape. Imagine Ideascape is where proposals start, and when anyone wants to make a proposal for ADA funding the first submit on Ideascape and a group of mentors(like us to start) would work with those submitting to format their proposal correctly(while at the same time filtering spam) and once the proposal was formatted correctly it could be submitted for community Voting. This would help create high-quality ideas and proposals that went to the community and create a mentor driven incubator for proposal creation. And Cardano could pay bounties to mentors based on contribution to helping people creaft high-quality proposals. It turn the submission process into a center of innovation where mentors and future mentors were collaborating :diamonds:

One of the most important things in the process I mentioned was the key aspects of the hypothesis. And I think that is very much also key in Proposals. For example, key aspects of FUND proposals(not CIP) should be things like, Timeline and Milestones, Budget needs to be explained also clear as possible(this much is gong here, this much going here, etc.). And it might make sense to have funds awarded paid out based on the receiver reporting back to the proposal with results based on the timeline and milestones set. If they don't achieve something it doesn't no more of the funding, but they have share why it didn't happen. Those milestones and timeline could be tied directly to the cycles of the FUNDs(6-8 weeks). So I might be asking for $100k, but only requesting $50 at the start because I was going to use for this and that, and then in 6 weeks another $25k to continue paying team and services, and 6 weeks later the othe $25 after which I believe the business will be self-sustaining.

14/Aug/20 8:59 PM,316323,106,shapiro21,"@kungfucrypto  The science that I have seen in regards to voting on topics is that you actually don't need everyone to be an expert. You don't even need to know who the experts are. Imagine a voting situation where you can vote yes or no and there are 100 voters. Let us say 40 of them are experts and vote yes on the topic. The other 60 non-experts split their vote: half yes, half no. Then the votes are tallied. In this context, the non-experts canceled themselves out and you are left with the 40 yes votes from the experts. This vote is actually safe unless 51 of the 60 non-experts vote no. While possible, it is unlikely for that many non-experts to randomly agree.

The studies show you need a relatively large sample and diverse opinions. If you have these two conditions fulfilled, the extreme and un-informed decisions cancel themselves out. This has worked for samples around 100 voters so the sample doesn't need to be that large.

Obviously this isn't perfect because if the opinions polarize, the extreme and un-informed opinions don't cancel out. That is why precautions need to be taken to prevent this. Factors like geographic, cultural, socio-economical, etc should all be diverse. To further prevent polarization you can use a bicameral voting system like my House of ADA and Senate of Cardanians idea or the other bicameral idea that was posted. That is why most developed nations have bicameral governments.

IOHK is actually testing this theory with us. We are the voters. Some people are more educated than others. Will the differing opinions cancel each other out and result in a favorable conclusion?

The idea that your DID would show how be able to check if you have ADA sounds like the right path to me, even if you just have 1 ADA. If you have an ADA, you should have a Vote and if you have more than 1, each one should be a Vote. If your Prism DID didn't have an ADA balance connected than no Vote from your DID.

Also, I think when weighing the two branches they need to be as equal as possible, for example

The total of all ADA Votes makes up 50% of total and DID Votes make up 50% of the total Vote. So adding those two together will give a pretty fair distribution and representation of Votes.

Using this information, it would be easy to automate the rule that for a person to be eligible to vote in either house, they must have both a DID and ADA. It should be able to check this easily. I understand the desire to give everyone a vote but I wonder if 80% of the poulation being able to vote is enough. As it is, voter turnout never reaches 100% of eligible voters.

People will be using the DID as a gateway to use services and those don't necessarily come at a cost. If you use DID to board an airplane, no cost no need. If you use it to play on a social media platform, no cost.

Again, I do agree that most who have a DID will hold ADA but do we really think everybody is going to go to some exchange and buy ADA to have it? I'd say 80% of the population if asked on the street what an ""exchange"" is they wouldn't even be able to clearly tell you what an exchange is or does.

If there is ever a situation where a significant group of people have a DID but don't own ADA, then that would be a different story and honestly the solution may be a lot more messy.

Your response is really helping me to clarify my idea - so let's see if this distinction makes sense.

With this proposal, I am not as much thinking about training people to build smart contracts. Instead, I am recognizing that plenty of smart contracts, once written, will be modular and re-usable, and there are many people out there with important skill sets that are separate from writing code. I want these people to be able to efficiently learn just enough about the Cardano platform, so that they can apply their talents where most needed.

Take my somewhat trivial example of a t-shirt fundraiser from the proposal above. If we write a smart contract and a voting app implementation that allows (a) crowdfunding toward some cause with a t-shirt as gift swag, (b) artists to submit a design for what will appear on that swag, and (c) funders to vote on which design will appear on their swag, then I can imagine multiple people wanting to apply that ""package"" to their own ideas.

These people might be highly-engaged community members, influencers, artists, etc, whose time and talent are best applied to things other than writing great code from scratch. These are people who might (a) be committed experts to a cause in need of fundraising, (b) know a network of artists who would love to contribute designs to that cause, and (c) be able to motivate a network of people to support that cause, especially if they get some cool, community-designed swag. There are potentially thousands of people who might want to use a starter pack like this, and who would be willing to learn just enough about the smart contract to open it up and tweak some values. In turn, they'd now have that basic expertise in how the platform works, and their imaginations would be open to new possibilities. (Side note: outsiders with fresh perspective are often enough the ones who recognize an unexpected use of a new technology. All of us who have been deeply engaged in blockchain for years are probably missing the ideas right under our noses - waiting for a newcomer to light up the next killer app.)

Perhaps a few would discern a calling to go much deeper into writing smart contracts for brand new use cases, but others would be satisfied that they were able to exhibit some ownership over the tech while still saving most of their time and talent for other things.",NO
14/Aug/20 4:05 PM,316123,94,shapiro21,"I like the idea but I think you can actually go bigger for cheaper than you think (without sacrificing quality). If you created a standardized Udemy course, you could have all of your students learn at their own pace. The professors will still be there (remotely) for support by answering forum questions and emails. Platforms like Udemy are making it so much easier for professors to teach with less effort. Instead of the professor having to actually teach the same course every year, the professor can create the video lectures and material once and just upload it to a platform like Udemy. Then students can access it anytime. You can charge a monthly fee for access or make it free. I believe this is where education is actually heading. This means it would be even easier to recruit professors to teach since they don't need to uproot their lives.

In addition this course could be open to everyone, not just African developers. If at the end of the course, you suggest areas to help Africa, you can make not only African developers aware of the issues but developers all over the world. Blockchain can be built remotely (but being physically there can help). I would personally use your Udemy course (and pay) and I am in the United States.

I do think you should still have a venue for students to learn near one another. Studies show being around other students who are working dramatically encourages others to work hard. But you would only need to give them computers with an internet connection. This method could have a much larger impact for African developers at a fraction of the cost.  

As a final note, I think your idea maps well with mine called Developer Help Wanted - Platform. At the end of your course, you could have them all sign up on the Developer Help Wanted - Platform and they could potentially get jobs working remotely for entrepreneurs half-way around the world. That means more money flowing into Africa for further developments.

In posting this idea, my goal is certainly to start a conversation and to see how this Catalyst community might refine it.

I've been thinking a lot about how this idea would fit in alongside Emurgo Academy and IOHK Education. Both Emurgo Academy and IOHK Ed are the realm of genius (I don't use that term often, but it's warranted here), and both are essential to the existence of the platform on which we're building. By envisioning what mainstream adoption might entail, my goal is to make sure all of this genius work is accessible to the broadest possible community.

With this proposal, I seek to build upon the foundation built by IOHK and Emurgo by making this technology available to anyone with an idea, in particular anyone who might be more interested in running a small business in their community than understanding all the fundamentals of blockchain development. One thing I love about Plutus and Marlowe is that they're designed to be readable - even someone with limited experience with code can, with guidance and effort, be supported to understand the role of a smart contract and the parameters within it.

While IOHK Education might provide the training to define a programming language in the first place, and Emurgo Academy might train someone to write robust smart contracts, one goal of this project is to support someone to read & understand an existing smart contract, and find the handful of lines where they can tweak a few values to fit their needs. The same applies to voting mechanisms: this project won't train someone in how to build a voting app, but it will provide hands-on experience in using one to support a local business.

14/Aug/20 3:13 PM,316121,93,shapiro21,"@m  I am glad you are thinking about it. Personally, I would not invest in something like this unless the decentralized infrastructure was already in place. I don't want to build something and invest all this time and money only to be held hostage by central entities. I think the tech for decentralized servers is still a fews years away. I know a lot of people who are stuck on archaic infrastructure just because they invested too much time and energy into it for it to be worth leaving; and the central entity knows that and is taking advantage of them.  

However, clearly there is demand right now! And I am all for people trying to pioneer new things. It just isn't for me right now.

14/Aug/20 3:04 PM,316234,101,shapiro21,"Why do you think it is necessary to have a minimum of 100 ADA per ID for a vote? I don't know about every voting system that has been tried on blockchains but I am pretty sure they have all been unicameral. I personally believe they failed for this very reason, not because it was 1 token = 1 vote. The founding fathers of the US were very adament to have bicameralism so that the two houses could balance each other. They feared one house would go un-checked and cause problems; the blockchain voting system seems to be proving this. Arguably, the US founding fathers got it right (anecdotal based on other countries copying them) and the only reason why the US gov. has been decaying over the past 50 years is because of the revolving door between Wallstreet and Congress. The representatives themselves are the weakest link. The House of Representatives was supposed to be the popular vote but bribes to these representatives have changed it from that. The House is no longer the opposite of the Senate and can no longer keep the system balanced. It is now all about money. I personally believe that this is the real problem plaguing the world.

The liquid democracy proposed by Cardano does not have the representatives and can therefore significantly mitigate the ability of bribes to influence politics. Because of this, I don't think it is necessary to force each ID to have 100 ADA. Prism is supposed to connect the ID to biometrics which I think will be enough. You can require fingerprint, facescan, and retinal scan (retinal possibly in the future). The more biometrics included, the harder it is to fake being a real person (or a different person.

The first house in your proposal is influenced by money. By forcing the second house to have 100 ADA is also making it influenced by money (although to a much lessor degree). They can't keep each other in balance if they are influenced by the same thing. Having it only be based on ID for the second house makes it far more immune to the influence of money. Do you disagree?",NO
14/Aug/20 2:57 PM,316121,93,Morgan ,"@shapiro21  Ultimately yes. I believe Dedentraland still run their world from multiple servers. In fact during the public launch in February it became clear to us that something was 'off' and it materialised that they were running different realms just to handle the load. They just use ETH for transacting. So still very centralised.

  

There is a HUGE amount of work required before our public launch where land owners and guests can walk through the world but if we build on Cardano we should be able to launch without splitting the world into pieces. We would be the first truly decentralised world in that respect. With our own native currency which isn't an erc20 token.

  

Your points are all valid. Thank you. This is why I have not yet launched this idea, despite my ability to. These are all discussions to be had up front with the three pillars of Cardano and the wider community. The project will need direct oversight initially but I would love to see the world develop into a truly independent living organism.

14/Aug/20 2:53 PM,315962,42,James Dunseith,"@m  Thank you, and yes, I'd love to collaborate on this.

You're spot on in making the distinction between preparing course material vs. preparing the framework. I also agree that we'll want to leverage all of the learning content that exists from the community. There is so much incredible material, and one immediate step is to curate it. If someone is hearing about Cardano for the first time, what are the two or three videos we'd want them to see first? How might we line up additional content depending on the interests that a new community member identifies? It could be interesting to include relevant video content from IOG or elsewhere linked within a starter pack, providing context for someone coming aboard.

In a way, it's music to my ears to hear you say that the grunt work is in preparing course material, because this is really my wheelhouse, and I know I'm not alone in this. I know that there are other educators within this Catalyst community looking for ways to contribute, and the same is true in the wider Cardano community.

So while a short term goal of this project is to provide a few examples of starter packs, the medium-term goal is to create the platform where other educators can create, share, and iterate on starter packs of their own.

Also Decentraland has a central entity that decides which server hosts to run it on. I read they are attempting to change this to being based off voting, though. While I like the theory of keeping it spread out among many different server companies, the rea world tends to centralize (even bitcoin). Cardano is still attempting to be the first anti-centralizing entity. I can see a world where all of the server hosts sites are bought up by a single entity for economic reasons. Or maybe in the end there are only two or three server host entitiies because they all merged due to economies of scale. It is very easy for two or three entities to collude. Are you concerned about this possibility? Is there anyway to build a decentralized server system first before actually building decentraland? For example, if all phones and computers pool their resources in a decentralized fashion they could possibly host decentraland in a decentralized fashion. But this infrastructure doesn't exist yet. It just bothers me personally to have a middle man (the server hosts) profiting off of a decentralized utility system.

14/Aug/20 11:03 AM,316121,93,Morgan ,"Hi everyone. Elaborating on the importance of using Cardano's $ADA within Pavia:

  

Perhaps the best example is the currency of Decentraland ($MANA) which is an erc20 token build on ethereum.

  

Link: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/decentraland

  

Currently $MANA has a Market Cap of $120 million with $42 million in 24 hour trading volume. The previous ATM Market Cap was a little over $365 million.  
  
Of course not all buying sand selling in Decentraland is in MANA as you can also trade assets in $ETH, on Opense for example.

  

In 2018 a digital land transaction took place for a whopping $215,000. Assuming that wasn't a publicity stunt, it would demonstrate a huge confidence in this evolving technology.

  

The Sandbox Game will soon release their currency $SAND. Although they are very much a gaming platform.

  

The beauty of developing this project and adding $ADA as the native currency is the infrastructure, the community, and confidence is already there. The heavy lifting has already been done. It is just a question of integration things into the new platform.

  

I am sure you will agree that aside from the obvious benefits of developing this digital world and the huge impact of land ownership that the extra liquidity and use cases for $ADA will be epic! :)

  

As stated I can seed fund this, so no funds required, 0, it will self-fund from the initial land sale onwards and I have marketing partners on standby. I just need the support of the community and the digital Cardano world will become a reality much sooner than people realise! Then the real fun starts...

So for example, if there was $250k in the pot every proposal verified real that got VOTEs would some funding, it could even be just a $100 worth of ADA. Not saying that its 1 for 1, but some % based with the top 10 or whatever get the most % spilt between them but there would always be support if your idea reached say a $100 threshold.  
  
I was part of Adam Berks first Experimental mirco investment customer validation incubator where startups/entrepreneurs got invests anywhere from a few hundred bucks to a few thousand to run customer development experiments using lean startup principles to prove their ideas. I can personally tell you take living a bootstrap budget when I received mirco funding from the program it was a blessing and lead to many discoveries. Adam is up to something cool again I just found out https://medium.com/@adamberk/the-first-startup-fund-powered-by-blockchain-44a56744ec3a  

My point is that we want voting to be fair and reach and have the greatest impact them everyone who is willing to put in effort on a proposal that gets VOTEs from people who own ADA should get some amount of funding even if it is just enough to test something about the idea and report and with results.  
  
Many people are lvining and trying to startup on even less than I am blessed to have, so I know there would be people who would submit proposals that even $100 could help them reach the next milestone.

Top 10 gets 50% of funds divided based on VOTEs

21-Any gets 25% of funds divided based on VOTEs

There are a few proposals that could collaborate by doing parts of the other's proposals.  
Even my proposal could use the services of these proposals together.

Cardano's funding would go to proposals where some of those funds would then be spent with other proposals, doubling or triple the ROI the funds had on the ecosystem.  

For example, if I got 10 ADA and use 2ADA to work with proposal1 and spend 3ADA to work with proposal2 and maybe 1ADA to work with proposal3, and then spend the other 4ADA off-chain for things I need that I can't get from the group at this time.

VERY good question. I would like to see a greater diversity and cross over of real world into virtual world businesses. The previous digital worlds have very much been gaming where as I envisage (New) Pavia as a platform to onboard a multitude of entities to offer their products and services.  
  
100% on board with the next Summit being held in our own virtual land. Would be very easy to drop free Non Fungible Tokens (NFT's) such as limited edition t-shirts etc for attendees avatars. Certainly far cheaper than printing and posting several thousand and WAY cooler.  
  
With our build we would include schools, libraries and resource centres. I see it becoming an integral part of the ecosystem. Perhaps even a focal point.

"" This principle has a lot of potential for the eco-system as it provides an incentive for devs and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano ""  
  
Perhaps I didn't explain just how much development work will come out of this proposal. Once the digital land has launched, entrepreneurs and developers can build their ideas and businesses in the real world landscape AND in the digital land. They can chose to service customers in one or both 'realms' For example:  
  
A developer can buy or rent a land parcel (or combine to make a much larger estate) then develop it into an eye-catching attraction. Perhaps even into a game, or even just a HUGE billboard, advertising their services. When visitors come to (New) Pavia they will be able to engage with the Dev and experience his/her work in full effect. As a result they may instruct that Dev to carry out work for them either in the digital word or for a 'real world' based DApp. Better still a multi-verse solution!!  
  
Or maybe an art dealer has had to close their bricks and mortar shop due to the pandemic. They can set up a virtual store in (New) Pavia and exhibit their collections. They can sell NFT (tokenised) works of art as collectibles and even negotiate sales of the real pieces for delivery in the real world. Taking payment in ADA of course! Other than the up front cost to buy (or rent) the land parcel and the digital store front the ongoing costs are negligible. Certainly far less than a traditional store.  
  
Or perhaps a well know casino would like to open a digital casino in (New) Pavia? A library, a t-shirt store, an online VR school, The list is truly endless once we remove the barriers of our regular world.",NO

Don't get me wrong, I like this idea :) I love games and have learned many things from playing them.

Personally I on plan leveraging gaming to teach people about investing, farming, and entrepreneurship.

What would take this idea to the next level is incorporating education and ownership of real assets.  

@m  if you are open to it I would love to work with you to do the following:

Imagine I buy a DEED to a block in New Pavia and it gave me some pixels to create on(my billboard and link to meta info), imagine that also when paid for that DEED with ADA that some of that ADA would go to actually buy real land/homes which New Pavia had as an asset. And those holding DEEDs to New Pavia had a right real-world assets held by the community. Based on the person's DEEDs they held dividends would be sent to your wallet as NEXO does now with their earning.  
  
So people buying virtual land in New Pavia would actually be investing in their future and the ADA they spent in-game would creating real-world value for them if they learned to hold their DEEDs.

13/Aug/20 8:49 PM,316119,92,Umed--[SKY] SkyLight Pool,"@shapiro21  thanks for your feedback. yes hydra could introduce some diversification in terms of value-added services. The pools can decide to run or not those hydra channels, which are high-throughput heads that could facilitate transactions/commerce that require those volumes.

What you are describing with a portfolio of tokens though will probably run on the main chain and here SPOs won't have any choice but support those transactions/tokens. Their choice could be to accumulate those funds and provide their stakeholders with additional rewards (if they actually go up) or not take a risk and just dump them in the market as they pose a risk to their earnings.

Either way, this functionality isn't even in the design stage and from my understanding of Duncan, supporting transaction in native tokens is an extremely hard problem to solve.... we may not see it in the foreseeable future.

  

In the meantime we need to have a mechanism that looks beyond tokens and sources value from outside the ecosystem. For example: SkyLight Pool will offer free research on Cardano and anything that will live on Cardano (tokens, smart contracts, etc.) so its stakeholders can understand the fundamental nature of those assets before making any decision to buy them.

Another pool could grant its stakeholders exclusive rights to premium features of its app (Pegasus stakepool comes to mind).

13/Aug/20 6:37 PM,316119,92,shapiro21,"From my understanding of how hydra works, it seems to me that hydra will automatically create a second dimension of value for stake pools. The way I understand it, every hydra channel is dedicated to a specific token. So if there is a stake pool with 5 hydra channels: 3 could be dedicated to ADA and the other two could be dedicated to two different native tokens on cardano. In this scenario, a delegator picking this pool isn't just maximizing his ADA profits; he is also maximizing which native tokens he wants to invest in. I should add this assumes the rewards are paid in the native tokens.

In this context, stake pools naturally become investment portfolios for delegators to pick from. Maybe I decide to run 6 ADA channels for my pool while SKY pool decides to have 2 dedicated to ADA, 2 dedicated to a music streaming dapp, and 2 dedicated to a VR game dapp. In this situation, even if my pool has lower fees than yours, delegators may still pick your pool to have a diversified investment.

I could be wrong about how hydra works but if this is correct, a second dimension will be added automatically by hydra. Perhaps pooltool.io can just be used for people to read up on which channels pools are running.

The geographic diversity could also organically follow from this in the case that delegators want to invest abroad. Assuming two equally performing stake pools but one is in the US and one is in Ethiopia, if they both are dedicated to Ethiopian tokens, which would you pick? In this case where they are equally reliable pools, I would choose the one in Ethiopia because they actually have boots on the ground. They actually know what the day to day is like.

13/Aug/20 5:57 PM,316119,92,Umed--[SKY] SkyLight Pool,"@robgreig  from my conversations with Lars, there aren't any technical means to achieve decentralization beyond what exists now, which makes this issue even more urgent.

The only way to achieve geographic diversity is to introduce a second layer of metrics and value added services that aren't uniform and cater to public with differing priorities.

To be clear, performance and costs will still remain as primary metrics for pools but value-added services will add to the richness of offering, attract additional demand beyond just ADA rewards and alleviate pressure on treasury to fund some initiatives. Pools can become self-sustaining economic units with their own source of funding and could be wildly successful at that.",NO
13/Aug/20 5:52 PM,316119,92,Umed--[SKY] SkyLight Pool,"@workshopmaybe  thank you for your comment. You raise a good question! I like to think about the issue in terms of scenarios.

Scenario 1: we don't do anything, which means that stake pool services will be commoditized and our entire pool fleet will eventually migrate to the cheapest possible infrastructure run by 2-3 companies (offering EUR6 vps).

While it may seem like a rational decision by the market (to maximize returns) such an outcome actually increases the risk for the entire ecosystem, such that these 2-3 companies could effectively control the Cardano's network.

Scenario 2: We will create avenues for pools to offer value added services for their stakeholders such that their increased costs are eventually more than justified by the value the stakeholders will extract from becoming automatic subscriber to these services.

In scenario 1 you risk your entire infrastructure on a technical level, meaning anything built on top will be at a huge risk. Decentralization won't exist and we are unlikely to attract talent and adoption because we can't guarantee security/uptime.

In scenario 2 you create economic incentives to push for geographic and technical decentralization by introducing additional dimensions for pool evaluation. These will ultimately lead to keeping Cardano itself decentralized even though access to information to make staking decisions could be centralized.  

To counter the urge for one entity to control all information flow we have to consider alignment of interests. Such a platform will operate as a business and will only benefit if stake pools were uncensored in their quest to create value. Think about it as a market place. We provide the infrastructure and the tools for stakehoders to make the decisions. The more SPOs and stakeholders join, the more diverse their offerings and interaction the better it will be for the business and the ecosystem.  

That said, we can thing of various feedback loops with checks and balances to keep us aligned with the spirit of decentralization. To achieve that we could completely open-source our methodologies and form governance structures that will oversee our analytical frameworks.",NO

We can choose whether or not to take an SPO's word for that, but for now there's no accountability. Soon that will change, and I think that individual pool governance can be a great way to help people understand the broader power of Cardano. We might even draw the analogy that governing a stake pool is like running for city council, while being a delegated expert in Voltaire is like running for parliament.

I also like how your idea gets at variety: there can be different stake pools that are trying to accomplish different things. ""This"" pool is a great source of start-up funding, while ""that"" pool is a great network if you're into saving endangered species, and so on. All the while, non-operators will see the central role that pools play in the network.

What ideas do you have for on-boarding potential delegators to this sort of model?

""Hey, I work with personal data and pay a lot per month to maintain it. I think blockchain could be a big boost. If you can figure out how to implement this, please reach out to me with your proposal on how to build it and how much money you would be willing to build it for. If I like your idea, we can start right away and you can work remotely!""  

This post would entice any developer with an idea to reach out to you. They would effectively be bidding on the project. So you get solutions and you get developers competing.

If you don't want to hire someone but you do have a problem and want solutions, instead you could post something like:

""Hey I work with personal data and pay a lot per month to maintain it. I think blockchain could be a big boost. However, I'm struggling with (insert problem). I have 1,000 ADA in a smart contract with the ID 1234567 (so you can verify). The smart contract only allows the funds to go to a developer on this platform. If your solution works, the smart contract will send you the rewards. Please reach out with your proposed solution.""

This would also have developers competing to make a quick 1,000 ADA and results in community problem solving. I think the smart contract is critical to incentivize responses. InnoCentive literally acts like the smart contract which is why their model works.

Please let me know if you see any issue with this.",NO
13/Aug/20 1:31 PM,316015,56,shapiro21,"@wunderbaer  The short answer is I actually don't think this is an issue because it would not be in the best interest for the developer but hear me out. The biggest reason against this concern is that blockchain is meant to get rid of the middle man. Imagine two blockchains that do the same thing. One of them only has the minimum fees for the necessary transactions while the other has extra fees so that the creator can profit from it. The first blockchain would be significantly cheaper than the second. You don't even need to consider how the average cost of living per year is several orders of mangitude greater than what only paying the minimum fees would yield. In other words, there is no profit in the developer stealing your idea and building the dapp. They would put in all of the upfront costs and get nothing in the end. Blockchain tech is supposed to stop people like Mark Zuckerberg from profitng off of you using a public platform. The only people who will profit are the stake pool operators.  

Another reason is less important but I think is still significant. It continues with how a dapp is meant to be a public utility. Let's say a developer did steal your idea to build the dapp without you. Does it matter? Unless the dapp was built to be a private utility, you would be able to use it which means you got the functionality for free because they stole your idea. If they did build it as a private dapp, well then there is still a huge demand for a public version. Most people in the world are poor. You would add a tremendous amount of demand by building a public version. You could even bring entire markets into the ecosystem. In addition, from what I understand, the treasury is meant to fund applications that would benefit everyone, not fund a private venture. So by teaming up with you, you and the developer could be able to build it on Cardano's dime. If the developer went for the funds without you, it would likely only get funded if it is a public dapp, which means the end result is free for you.  

The last reason is simpler. If you are an entrepreneur who already has a business and a customer base and now wants to implement blockchain to help, what incentive would a developer have in stealing your idea? They would then also need to build the business and customer base up from scratch. Anyone who has ever tried to start a business knows this is extremely difficult and unprofitable for a long time. It is soooo much better for the developer to work for you at a constant salary.

I do think there will be idea stealing but because of the reasons stated above, I don't think it will happen anywhere often enough to be a real issue. I hope this made sense. If you disagree, please let me know why. I should stress that this platform would be meant for blockchain development, not typical apps.",NO

13/Aug/20 12:36 PM,316074,77,steven.j.moody,"Pools would be able to have their own internal treasury to fund things like promotion of the pool, internal jobs, internal smart contracts.

For example, a pool may specialise as an investment focused pool. Where a % of pool tax goes into long term investments, and another % into a trading pool. Other pool members could submit trade ideas in smart contract form. An internal vote would occur and a smart contract trade executed. This pool for example may employ a market analyst. Paid in ADA. I think we can create ADA paid jobs within the stakepools.

Other pools may evolve into political structures within the ecosystem lobbying for parameter changes etc.

Others may build an internal voting system and combine with other similar pools to form a human backed oracle service.

I expect we would see pool alliances evolve and even interpool attacks.
