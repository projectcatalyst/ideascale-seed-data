04/Jan/21 12:08 PM,323939,1804,Franco,"@sailguy  thanks for taking the time to reach out, i think most of these questions have already been address but i'll go ahead an address them directly

1\. If you look at the referenced links more than ~50% of cats and dogs can't be reunited by microchipping services due to poor record keeping, there are a number of reasons for this but mostly it's accessibility, be it from an ease of use perspective, registry competency or even a lack of basic capability. Some services are better than others and of course in most places these services don't even exist, this pet registry solution is accessible everywhere and in places microchipping exists it's cheaper, easier, more accessible and doesn't rely on anything else but the owner, not special equipment, private database and specialised personnel.  

2\. Printing a QR code on paper and having it laminated can be done quite easily and cheaply by just about anyone, there is no need for anything high tech. However should users want something a little more premium we'll be able to provide a number of cost effective solutions be it laser printed plastic or metal dog tags to a very affordable plastic sealable dog tag that a printed QR code can be inserted into.

3\. Scanning the QR code simply sends the user to the pet registry website, not app needs to be installed, the service is simply accesssed through a browser. When the website loads geolocation is done on the device, permission is not required but allowing the request will greatly increase accuracy. Keep in mind this is more of a fail safe should the rescuer for whatever reason decide not to continue to reach out to the pet owner. That way if all the potential resucer does is scan the QR code the pet owner still has something to go off.

4\. All information is encrypted on the blockchain however the QR is the private key to that information so users should be mindful of what information they supply and when. There is no need to place anything sensitive on the blockchain, remember should your pet ever get lost the information can be easily and instantly updated. For example a message of where the pet was lost and a local phone or address to facilitate the rescuse, the pet could be lost anywhere, even when you are on holidays, microchipping services are unlikely to help in such a situation.",NO

19/Dec/20 6:16 PM,323939,1804,Rick W.,"Hi,

I love your idea and think it has a massively bigger impact than most realize as this same system can be used to attach to ANY item so if lost, it could be scanned to identify the owner.

I do have some questions about the current iteration, which I also think could get lots of traction, as described by your proposal:

1\. You mention that microchipped pets, if lost, cannot have their contact information updated, after the pet is lost. I believe this is incorrect. My 3 dogs, here in the US, can have their information updated online at anytime, before during or after the pet is lost. This may not be universal for all chips, but it is certainly common to be able to do here. Although the chip costs money and it does still require special equipment to scan, there is no monthly fee required to keep your information updated remotely or change it even after the fact. It would be good to clarify this point in your materials.

2\. You mention that the QR code can be printed at home (or ordered). I'm a bit confused how the average individual would print a QR code for this purpose. Unless they have a 3D printer, it's gonna come out on paper and how would you attach this to a pet and have long term durability? This solution is designed to be low cost, so knowing how you'd DIY it at home is important to keeping it low cost. Can you elaborate on how you envision this to be done at home properly at low cost anywhere in the world?

3\. Can you explain what happens when somebody finds the pet and scans the QR code? Do they need the app? Does the scanner person who is scanning your pet's QR code need to give permission for their location to be revealed? If they don't give permission for their location to be revealed, is this a limitation of the service? If they don't need to give permission, how are you able to override the scanner's ability to refuse revealing their location?

4\. Let's assume I add this QR code to my dog's collar, who resides in my yard. Let's assume he is a very friendly dog. What stops a stranger from scanning that QR code at the edge of my property, or in a dog park, to gain my contact information and details about the dog's owner nefariously?

Forgive me if these questions have already been asked, but in my quick search, I didn't see them. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this and I'm excited to see your proposal.

Warm regards,

16/Dec/20 7:09 AM,322288,1501,Jeronimo Backes,"@anatana  Scope of fund2 was to attract businesses to the ecosystem which in my understanding fits with the purpose of enabling online retailers to exchange goods for ADA. As for the wallet, that's something that integrates with the e-commerce solution, it does have general purpose features like daedalus/yoroi, but it also has purpose-specific features that will never be incorporated into the official wallets, such as displaying purchase information to the seller or the consumers. You can't expect the official wallets to add support for specific use cases that are not entirely related to the blockchain itself (product details for example, will come from the online stores).",NO

Thanks a lot for the feedback and support!

To answer your questions, as we can't edit the proposal anymore, we add a little description of the team experience a few weeks ago. You can find it as an image. ☺️

Regarding the fact we would like to host devs in an office and not remotely is to be able to provide them with the needed infrastructure they will need (I.e.stable electricity and Internet). As you probably know, network stability isn't really good in Africa and It would be easier to for to keep the highest uptime if we maintain most of it.

Hope this answer most of your concerns.

14/Dec/20 3:14 AM,322205,1452,Wade Ison,"Very detailed proposal. Its obvious you've put a lot of thought and effort into the plan with a solid mission and purpose. The services ABCD plans to provide seem very broad with: Developer Training and skills development, Business Assistance, and Facility-Based Services which is great for long term aspirational targets but for the initial stages of building the organization, does it make more sense to focus on a smaller set of services that provide the best impact and ROI for the funds you're seeking? It also seems a lot of the costs are infrastructure related, why not implement more of a virtual approach to services by utilizing tech like WebEx or Zoom to avoid those costs? Why can't these services be delivered without the expense of a brick/mortar center? Also your proposal should include in depth details on the experience and qualifications of the ABCD team that will be delivering the types of services included in your proposal. Thank you for submitting, I'm personally in love with the idea!",NO
11/Dec/20 7:31 AM,323787,1770,Phil Lewis,"Hi All

I will be withdrawing this proposal (just waiting for the Admin to reply to me about how I close it) as it does not appear to have sparked any interest from the community.

While I think that one answer to the question ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"" is to demonstrate to them that there are community based groups such as the CCC (and its focus committees) driving initiatives that are in their best interest, it doesn't appear like the community agrees. Which is OK I guess.

I was hoping that it was time to become less reliant on the original 3 entities (IOG, Emurgo and the Cardano Foundation) to be responsible for driving the changes that developers and entrepreneurs will be looking for, but maybe as the project matures more there will be other opportunities to re-introduce community based steering groups like this.

4\. The proposal makes ADA more accessible but doesn't mention anything about bringing new developers or entrepreneurs to the ecosystem - **BT Comment: There are hundreds of Bitcoin ATM operators (entrepreneurs)that could potentially be brought into the ecosystem and introduced to ADA. It also brings in developers for wallet and exchanges that support ADA**

5\. This proposal does not address the challenge in any way. If this were to be released as open source, then maybe it would be less of a free integration point for their product - **BT Comment: It is and will be open source. We are doing this to enhance ADA, not as a closed source project.**

++Feasibility++

1\. Not in alignment with Fund 2, but an interesting proposal. Consider resubmission in later rounds. BT: I don't see how this is not in alignment.

**summary**

I need to express more of my experience creating ERP tools and knowledge about blockchain technology to be more impactful.

  

  
**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**  

**feedback to the reviewer.**The review score is given to improve reviewers for future rounds.

G = Good Review  
B = Bad Review

1.B You said my proposal is informative, could you tell for example, what made it informative?  

2.B I agree that the overall idea is very impactful, but am going at it from the right angle to implement it correctly?

3.G You are skeptical about using blockchain for ERP platforms and have it open-sourced.  
I think integrating or building business operations on the blockchain is going to be a very large movement in the coming years. Users and investors demand transparency and audibility. We can have smart contracts that enforce contracts automatically. This makes it transparent and automates the process.  
Additionally, blockchain is immutable by nature, which means you don't have to worry about broken or corrupted records. Don't even start me with the fact of the security of data in a blockchain.  
As for choosing to make it open-source is because of my own idealism. Together we will have a cascading network effect.

4.G Open-source + Cardano + ERP. Welcome to cardano.erp.com to build your business.

5.B What do you mean by funding Cardano development are you talking about this proposal idea?

6-13.G I understand I must improve the roadmap even further by explaining strategy on how to leverage Cardano.  
However, I disagree that putting together a team does not encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build apps on Cardano. Not only I invite and incentivize developers to build dapps with me I will am potentially encouraging other entrepreneurs to also compete on the same open-source market to sell their own solutions.

14.B You are saying that I do not directly address the numbers of developers I hope to attract.  
Actually, I did say that two is a good start for the end of the 6th week.

15.G You are absolutely right, it can not be done alone. The goal of this current proposal is to document a solid plan for minimum viable products that already use the Cardano network. But I just have a feeling something like this might get huge attraction if done through Cardano like governance.

16.B You say important words: ""Bridges drive adoption"", but unfortunately I don't feel like it's constructive feedback.

17.G Actually you are right on, this is a 6week proposal where the first goal is to research and create documentation on how to build ERP dapps on Cardano. Well, I would be skeptical too before handing money to Project Manger who only has an idea, but no plan to execute on.  
Yes, I do not have experience having my own team, but what I do have is experience writing documentation and hiring freelancers to certain tasks for the project. With this funding, I practically continue to do my day job, except now I do it for everyone and add blockchain into the equation.

18.G I did not think about talking about the experience I have had building ERP tools. The relevant experience section was 140 characters long I only gave an overview of my experience.  
You are right that it takes a lot of time for an individual to get a good grasp of different types of business sectors (supply chain, finance, storage, Salesforce, etc.) The way I work is, I go to the specialist and listen to what bothers them in the job process they are doing. I map down the workflow and propose solutions to how I could remove or ease their problems. I do not have to have an extensive understanding of why something is done the way it's done. I can be curious, but mostly there are always good reasons. Regarding my experience.  
I have worked in a substation factory, where I made developments in production, material master, finance, warehouse, and sales. Right now I am working in a sales and distribution company, where I am also responsible for the information system.

19.G Duly noted, the first problem to solve here is to make it easier for an entrepreneur to understand what tooling they need in order to build their business on the blockchain. I found this information hard to find, so I start from here and spend my time doing the research and documentation to move forward.  

20.B You are stating facts that what I said like: ""The proposer does not have relevant marketing experience. They propose contracting consulting work to choose a tech stack. The proposer has submitted another proposal to develop an open-source multiplayer game engine."" I already know that? How is that feedback?  
In addition, you write that I state I have partners ready to integrate on the platform, which is incorrect",NO

04/Nov/20 7:31 PM,323861,1792,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  Im having a hard time to understand how this proposal address the challenge, it should be clear how they will use this implementation to bring more developers and entrepreneurs.
2.  The fundamental challenge is to encourage devs and entrepreneurs to build dapps and businesses on Cardano. If accepted, this proposal partially addresses the challenge in that it could result in the addition of a small team to build out the MVP and result in demonstration of a real world use case for Cardano and related products such as PRISM. Outside of developing this product however, there seems to be little benefit to the greater Cardano community in terms of encouraging devs and other businesses to build on Cardano.
3.  Funding a rewrite of a cosplay art commerce platform on top of Cardano is one way of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
4.  This business already wants to build on Cardano. Fund2 is not the right fund for them as it will not bring more entrepreneurs to the eco-system. This proposal should be resubmitted in a future fund.
5.  ""I have no idea how the project translates its focus onto dFund2 theme that holds:
6.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""
7.  Very off topic for Fund 2. Consider re-submission in later funding rounds.

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  The plan seems to require many Cardano features that simply are not available yet. As such, I think that some key portions of the project will not be able to be completed as a deliverable.
2.  We need specific details about the road map, seams too generic, there is no clear sense of what can be done with the budge to each milestone.
3.  ""Successfully replatforming DealersDen to link buyers and sellers on the blockchain is very feasible, particularly when the project sponsors have the requisite business expertise and a solid understanding of the use case. What is unclear in this proposal is:
4.  1.) The requirement for a Dealers Den token tied to USD. It is unclear why this token is needed or how a transaction between parties would work. Would it not be easier to simply use ADA or a colored coin for transactions(you could show the equivalent USD amount in the transaction metadata) and incorporate a smart contract for managing the deposit/transfer/return of funds?
5.  2) The role of the administrator does not seem to be fully flushed out. Where does the trustless nature of using blockchain end and the adjudication/control of the mechanism by the administrator begin?
6.  The steps toward a MVP are outlined but there are no effort estimates provided, technologies or skillsets identified. Since an initial product already exists, this proposal would be stronger with more detailed use cases identified and a plan for resource allocation with a high level timeline. 250,000 ADA at current prices seems like enough for a POC but not a MVP.
7.  ""
8.  The proposer manages The Dealer's Den. They propose hiring developers to redevelop the platform using Cardano solutions, many of which are currently unavailable.
9.  The requested budget seems low given the amount of R&D required. Token and prism are not ready yet, so it's too early to tell how this could work.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Im having a hard time to understand how this proposal address the challenge, it should be clear how they will use this implementation to bring more developers and entrepreneurs.
2.  The fundamental challenge is to encourage devs and entrepreneurs to build dapps and businesses on Cardano. If accepted, this proposal partially addresses the challenge in that it could result in the addition of a small team to build out the MVP and result in demonstration of a real world use case for Cardano and related products such as PRISM. Outside of developing this product however, there seems to be little benefit to the greater Cardano community in terms of encouraging devs and other businesses to build on Cardano.
3.  Funding a rewrite of a cosplay art commerce platform on top of Cardano is one way of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
4.  This business already wants to build on Cardano. Fund2 is not the right fund for them as it will not bring more entrepreneurs to the eco-system. This proposal should be resubmitted in a future fund.
5.  ""I have no idea how the project translates its focus onto dFund2 theme that holds:
6.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""
7.  Very off topic for Fund 2. Consider re-submission in later funding rounds.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  The plan seems to require many Cardano features that simply are not available yet. As such, I think that some key portions of the project will not be able to be completed as a deliverable.
2.  We need specific details about the road map, seams too generic, there is no clear sense of what can be done with the budge to each milestone.
3.  ""Successfully replatforming DealersDen to link buyers and sellers on the blockchain is very feasible, particularly when the project sponsors have the requisite business expertise and a solid understanding of the use case. What is unclear in this proposal is:
4.  1.) The requirement for a Dealers Den token tied to USD. It is unclear why this token is needed or how a transaction between parties would work. Would it not be easier to simply use ADA or a colored coin for transactions(you could show the equivalent USD amount in the transaction metadata) and incorporate a smart contract for managing the deposit/transfer/return of funds?
5.  2) The role of the administrator does not seem to be fully flushed out. Where does the trustless nature of using blockchain end and the adjudication/control of the mechanism by the administrator begin?
6.  The steps toward a MVP are outlined but there are no effort estimates provided, technologies or skillsets identified. Since an initial product already exists, this proposal would be stronger with more detailed use cases identified and a plan for resource allocation with a high level timeline. 250,000 ADA at current prices seems like enough for a POC but not a MVP.
7.  ""
8.  The proposer manages The Dealer's Den. They propose hiring developers to redevelop the platform using Cardano solutions, many of which are currently unavailable.
9.  The requested budget seems low given the amount of R&D required. Token and prism are not ready yet, so it's too early to tell how this could work.
10.  I would have loved to learn more about people behind this project. LinkedIn profiles, etc. To see the experience credibility, etc. It is difficult to do so with a proxy product only.
11.  ""It is possible that they could re-platform within 6 months, but there is substantial technical detail missing from their plan that would lend credibility to the idea that the team knows how to do this on the blockchain.
12.  I would recommend you find a development partner and flesh out the implementation plan in the 'Core Build' block before resubmission in a later round.""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  No, it lacks information in how will address the challenge.
2.  The proposal lacks sufficient information to assess feasibility, particularly with respect to showcasing the use of ADA and the Cardano blockchain.
3.  Business growth and development expansion projections would be useful for impact assessment.
4.  A developer perspective is missing, unrelated to current challenge.
5.  ""Project doesn't seem to address budgetary requirements in appropriate level of depth beyond one grand value. It is difficult to 'guess' what the funds are going to be used for/allocated to. Hence, unable to determine about its effects. More information on that front would be viable.

04/Nov/20 7:26 PM,323886,1795,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  RINA seems to be a go for the team but Cardano/IOG releasing Ouroboros over RINA seems in question.
2.  This proposal is not addressing the challenge, not directly expressed in this proposal. RINA its not working today on cardano and will not be in the next 6 months.
3.  A video with more information about you and what you plan to implement id s great idea
4.  Improving Cardano performance would make transactions and building on Cardano cheaper. Funding Ouroboros over RINA is one way of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
5.  ""I am having troubles making the connection between proposal itself and:
6.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
7.  I understand and can appreciate the effort - but it seems to be entirely out of scope? Unless, the mission statement would be revised to reflect this effort. ""
8.  This is off topic for Fund 2. Given the technically interesting nature of the work I've bumped to at least give 2/5 here though, since there's a chance it might attract developers to the platform.
9.  The problem that the limitations of the TCP / IP protocol imposes in the future of Cardano's blockchain transactions is something that should be studied and solved, however this is an inherent limitation of the protocol and I think it is more prudent that this proposal be left for later funds since the proposal to create a proof of concept does not indicate to have a relevant impact for the purpose of fund2 in the short term,
10.  ""This is an important project that does need support. The proposal does not address how it will attract devs and businesses to Cardano in the next 6 months.
11.  ""
12.  Project is interesting but doesnt really/completely address the challenge. Attracting devs and entrepreneurs would eventually occurs but indirectly just by providing a better network performance and stability to all cardano stakeholders
13.  The team is technically dedicated and experienced with RINA lab work already but Cardano relay nodes talking to native RINA staking nodes without an IP SHIM, but rather over native RINA does not appear solved.
14.  The team seams strong and capable but the proposal is not clear about the road map and where the funds will be used. What will be the milestones?

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  Very well laid out plan
2.  The proposer represents the RINA Users Group which is currently working with a communications service provider in Japan.
3.  ""Unable to determine experience/validity with finality under experience section.
4.  """"Our sponsor is an innovative Japanese communications service provider currently deploying and experimenting with RINA.""""
5.  Also would be useful to include linked in profiles of people involved to establish that experience validity.
6.  If it wouldn't be for the podcast video - I would have had hard time addressing these issues.""
7.  Given the plan is to run a limited 'proof of concept' implementation with a technically experienced team it seems there is a high degree of probability that the proposal would succeed in learning something useful in this space.
8.  ""It was mentioned that the project will have a sponsor, GLBBJapan, which is already implementing and testing with RINA. The experiences of the people involved in the project were not mentioned nor how many people will participate in the project.
9.  Some parameters / indicators have been placed that indicate some objectives of the project, but there is no description of roadmap or detailed plan that allows to better evaluate the project. A detailed budget has not been described, making it difficult to assess the feasibility of the project.""
10.  ""This proposal team is highly skilled and very capable. The project seems like a high risk/high reward sort of project. I do not feel qualified to assess the likelihood of successful implementation.
11.  Would it be possible for the proposal to present progress or previous experiment successes, which would allow a typical voter to have some sense of the likelihood of success?""
12.  ""Being not expert of the topic (networking architecture/topolgy) it is quite difficult to judge the quality of the team.
13.  I will therefore just judge the overall impression left by the proposers. They seems technically competent and domain experts but some key informations are missing regarding the production plan and the actual team members curriculums.
14.  One extra point is that after reading about Rina networking layer, it looks like a topic for a core team work (iohk or any internal team). No problem to outsource tech most of the time, but when topic is as sensitive as network layer, it looks like it should be done with as much care and risk aversion as possible.
15.  Team will have to prove their absolute technical expertise in order to get their hands on Cardano network layer.""
16.  It appears a worthy challenge and feasible.
17.  No, this proposal need improvement and would be interesting a close relationship with IOG to our community be able to understand what can be done in relation to Cardano Network.
18.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, and credentials. Success metrics would be useful for impact assessment.
19.  ""No attempt to determine budgetary requirements beyond the grand value. That gives me no confidence in understanding what the funds would be used for exactly and their allocation.
20.  And hence unable to determine return on intention here. Unfortunately, as mentioned in the first comment - unable to see how it connects with the theme of the challenge itself.
21.  I appreciate the project at large and what it tries to achieve. But more effort would be required to make that connection with the theme challenge.""

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  ""The proposal could have been better written to draw on external verifiable sources, such as linkedin profiles for the tech team, whitepapers for background specs etc.
2.  As it stands, this proposal seems to have numerous assumptions about the stakeholders it is pitching to and their background familiarity with the tech.""
3.  ""As there is no roadmap or detailed plan or budget, it is not possible to assess the feasibility of the project. The proposal needs to be refined and better detailed.
4.  There is no significant indication of impact on the objective of fund2, but this proposal is important for Cardano. I suggest that the proposal be refined and better detailed so that the community can have better conditions to understand and evaluate the project.""
5.  There is no information provided about how this proposal addresses the challenge. Assessing this without success metrics to measure, is very difficult.
6.  ""if proposer could provide a more detailed production plan, it would help dramatically to know how the budget would be spent. at the moment, we just know that project will be split in two parts spread over Fund2 and Fund3.
7.  Second point, considering the complexity of the topic, the budget looks a bit underestimated according to the general market price of best experts in network architectures""

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  The idea could help with the fund2 challenge. But looking at it seriously from the business perspective, there are already many publishing platforms out there, also with cryptotokens incentives, like https://www.publish0x.com/ and they struggle to get traction. I'm not sure this proposal can achieve any results in 6 months time.
2.  If implemented, how would this attract developers and entrepreneurs? Which kind?
3.  Its great that we have developers trying to build on cardano, but this proposal don't address the challenge of bringing more developers and business to the ecosystem. If this project was turned in a demo tutorial would be great.
4.  Funding the development of a digital publishing app may not be the best way to encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
5.  ""Even though I think the idea is rather interesting and can have a significant impact on the development of Cardano ecosystem personally I don't think this particular proposal really addresses the Fund2 challenge statement of attracting developers to the ecosystem.
6.  Most likely such initiatives will be more suitable for future funds, when the statement/goal will be broader and we will have enough funds to allocate to even more experiments. ""
7.  Too indirect, incentivized blogs would not attract devs or businesses more than standard blogs or articles.
8.  It wasn'ot clear why this project needs to use a blockchain, the proposer needs to explain the reasons why he wants to create and use tokens in this project. Furthermore, there is no indication of how this will solve the fund2 challenge.
9.  ""Proposal doesn't make an apparent connection with the theme fund:
10.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""
11.  ""The challenge is addressed so far as that the proposal intends to build a Dapp. It's limited to that one project and getting more Dapp builders and businesses into Cardano would seemingly be more of a side effect.
12.  It would be helpful if the challenge goal would be addressed more clearly. As I understand the proposal to have a proof of concept as a target, I see the likelyness of it attracting more businesses and developers to Cardano in 6 months as relatively low.""
13.  Very off topic for Fund 2.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Sounds like a really interesting app which I would use but it does not directly address the challenges of Fund2. With a bit more planning and detail provided, it may be suitable for a future fund.
2.  No plan for getting more businesses to build on Cardano
3.  A single developer could build a publishing platform, but I doubt they can market it and make it stand out from other publishing platforms.
4.  Can you please mention relevant references
5.  More details about the plan, road map and sope are needed.
6.  The proposer claims to have relevant full stack development experience. There is no customer acquisition plan, nor justification of an app token over just ada.
7.  ""I think a lot more thought needs to be put in this proposal. Think of what and how users will engage, how can we incentives good behaviour and minimise negative interactions like incorrect information, lies, trolling, toxic engagements, spam, scams and so on.
8.  I listed a few more questions and things to think about in the next question in assesment.
9.  I definitely think the idea is worth exploring but we need significantly more information and attention put into it. Also I feel this initiative if it's well thought out would require more funding than 38k ADA and probably a larger team with a much broader set of skills and experience.""
10.  Experience is claimed but no link to external achievements was given.
11.  The proposer is a full stack developer, but there are no details on how much experience he has as a developer or on previous projects. There is no detail on how the project will fulfill its objective, as the objective is very vague and there is no clarity in the proposal in general. It was not detailed how the budget will be allocated or the reasons for a budget of 38,000 ADAs.
12.  Cannot establish relevant experience/credibility with the information provided.
13.  ""There is experience in App building and the proposal is seemingly limited to the proof of concept so far.
14.  As the idea is not developed very far, this carries the risk that during implementation unconsidered problems arise.
15.  It would help if the milestones would be described in more detail and how those are expected to be reached.""
16.  There is no plan of substance here. Just an idea.
17.  Related but unsubstantiated experience cited. Would have been nice to see some prior work examples and a simple UI design. No budget breakdown.
18.  Vague plan and no dApp experience.
19.  The author hasn't updated the proposal as requested in the comments.
20.  Which part will be implemented within the 6 months timeline?
21.  No this proposal is not targeting the challenge properly.
22.  The proposal does not include a roadmap, milestones, credentials, and success metrics. Past work on digital publisher apps would be useful for feasibility assessment. Business growth and development expansion projections would be useful for impact assessment.
23.  ""I think your idea needs refinement, significantly more detail around incentivising high quality articles and user engagement by providing actual scenarios and examples. For example:

\- how do tokens get distributed to users and creators?  
\- how can the blog protect against sybil attacks where one can create a lot of accounts and generate low quality interactions just to get a lot of tokens which then floods the market lowering the value of the token and entire platform?  
\- how can users self manage by engaging with the articles how can surface good posts?  
\- what will be the issuance of the token?  
\- how can the token accrue value? Without value there's low incentive for users to even create articles.  
\- what are the personas we needed in such a system to increase the chances of success and adoption? ""  

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  This an idea in its infancy on a very difficult topic. No research was provided on the proposed possible models…
2.  ""There are no details of the steps included in the roadmap or dates for the established goals.
3.  There is no clear definition of how this project will achieve its goals, as the goals are very vague.
4.  The budget was not detailed in any way, making it difficult to assess the need for the requested amount.""
5.  Proposal lacks appropriate level of depth to be able to determine its feasibility.
6.  ""There are only rough milestones, which don't offer much detail about the timeline in or how to determine that they are reached.
7.  It would help if there was an expected cost breakdown to assess the legitimacy of the amount of funds requested. I would encourage to give information about expected time effort, hourly rate and other costs to be covered by the fund e.g. infrastructure.""

1.  The proposal don't address in a specific way how they will approach to capture more devs and entrepreneurs to the ecosystem.
2.  ""The proposal is one of many offering marketing and promotion through digital channels.
3.  It does not directly address the Fund2 challenge.""
4.  This idea really fits with the proposal. Video's about awareness, smart contracts and Cardano in general would create attention. Attention is what we need right now.
5.  The drive to contribute is obvious , how about some examples
6.  Informational videos released weekly would increase public awareness. However, there are a few channels that do this already, and there is no differentiating factor for this proposal. It seems unlikely that another channel would encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
7.  Various podcasts would bring more awareness but the main goals of the podcast do not seem to directly address the challenge. Trading is mentioned and speculation is outside of the current challenge.
8.  ""The proposer indicated that the idea is to finance a general purpose YouTube channel that brings news and technical analysis about Cardano.
9.  I love the idea of having more content creators at Cardano and I think we can help finance some with the treasury, if they present proposals that bring some return that the community finds interesting. However, it has not been described how this proposal should assist in solving the fund2 challenge.""
10.  Generally, educational and information videos would address the challenge of Fund2 but more specifics required. No measurable metrics provided to assess ROI.
11.  ""I can see the value of education but this proposal is too shallow at the moment to be considered seriously for this round. It needs more information on how exactly it would make the primary goal a thing.
12.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""
13.  ""The proposal mainly targets increasing the audience of Cardano, not directly Dapp builders. It would be helpful if the proposal would point out in which way developers and entrepreneurs would be more encouraged to build Dapps on Cardano this way.
14.  This might be a good proposal with some refurbish for future fund challenges.""
15.  Largely off topic for Fund 2 and there are plenty of pre-existing video channels covering generic Cardano news. The chance this new channel would draw in devs and/or entrepreneurs seems very low.
16.  Not that relevant for getting developers and new businesses onboarded on Cardano

4.  There is only basic information about the proposer with no proof of experience.""
5.  Looking at your experience you see qualified to do the job. But it would be nice if you can add some examples of your editing skills. Your budget looks a bit strange to me. You are asking for 25k ADA but I dont know how many episodes you are gonna make, etc.
6.  What type of videos sets you aside from everyone els ?

12.  Unable to determine legitimacy of experience/identity.
13.  The is little substance to this proposal to assess
14.  Relevant experience and simple product
15.  This proposal don't contain substantial information, like scope of the videos and timeline for execution.
16.  ""Since there are many similar proposals by proposers with better track record and samples, there is no logic to award the funding.

19.  You have a plan, but I need a bit more information. What is your specific road-map, KPI's, budget, do you need materials, expenses, etc.
20.  Supply more details on how you plan to drive adoption
21.  The proposal does not include credentials, and success metrics. Past work on informational videos would be useful for feasibility assessment.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  The proposal is trying to spread the word about Cardano, directly and indirectly reaching developers. They are aware of the need for users that will in turn attract developers
2.  The budget is an alternative source of funding for a Cardano portal. A Cardano portal would increase public awareness. A more targeted approach would deliver higher ROI in addressing the challenge in encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
3.  I'm fully supportive about this proposal but this not addresses the challenge. We don't have any strategic plan to attract developer or entrepreneurs in the short term.
4.  There are already several informative and educational communication channels that address various aspects of Cardano, it isn't clear what differentiates this proposal in relation to the diversity of content that is published daily by the community, IOG, Emurgo and CF. It is important that the community can understand the additional impact that this proposal can have for the purpose of fund2.
5.  The proposal does not aim to attract developers to Cardano in the near, rather, it will target general promotion of Cardano ecosystem and related projects.
6.  ""I would have appreciated more effort to focus on answering the question of :
7.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
8.  It would be easy enough just to add that line of reasoning into the proposal itself. That would give more confidence in author's understanding what the goal of this particular dFund2 round is.
9.  I understand that articles and education is important - but I shouldn't be making these conclusions in my head only. Should be spelled out in the proposal itself. :)
10.  ""
11.  Very off topic for Fund 2.
12.  ""The proposal does not describe how it addresses the challenge. Great content may very well attract developers and businesses to build on Cardano. This challenge asks that we define the metrics by which success is judged.
13.  The proposer could have provided information about the demographics of their current content consumer, and related the anticipated increase based on those demographics and expected increase of readership through the proposed changes. This would have provided a way to assess efficacy.""
14.  Site is already active with plenty of content. Experience of the team is visible through the proposal and through the article quality on site
15.  The proposer represents CardanoJournal.com and Cardanians.io. They propose paying editors and writers for their work towards publishing Cardano content.

1.  Yes the plan presented is really feasible.
2.  ""Cardanians has been one of the main sources of content about Cardano, with several informative articles.
3.  There are detailed goal plans and the budget allocation was very detailed.""
4.  The proposer is currently in charge of a media outlet. Given their current trajectory and community involvement, they are likely to reach their target with or without community involvement and funding.
5.  ""Work carried out and personalities around Cardanians project gives me confidence in knowing that this has a good standing ground. The experience, knowhow, and determination seem to be present.
6.  I would have appreciated clearing doubts about Cardano Foundation involvement as my understanding is they fund creating articles and doing overlapping activities of sorts to what this proposal suggests.
7.  Is the goal to move away from CF or work as a supplement to existing efforts?""
8.  ""This seems to be a proposal for a centralized (i.e. non-peer review) journal… which would typically be described as a 'trade publication' or magazine, not a journal.
9.  Given that the proposal is already off topic for Fund 2, I would encourage the proposer to re-submit in a later funding round after considering either some partners to mature this into a peer review model (perhaps look at some tech stacks like the Open Journal System?), or cementing that status as a trade publication and justifying why the treasury might consider funding such.""
10.  The current site provides a view into what the proposal and the team behind it can do. The addition of a contributor reward schema can be a tricky thing, and it would be very good to know if the team has any experience in managing such an environment/community for content acquisition.
11.  Breakdown of project timeline and costs is clearly explained and realistic.
12.  Reader engagement metrics and audience profiling would be useful for impact assessment.
13.  No, it not address the challenge.
14.  ""It wasn't clear how the proposal for informative / educational articles will bring new developers / entrepreneurs. It would be important to have access to metrics for counting the view of articles / likes or any tangible data so that the community can follow the impact of the project on the goal established in fund2.
15.  Sufficient and satisfactory information on planning and budget allocation has been provided to assess the feasibility of the project.""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  Insufficient notes provided on how this proposal aims to address the current challenge.
2.  ""Given the loose association with the mission statement that doesn't tie down to the proposal specifics on how it meets this particular challenge - I am unsure how effective it would end up being.
3.  Not that I don't have faith in it - just unable to determine it because initial scope of the project is too broad for the dFund2 theme.""
4.  Very off topic for Fund 2.
5.  It is very hard to determine the feasibility of a business model without knowing how the team's talents are aligned with the goals as stated. There is no measurement metric provided which can be used to determine how effectively it addresses the challenge.

04/Nov/20 7:22 PM,323939,1804,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  tools / bridges / all drive adoption , sound plan .
2.  It's a well thought combination of an incentive for others to use the ₳Pay API and also a pet friendly app which could attack friction.
3.  The proposal provides (new) developers with a ₳Pay API - open source toolkit to integrate ADA payments on websites. It is very well described what you get with the toolkit and what to use it for in a website. The possibilities of cases to use it for looks unlimited.
4.  Another surprise project for me! This is a real gem and exactly the type of project Cardano needs to create more viral awareness and real world application. I actually think this proposal should be a bit more ambitious to actually be an explicit objective to become a business whose goal is to take over pet registration infrastructure. Ideally this should be an open source project so that it results in a distributed, but universal pet registration system built on Cardano. I think the merchandise and services associated with this solution would be a fantastic business model. This is actually a shark tank worthy proposal. Good job!
5.  A Cardano application that solves a real need and an open-source Cold Fusion tool kit would encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
6.  ""This proposal is seemingly a very well focused effort to encourage both developers to build on Cardano and to foster business development linked to Cardano. It's proposed timeframe of launching within 3 months is spot on for the Fund 2 challenge.
7.  ""
8.  ""The proposal makes the claim: """"Nothing inspires developers more than successful projects and the development tools needed to build them, especially on new platforms."""" This claim may be correct.
9.  However, nowhere do we see any targets for how many devs will be attracted as a result, or how these will be verified and reported. If no targets, and more importantly no measurement capabilities are identified, how will success be measured?""
10.  The proposer claims that a successful launch of any dApp will motivate developers around the industry to come and build on the platform. The proposer aims to do just that by building Pet Registry dApp on Cardano.
11.  Excellent idea and proposal in itself. Although it does not address the challenge set out in Fund2 directly, I appreciate how it may be easily adapted and utilized by others to build their Dapps.
12.  ""I appreciate finally a project that realises its limitation yet is able to establish a good relationship with the proposal theme at least.
13.  """"Nothing inspires developers more than successful projects and the development tools needed to build them, especially on new platforms. It's the first wave of successful applications and useful tools that will encourage most developers to build on Cardano.""""
14.  I would have also loved to see how they play to ensure this story gets out. What are the plans to make this popular so that people actually learn about it?""
15.  ""The open source API for CFML is squarely in line with Fund 2's goals.
16.  Would have scored 5/5 if the scope was tightened to just the APIs.""
17.  ""Proposal is well structured. There are two parts in this project : Ada Pay and Pet registry dapp.
18.  Ada pay is properly addressing the challenge providing a valuable website Ada payment solution to entrepreneurs and devs.
19.  Pet registry, as a dapp, is less focused on attracting developers and entrepreneurs and more focused on attracting final users. However it will still contribute if successful to add value to the network by onboarding large amount of pet owners. Additionally, it also show to mainstream a refreshing and original use case of Cardano and blockchain technology""
20.  Like the fact some market research has been conducted to highlight likely engagement. Good understanding of the opportunity and future funding is covered without continual investment from CF. Once set up self funded and scalable by funding, well thought through
21.  very well laid out proposal
22.  16 years of dev experience and stake pool operator: that's a good match to ensure success.
23.  ""It is very strong that the proposal also includes the Pet Registry dApp, which is a working and successful implementation with use of ₳Pay API toolkit.
24.  Next to this the Pet Registry dApp is very well chosen as surveys show there is wide demand for this kind of App. This can not only bring.a lot of developers to Cardano but also new users. Furthermore clear break down of development planning and budget.Strong plan related to financing the yearly maintenance costs. The reason I didn't give it a 5 stars is because I miss how the developers and users are going to be attracted to start using the API or dApp.""

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  The concept is fantastic. There needs to be clearer plan for getting this project out there and in use. It has some viral and practical aspects as a concept, but it needs an explicit ramp up or engagement model.
2.  The proposer has over 16 years of relevant development experience. They are a stake pool operator with their own website that hosts a dashboard for stake pool metrics. The proposal has a detailed budget with a maintenance plan.
3.  The plan is well fleshed out with an excellent presentation of deliverables and a budget that is well planned and linked to all the key components that are being proposed. The experience of the developer with more than 15 years of of commercial experience developing web apps coupled with stake pool management experience is an added factor that makes this project seem as a very very good candidate for funding. I especially like the fact that its model could be used and replicated for other purposes.
4.  The team seems quite capable. The choice of CFML may be a limiter, as it is a lesser known and utilized technology (Usage Stats and Market share, reports .3% usage in 2020)
5.  The proposer has extensive experience within the industry, considering the low cost to fund the project it is likely it will get support.
6.  Well thought out proposal with research conducted and solutions to match in proposed app. Reasonable budget, clear cost breakdown, experience defined and a workable plan. Very likely the proposal will be implemented successfully.
7.  Unable to determine identity of the proposal beyond stake pool operator. A LinkedIn profile or similar would have gone a long way determining if the experience and everything is relevant.
8.  Timing and costs all look reasonable for an experienced developer. I would have liked to see a bit more depth to the team to handle contingencies.
9.  first point, proposal shows a certain maturity and experience of the proposer. As a software company owner, i can see that all the estimates are reasonable and properly sized. Proposer looks like an experienced developer with good track record. Some examples a past projects would help to understand if his professional experience perfectly matches the scope of this project. But from the proposal content, production plan, budget proposed, i feel quite confident he can deliver what he is proposing.
10.  Particularly like the timeline proposed, only 3 months to operational, would be good for delegators (with pets) to get some kind of relationship with the pool, that way growth of pool could be very rapid
11.  Direction is right and adoption of cardano made easy thru pets
12.  Could add a marketing strategy
13.  It's a well prepared plan. I liked the delegation pool idea to cover maintenance, also the potential users research done in reddit.
14.  The proposal has clear deliverables. I would expect some key milestones regarding when what is available. Finally how are we going to make this a success when the ₳Pay API toolkit and the Pet Registry dApp are available? How do we make sure developers will use the API and users will start register their Pets? So what will the marketing look like to get this all used?

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  While needing a bit more focus on execution details, this project seems like it will sell itself. I want a QR collar ASAP!!! Make it happen!
2.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, credentials, and success metrics.
3.  ""This proposal stands out for its clarity and it does provide a clear understandable description of the problem and how it should be addressed, as well as sufficient material to assess its feasibility
4.  and impact.
5.  ""
6.  The proposal provides plenty of information to assess feasibility. It is difficult to say that it provides enough information about how it addresses the challenge. There are no metrics of success. The deliverables shown do not address how many devs and businesses will be attracted, or how this might be measured.
7.  Extensive information provided on budget and timeline breakdown with realistic deadlines.
8.  A successful completion of this App with it's open source code should pave the way and encourage other to build on Cardano. Definition of success has been defined in deliverables with a realistic strategy to self sustainability. Would have been nice to see a simple roadmap and milestones even if your project duration is anticipated to take 3 months.
9.  ""I appreciate the thought put behind the numbers. It is clear and concise.
10.  What I am missing is what sort of benchmarks are self imposed on the project. Is it just the fact that the pet registry issue will be resolved - is this sole definition of success?""
11.  It would have been nice to see a linkedin profile or a portfolio of prior work from the proposer, but taken at face value this proposal is sufficiently sized that the Treasury could risk an initial funding release and see how the first 3 week milestone (API work) went.
12.  Production plan is clear. Budget is reasonable and a bit under the actual market prices. Level of information provided is good and answering all my initial question. good works and good luck :)
13.  Overall very impressed with presentation, thoroughness and ref material to highlight it's feasibility and it's success is fully auditable. Re it's impact, think that is the only unknown, i would like to think that all current ADA holders with pets would connect and they can then each provide a possible outlet to growing the name of Cardano through their friends/relatives etc. As a dog owner myself, dog owners tend to be very chatty :-)

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Proposal did not address the challenge
2.  ""The proposal's basic idea is to establish a competitor to Cardano Foundation based on a similar principle.
3.  The focus should be to avoid excess administration and bureaucracy, but this idea is focused on adding another expensive layer of elected officials.
4.  In my personal opinion, it goes against the principle of decentralisation and all can be achieved thought Ideascale and Voltaire without this additional body.
5.  In addition, it does not address the goals of Fund2 in any way.""
6.  Seems to be a proposal to build another Project Catalyst. The proposal does not address the challenge of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
7.  Too indirect and too broad not focused on making devs and entrepreneurs want to join.
8.  There is no description stating how this proposal will help solve the challenge of fund2.
9.  The proposer's statement does not align with the current challenge.
10.  ""I don't understand connection between the proposal and dFund2 theme:
11.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""
12.  Very off topic for Fund 2.
13.  The is no plan for encouraging developers and businesses to build on Cardano within the next 6 months
14.  I cant find detailed documentation for this proposal.
15.  ""The proposer has experience in leading community groups, but no experience in setting up a working system for this Council.
16.  In addition, the Council would have many members who need to be somehow voted in and incentivized.
17.  The requested amount is substantial and covers the incentives for the Council members with no clear duties, KPI's or any quantifiable metrics to access the impact of the idea.""
18.  The proposer claims to have relevant experience leading and contributing to community groups.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  No precise plan nor the experience of the proposer was presented in a manner allowing a proper assessment.
2.  ""The proposer describes having 10 years of experience contributing to community groups, but this definition is very vague. I think it would be important to better describe his professional experiences so that we can evaluate.
3.  There is no clarity as to what this project will bring to Cardano and nothing that indicate the relevance of this to the objective established in fund2. The proposer committed to send documentation explaining how the council would be structured and its operations if there was support from the community, but I think that before the community offers support we need to know whats the purpose for having a council financed by the treasury and what benefits this would bring to the community. Due to the lack of clarity in the objective and the lack of details in the definition of the budget, it is difficult to understand the need for 500,000 ADAs that were requested.""
4.  The proposer claims to have relevant experience in the subject matter and could gain community support given the right conditions.
5.  Cannot establish proposal's owner experience/credibility per lack of reviewable sources.
6.  There is no plan here and the proposer has no provided any links to background material or portfolios of work.
7.  Some experience, but plan is hard to achieve.
8.  No detailed documentation.
9.  ""There is no detailed information to properly evaluate the added value of the idea or it's feasibility.
10.  In addition, there is no direct connection to the Fund2 challenge, even confirmed by the proposer in the comments section.""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  Past experience on managing community groups would be useful for feasibility assessment. Evidence of Cardano community contributions including Project Catalyst would be beneficial. Discussing how this council would be different from the Cardano Foundation and Project Catalyst would be useful for impact assessment.
2.  not enough data provided
3.  The goals were not clearly described. There are no milestones to assess the project's performance by the community. The budget was not detailed and this makes it difficult to further assess it.
4.  The proposal does not provide sufficient information on how it aims to address the current challenge.
5.  Project doesn't go in necessary detail to determine its effort seriously to be considered under funding. Hence, unable to figure out whether it is feasible nor efficient. Especially, given the amount of money involved.
6.  Off topic and unplanned.
7.  The is no plan for encouraging developers and businesses to build on Cardano within the next 6 months

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  I would really love to see the ADA logo as marketing strategie in a football tournament. But I don't think this is the right moment for this proposal. We want to attract developers in our ecosystem and after that we want to make our self recognisable. I don't say this is a bad idea(I would be very proud to see the logo.) But I think Fund 4 or 5 will be a better timing because of the larger ADA treasury and for now not matching the Challenge.
2.  ""Completely miss how this idea would result to developer adoption.
3.  Suggestion for a possible dApp: a sports betting app using ADA. ""
4.  Proposal don't addresses the challenge
5.  A sports channel does not address the challenge of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
6.  This is just an idea that lacks substantive background in terms of budget and KPIs. No real plan developed
7.  This project doesn't describe how it is related to the challenge of fund2.
8.  No actionable proposal just an interesting idea and an extremely indirect way of addressing the Fund2 challenge.
9.  The proposal fails to connect dots between the challenge and actual purpose.
10.  Off topic for Fund 2.
11.  No actual plan for onboarding developers
12.  Its not a proposal, should be withdraw. No correlation to the challenge. As proposer said ""This is purely an idea for somebody to run with"".
13.  A sponsorship as no direct effect on an developers decision, also no funds are requested.
14.  I'am missing a bit of information about what the cost will be. What does a regular match cost, are there any differences in country's, what excellently are you sponsoring? I give it 3 stars because I think its not that hard to sponsor. But I need more budget info.
15.  The entrepreneur has no prior experience, and given the community member's feedback has not been incorporated yet in the proposal, I highly doubt it will be successfully implemented. At least it seems not with current effort put into this idea.
16.  This proposal don't have execution content.

3.  The proposer reported that he had no experience and no value was set for the project budget, so there is no point in continuing the assessment.
4.  No budget, information on experience or work examples provided.
5.  Cannot establish credibility based on the information provided.
6.  No plan and no experience.
7.  No experience. This is purely an idea for somebody to run with

04/Nov/20 7:19 PM,323781,1768,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Yes rising awareness in LATAM community is very important and needed, will help to bring attention of more entrepreneurs and developers to our ecosystem but the proposal has a focus on broad audience.
2.  User is focusing on marketing to devs in the LATAM community which to my knowledge is an untapped community more so than others. I think a podcast similar to TCE or some others we have in English will be able to help expand our reach for a relatively low cost into other demographics of developers such as LATAM.
3.  ""The proposal is based on marketing and promotion but in the Spanish language.
4.  Although it does not directly address the Fund2 goals, promoting Cardano in another great language might tap into future businesses and potential developers on the LATAM market.
5.  The potential of LATAM and growth of interest in crypto has been nicely presented.""
6.  This proposal effectively addresses the targeted audience of the podcast and effectively addresses the potential to reach a very large number of app developers and businesses in spanish speaking countries.
7.  A Spanish podcast would increase public awareness. A more targeted approach would deliver higher ROI in addressing the challenge in encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
8.  ""What guarantees that a new channel about Cardano can attract developers and entrepreneurs?
9.  We already have the position of content creator in the Cardano ambassador program, I don't see the urgency in financing more content creators with fund2, as it is not clear how general purpose content will have a relevant impact on fund2's objective. I think that the next funds will be more appropriate to finance content creators.""
10.  The proposal aims to target LATAM community to advertise blockchain and Cardano to a non-English speaking audience. This has the potential to attract some developers who currently are left out.
11.  ""I am giving this a 4 star only because I recognise the need of content in any other language than English. If this was such. I'd give it 3 star only.
12.  Primarily, because it doesn't make specific remarks that would tie the content creation over the next 6 months to reflect:
13.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
14.  I can picture what that could be - however, it should be spelled out in the proposal for people to understand.""
15.  I am 'on the fence' whether a generic podcast will bring more devs or entrepreneurs into the Cardano space… typically scoring them 2/5. But happy to give 3/5 to a podcast that is targeting a specific linguistic group to expand the reach of the platorm.
16.  It will address many additional people, but it's questionable how many developers or businesses will get onboarded

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  It is focused on bringing more developers via awareness of the Cardano project in LATAM. This is a good approach, and valuable for the region.
2.  ""It is generally accepted that podcasts attract developers and businesses to the project.
3.  What seems missing are expected metrics. Reporting how many listeners and watchers is a good metric, but it is a bit general to address the challenge in a measurable way.""
4.  Very nicely laid out , good presentation
5.  I feel that proposal lack information about the strategic approach, if we want to attract more business and developer we should focus in a communications specific for this audience, not to a broad public.
6.  Proposer has over 20 yrs of experience in the film industry and published content of prior works. High confidence that this proposal will get implemented successfully.
7.  ""The proposer has the demonstrated experience, equipment, already running project and has presented samples.
8.  Focusing the narrative to Cardano with some good guests should be easily implemented.""
9.  The experience of the team indicates they can implement this proposal successfully. The proposal is lacking in detail and would benefit from elaboration on subject matter to be covered in the first few months. The proposal does not include a breakdown of use of funds so it is assumed funds are used exclusively for the team/marketing and not for production equipment.
10.  The proposers have relevant film experience.
11.  ""The proposal doesn't mention who will be the hosts of the podcast, so it is not possible to evaluate their experience for the function.
12.  The idea of the proposal is to have one podcast per week, totaling 24 podcasts. There is no breakdown of the budget.""
13.  The proposer currently runs a YouTube channel and is likely to achieve its goal of reaching LATAM community with or without Cardano community's involvment or funding.
14.  ""I am unable to verify or determine following experience credentials:
15.  """"A video production company with over 20 years of experience in the film industry working with major telecom franchises such as Millicom.""""
16.  From other materials provided - it seems that this is a legitimate group of proposal owners. However, some firm attempt at identifying persons behind - such as linked in or reference would have been wonderful.""
17.  ""Body of prior work seems substantial enough to justify the rates and funding requested is low for the quality.
18.  Given other podcast proposals have routinely gone ahead and generated some test episodes for community to gauge the quality, this is the major improvement that could have lifted the score here.""
19.  Plan seems easy to implement and there is good experience in the team
20.  The team has experience in media editing and design. I think they have the knowledge to see the project to its completion.
21.  The team is highly qualified and have proven track records in Video content creation. To give a 5 star rating here, I would need to see some expected results in addressing the challenge. How many devs and businesses currently watch their content. What is the makeup of the demographics that watch Spanish language podcasts about crypto-currencies?
22.  Yes, but i fee that the proposal need to be a bit more tuned to match the challenge.
23.  Proposer has established the structure of his podcasts, interviews with prominent figures to discuss commercial benefits and bring awareness. Feasibility is high and risk of failure is low. It will be easy to prove the effectiveness through number of viewers of the podcast.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  ""The proposal has valid background data, samples of work, proven experience and track record.
2.  However, it does not directly address the Fund2 challenge, but focus on the Spanish language is a major positive upside.
3.  The budget is a lump sum with no cost breakdown, but for an established business it can be considered as a normal B2G proposal.
4.  Measurable metrics are presented and can be used to evaluate the project, especially since 24 episodes are planned which will give enough data.""
5.  The proposal is light on plan details but effectively conveys the experience of the team, the target audience and size of the market and the maturity/acceptance of cryptocurrencies to date. The proposal would be stronger with a breakdown of the use of funds and an outline of the initial episodes.
6.  Past releases of podcasts would be useful for feasibility assessment. Audience engagement metrics and profiling would be useful for impact assessment.
7.  ""The definition of success is very subjective. The success of this project depends on the reach of the audience of the channels and the proposers have not set goals on the reach of these channels.
8.  The proposers are committed to providing monthly channel metrics (Youtube, Spotify, Itunes, etc …) as number of downloads, listeners, and subscribers and this allows the community to monitor the reach of the channels' audience.
9.  I did some calculations and each episode of this podcast will cost around 6,000 ADAs for the treasury (which I consider a high value compared to similar proposals). I think it is important to give more details about the budget allocation.""
10.  The proposal is aiming to target a broad range of potential users and does not specify how they will achieve attracting developers to Cardano platform.
11.  ""I am missing specifics on the following:
12.  """"The most important key performance indicators (KPIS) that we will use for our project will consist of the number of downloads, listeners, and subscribers we get every month trying to grow as organically as possible and being transparent with the community uploading a monthly review during the 6 months that we are active.""""
13.  Thus, proposal recognises that these are the most important KPIs but doesn't make an effort in figuring out what the numerical values would be defining success. It would have been helpful to understand how to benchmark this proposal effectively.""
14.  Some test episodes would have significantly lifted this proposal and/or tightening the content scope on Fund 2 targets.
15.  No clear focus on getting businesses and developers onboarded
16.  There is a lack of specific geographical data. LATAM has 33 countries, and sure most speak Spanish, but there are nations like Belize or Suriname that have English as their official language. Finally, the biggest economy in the region, Brazil, speaks Portuguese. So, to equate LATAM with Spanish is not correct.
17.  Feasibility of this proposal seems high. How it addresses the challenge is not clearly defined, so it is difficult to assess how effectively it addresses it. It seems that any podcast of good quality would address it, but with no metrics, we can not measure.

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  The entrepreneur has withdrawn his proposal. It is not a bad idea for a dApp itself, but I miss how it could increase adoption from developers to build dApps. A suggestion to the entrepreneur: I would emphasise on how papers can be linked to each other based on the keywords. Technically how blockchain can make a researcher's life easy to identify the appropriate papers based on search results and citations of papers.
2.  WITHDRAWN
3.  Funding Cardano development of publishing papers on a side chain is one way of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
4.  The proposer didn't describe how this proposal will relate to the challenge of fund2.
5.  ""Proposer has withdrawn from the challenge.
6.  Declared on 09/Oct/20 6:22 PM.""
7.  ""I fancy the idea but it is entirely out of scope of the current challenge as per below:
8.  """"Scientific discourse is broken. Most publications are wrong. Publishing companies are obsolete intermediaries and most people are left out.""""
9.  vs.
10.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""
11.  Not much attention to onboarding new developers on Cardano
12.  the proposal is not targeted at attracting new developers or other people to cardano it seems. at least it doesnt say how this would be accomplished with the finished product. also its timeframe is way more than 6 months
13.  Off topic for Fund 2.
14.  Development resources are not yet engaged which could possibly create implementation issues.
15.  WITHDRAWN
16.  Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully
17.  The proposer has withdrawn the proposal in a comment on Ideascale.
18.  ""The proposer reported having experience in Chemistry and the proposal is to build a side chain. This project would depend on hiring third parties to develop the technical part.
19.  There is no detail on how the proposer will carry out this project. The budget requires further details and a description of how it will be allocated and the reasons for this allocation.""
20.  ""Proposer has withdrawn from the challenge.
21.  Declared on 09/Oct/20 6:22 PM.""
22.  ""Project would have a better merit if the first goal:
23.  1\. Finding a team of 2 developers in the fist month of the project
24.  Were to be already completed. Unable to judge if this seems an appropriate level of experience needed to carry out the proposal itself. Especially, since it is missing some key players. ""
25.  No experience in product development, IT-development or blockchain development.
26.  i cant see how experience in chemistry research will enable someone to build something as complicated as a cardano sidechain. In addition i'm not sure what is meant by sidechain in this context and how the product will work. there doesnt seem to be a team and there's no more information what will be done exactly and how. it's impossible to assesss.
27.  There are some hints that this might be possible but the timing and cost estimates seem very naïve. Substantial planning information is missing.
28.  ""Not having an estimation of cost from the development resources, it is a challenge for me to accept the cost asked to finish the project.
29.  Also not having yet engaged to developers, results to the proposal missing the technical roadmap. ""
30.  WITHDRAWN

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  The proposal includes a roadmap, milestones, and credentials. The problem and solution described do not address the challenge.
2.  ""No objective goals were described, nor were milestones dates defined. There is no clear indication of how this project will meet its goals as its goals are not objective and well described.
3.  I believe that this project needs more explanation, more documentation and clarity so that it can be better evaluated.""
4.  ""Proposer has withdrawn from the challenge.
5.  Declared on 09/Oct/20 6:22 PM.""
6.  Provided information gives no depth of information required to effectively judge the project. I have no idea how the amount of the ada requested is warranted for the project beyond very basics.
7.  It is lacking on the implementation side, but otherwise OK
8.  crucial information is missing in this proposal. no technical insights, very condensed roadmap with no real milestones, just finding a team and then suddenly the first part is done. no word about the purpose of fund 2 and no outlook on success, marketing or anything else really
9.  Off topic for Fund 2 and lacks sufficient planning.

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  A good idea for a dApp, but needs more refinement and details to shape it in an idea which will help bring more developers onboard to build more dApps. The ""trade app"" which is mentioned in the proposal is possibly a good path. Please try some more brainstorming, it could lead into a good app.
2.  Incomplete proposal
3.  A football player trading platform does not address the challenge of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
4.  This proposal does not describe satisfactorily how it will solve the fund2 challenge.
5.  Proposal does not address Fund2 challenge. Author has stated ""Just an idea for somebody to run with"".
6.  This proposal clearly ins't a serious one as stated by the proposer himself. Probably should have withdrawn.
7.  ""This proposal does not make appropriate effort addressing the challenge scope:

12.  Advertising towards sports fans is not that relevant to get developers onboarded.
13.  i dont think it does because its in no way related to attracting new developers or users. its just a random idea with no real plan on how to achieve it
14.  Off topic for Fund 2.
15.  Quoting the proposal: ""None. Just an idea for somebody to run with."" Very unlikely that the idea can be successfully implemented.
16.  Incomplete proposal
17.  The proposer states that they have no relevant experience, and that the proposal is ""just an idea"" for other implementers.
18.  The proposer reported that he has no experience and that this is just an idea to be taken by the community. No budget has been defined, so it makes no sense to evaluate this proposal further.
19.  No details of prior experience or work provided. No budget or plan provided.
20.  The proposer states this is just an idea for somebody to run with. Not a serious proposal.
21.  Since this proposal doesn't have appropriate level of depth - we don't even know who is asking for the funds. It is difficult to think how to allocate funds lacking all that info.
22.  Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully
23.  As stated: ""None. Just an idea for somebody to run with.""
24.  since is not an actual proposal and there is no plan at all. it is 100% certain that nothing will be accomplished.
25.  This is just an idea. Needs significantly more information to turn into a proposal for funding.
26.  I would like to see a collaboration with a developer to possibly add some details on the steps to bring it to market. But given the details of implementation are missing I believe it does not leave any choice but 1 star.
27.  Incomplete proposal

3.  Insufficient information to assess feasibility or impact of idea. Does not address Fund2 challenge.
4.  To be fair it says clearly in the proposal that it is not to be implemented by the proposer hence all necessary info for us to consider is not available.
5.  This proposal doesn't have a price amount filled in? Is that a bug or on purpose?
6.  Extremely lacking in details.

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  I doubt a song will attract developers to build on Cardano.
    
2.  I like the idea of creating a song for Cardano, but completely miss the explanation how it can help developers adoption. I doubt if a song can be a sufficient reason to attract developers to build apps on Cardano. Overall, I see a gap to fit it in the target of Fund2 Challenge goals.
    
3.  This is a really nice proposal but don't address the challenge.
    
4.  I dont see almost any alignment with the fund challange.
    
5.  It seems that this proposal will do not add much value to our goal of encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build dapps and business on top of Cardano.
    
6.  The proposal's aim is to market Cardano to a wide audience via the musical industry, it does not align wth the current Fund2 Challenge.
    
7.  The idea that a song can be funded is simple, new, and incredibly powerful. Should there be public awareness that even a song can be funded, developers and entrepreneurs would be encouraged to participate in subsequent Project Catalyst iterations.
    
8.  Although this proposal does not address the challenge directly I can see a possibility of a new developer being attracted to the ecosystem by the Cardano hymn albeit the chance is slim, perhaps there will be space for proposal of this sort in future chalenges
    
9.  A novel proposal which builds awareness to Cardano but does not address the challenge of Fund2 directly. No measurable metrics to assess ROI.
    
10.  could just as easily cause division. our community is too large for a single song to appease everyone. Does not address gaining of consensus
    
11.  No information was given on how music would have the potential to attract developers and entrepreneurs to Cardano.
    
12.  I am not convinced that song would enable a cross-over to the dFund2 theme:
    
13.  ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"" and related to the measurable metrics for the fund ROI:
    
14.  \* How many developers were encouraged to build on Cardano?
    
15.  \* How many entrepreneurs were encouraged to build on Cardano?
    
16.  I wish more attempt was made trying to address this issue in the proposal itself.
    

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  A song about a blockchain project is not a solid argument that will get developers involved.
    
2.  Extremely off topic for Fund 2.
    
3.  The proposer did already good progress on the project and is documenting it regularly, so I believe they can really make it happen.
    
4.  Given the samples, it is very likely that it will be implemented successfully.
    
5.  Yes the team is capable of implementing
    
6.  There is some sort of timeline but it very general. No budged plan, only the final price and its quite high.
    
7.  I dont like the samples too.
    
8.  There is probably chance for the project to be done, but there is lack of seriousness of the proposal.
    
9.  The proposer claims to have relevant experience and has ongoing works in music, however, this is not aimed to attract developers.
    
10.  The proposer has relevant music composition experience. They propose having the community contribute clips for the music video.
    
11.  The idea is feasible by the proposer and also does not address current challenge
    
12.  I don't think it would be possible for the entire community to get behind one song, some would accept it begrudgingly or not at all
    
13.  The proposer has a YouTube video channel with 2 subscribers, 5 published videos and 7 views on all of his videos. He did not mention previous work or study experiences that would allow a detailed assessment. There is no detail on how this project can impact fund2, nor a description of how the budget of 100,000 ADAs will be used.
    
14.  Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.
    
15.  Seams reasonable experience, would have loved greater establishment of who the person really is - maybe linked in profile, etc. 12 follower account on Twitch doesn't give me confidence I need to understand who will be accountable for these funds.
    
16.  Example of prior work provided but no evidence of effectiveness or measure of success. Budget appears a bit high.
    
17.  It seems like the proposer has the experience needed to follow through on the project
    
18.  Copious information in the proposal to reinforce that this would likely succeed... at delivering a song... about Cardano.
    
19.  There is no information on what impact is expected from this proposal.
    
20.  The plan is clear, the idea shows signs of a good refinement.
    
21.  This proposal don't addresses the challenge.
    
22.  There is no enough informations of the proposal to assess its feasibility. Its really early stage, with no budget plan, no real roadmap.
    
23.  There is no clear description of the problem it want to solve, no definition of success.
    
24.  This proposal falls short in explaining how it will utilize music in order to attract developers to move over to the Cardano platform. The plan itself is broken into time slots but does not seem to mention budget requests.
    
25.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, and credentials. The proposal would benefit from more past works that include community contributions, and traction within the Cardano community.
    
26.  I believe it is virtually impossible to measure the impact of the idea so given the amount the proposer is asking for I can't see how the community would audit this..
    
27.  A song could be written and chosen and it still wouldn't solve the problem. While you may be able to excite the limbic system, most wouldn't understand why without some education
    
28.  No goals were set. There was no breakdown of budget allocation.
    
29.  It would be very difficult to understand measurable metrics on how this song would create those measurable outcomes for the Cardano. I can appreciate a targeted effort such to be included with the marketing efforts of Cardano as a whole - but I am at a loss figuring out how this helps us in the current challenge scope of this particular round.
    
30.  As the proposal does not address the challenge directly, there is insufficient information to assess it's impact.
    
31.  The feasibility might be there, but it is lacking in how effectively it's addressing the challenge
    
32.  Off topic for Fund 2.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  This is directly in the spirit of cardano (banking the unbanned) as well as directly addressing the challenge. So the idea is good - yet the potential effectiveness is not clear. This type of project needs long term support for it to be able to sustain itself
2.  This proposal put a developer directly where is most needed, with a reasonable time frame to show results and bring more engagement in the region.
3.  ""Although the idea is noble and, the proposal does not have a clear direction and is also not clear on its overall aims and objectives:

1\. It proposes to train up to 10 people on functional programming, but does not lay out what these people will do with their newly acquired skills, only that it will have something to do with Cardano and to solve """"some of the problems in Malawi"""".

2\. It proposes to train secondary school children in programming, but it is not clear if this training will involve Cardano.

3\. It proposes to develop a solution to exchange between MWK and Ada, but it is not described how this solution will look like. Will it be an online exchange, or a more manual approach like physical contacts between exchange partners?

I could see objective 1 and 2 fitting together, if the trained people in 1. aim to specifically train the school children in Cardano, but probably that is a too advanced topic, when the school children do not have any programming skills in the beginning. Objective 3 appears to be completely unrelated to 1 and 2, and thus does not fit in the project whatsoever.

So the only potential impact I see is that there might be 10 more people in Malawi with some functional programming skills that may have an interest in Cardano. ""

1.  Teaching functional programming in Malawi does not address the challenge of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months. The timeline, budget, and experimental nature indicate that the proposal would be a better fit for future Project Catalyst iterations.
2.  This project would definitely bring new developers but it seems difficult to achieve in just 6 months.
3.  Teaching functional programming does indeed address FUND2 challenge. The idea of training new developers with Cardano specific orientation (Plutus, Marlow, Haskell..) might be a little hopeful.
4.  ""The proposal directly addresses the challenge of fund2, due to its educational nature in training developers for Cardano, but the budget requirements for investing in Malawi seem prohibitive. We would have to allocate 25% of the fund2 to finance the education of only 10 students for 6 months and this doesn't seem to me an efficient way to allocate the resources of fund2.
5.  There are many people willing to learn and pay for it, I think that exempting students from costs is already a sufficient incentive, offering about 12% of fund2 for scholarships is not an efficient way to significantly increase the number of developers. Remote education is a more efficient and cheaper way to reach a larger number of students, in addition we are still living in times of covid-19 and this can make it impossible or difficult to attend classes.
6.  I think this proposal has an important social appeal, but the focus of this proposal seems to be more in the social sphere than in the objective of fund2. I think the proposal would be more appropriate for future funds.""
7.  ""I was torn on this proposal. It has lot in common ethically with some similar proposals in Fund 2, but has a much poorer plan with only one person behind it. For that reason I had to score it down based on 'effectiveness'.
8.  I would encourage the proposed to consider a later funding round with some partners and a more detailed plan.""
9.  For this proposal to be funded, I would prefer to see relationships already established with organisations in Malawi that are ready to collaborate and provide supporting resources to help make this successful. Clearly a lot of thought has gone into this proposal, but I think I would need to see more of a foundation and clear path to implementation before committing funds to this project. This type of effort could have long term value as an incubator or small school which could have a lasting impact for years to come. However, I don't see any articulation of sustaining this in the long term.
10.  This proposal require a good teaching skills, would be nice to have a bit more details about the other participants and If possible a video class and a meeting with the Team members talking about the project.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  ""The proposer has some experience with living in Malawi and many years of experience working with Malawians, but it is not clear what the relation looked like, or if this experience was gained in a professional, job-related environment, or more privately, like friends, spouse, etc. Outlining this in the proposal seems to have been important to understand the context and evaluate the relevant experience.
2.  I believe the proposer has sufficient experience in functional programming, but it is not clear if he also has experience in teaching functional programming to others. The approach outlined rather seems to be theoretical and from text books than from own experience in teaching.
3.  I'm not sure if the proposed team members fit to reach the objectives of the project. Two of them seem to have experience in community development, but this is not an objective of the project. Although I see fit for a financial officer in the suggested company and also for managing the project, the person also does not seem to be fitting for achieving the proposed objectives.
4.  Most of the first two months of the project will be spent settling in Malawi and setting up a business. I believe this is sensible, but it might also be too optimistic. My own experience with working in Africa is that bureaucracy is often painfully slow, so it may take even longer to settle.
5.  I honestly don't see a way how this project can be implemented in only 6 months. It will likely take already this amount of time to settle in Malawi and setting up the company, and then start a little bit of capacity building for the employees. But I don't think they will be advanced enough to train others (the school children) in the six months time frame.
6.  The project plan itself is unstructured and aims to address multiple problems in one project, which poses the high risk of losing sight of the overall aim. If this project is not selected, I suggest to rethink the approach and select only one of the three ideas if there will be plans to re-submit a revised proposal again.
7.  ""
8.  The proposer has written Elm toy projects as a hobbyist programmer.
9.  It is quite a bold endeavor with many aspects not well defined. A lot could go wrong.
10.  I can not imagine that it is highly likely to successfully implement the plan as described as some hopeful thinking was expressed. Although entertaining success of the implementation does not seem like an impossibility.
11.  ""The proposer has many years of experience as a programmer, but he has little material related to functional language for evaluation in his GitHub repository. He did not mention related professional experiences.
12.  ""
13.  ""For the amount of ADA requested, I feel some sort of accountability to a person that we can verify is useful. More references of previous work for each person involved or LinkedIn would put me to ease. At the moment, I am unable to determine if all of mentioned is enough experience to pull this through.
14.  The roles aren't clearly thought through because vague language is used. Also, unsure about team dynamics - how do we know this is team that will stick together? ""
15.  The plan presented is very vague. It is not so much a case of it 'couldn't work'… but more that it isn't a plan to make it 'highly likely' it will work.
16.  The proposal is very well defined. So I am able to assess feasibility. The goals are also clear. I have concerns about execution and sustainability, but those areas are made clear because the proposal is so clealy defined. Great job! With a little more work I think this proposal has a lot of potential! I have been to Malawi and would love to see this happen.
17.  Yes the proposal is very clear about the intent and how will addresses the challenge, but i feel that is lacking in a continuity plan. After implementing part of inciative, how will sustain itself?
18.  This is a complex project, which would have deserved much more depth in the proposal. Although I can see the vision of the proposer of building a Cardano developer community in Malawi through training of staff and school children, I don't regard this project as feasible and sufficiently thought through.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  Teaching experience and community work would be useful for feasibility assessment.
2.  The proposal is quite detailed but it is more a long term risky project not well suited for fund2.
3.  The plan as it is described is feasible. The proposer suggests to start a for profit business in Malawi and asks Cardano treasury for full 500000 ADA required in exchange for including Cardano specific courses in the curriculum. Let us weigh the ask (20% of the current's challenges funds) again the benefit we expect from a successful implementation..
4.  ""There is a detailed planning, goals and deadlines.
5.  The Budget was very detailed, but the requested amount was 25% of the fund2 and there is no strong indication that this proposal will bring a significant return in relation to the requested budget.""
6.  ""I am worried by motivation of funding.
7.  """"I cannot legally start a business in Malawi without at least $50,000 worth of funds to invest in the """"Warm Heart of Africa""""""""
8.  I generally like the idea - but I cannot shake off the feeling of having this as a funding request to pursuit personal goal of sorts.
9.  I would have loved getting an alternate understanding of motives. ""
10.  Some information supplied, but not sufficient. It would be good to see some partners with educational or tech backgrounds… even if they are not on the ground in Malawi.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Social Networks are a great idea to drive the adoption of Cardano
2.  Yes this proposal addresses the criteria to this challenge, but its incomplete and with errors in the funding amount. The proponent put 340k as a funding request and it will crash the voting app.
3.  This proposal fails to deliver a clear description of the idea, plan to deliver. I completely miss the refinement based on the comments provided by the community members. And most importantly it does not address how such a marketplace would attract developers to build apps. Irrespective of my feedback so far, I think a marketplace that allows you trade with ADA could possibly bring some adoption for Cardano in general. But why create a new marketplace while you could use an existing one where ADA payment method is added?
4.  Funding the development of a social commerce platform may not be the best way to encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
5.  unrelated to current challenge
6.  This proposal has an interesting premise, but the proposer doesn't give details of how it will have a relevant impact on the challenge established in fund2. Furthermore, it wasn't clear the need to join a social network with a market that accepts ADA. There is a lack of clarification of the objective.
7.  The proposer offers to create a marketplace for Cardano, which would require developers to build. It does not, however, specify how this will attract developers going forward.
8.  ""Unfortunately, I don't see how the project translates the connection with the dFund2 challenge theme:
9.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""
10.  This proposal fits really good with the challenge of this Fund. A marketplace for chatting and buy/sell has portents.
11.  Off topic for Fund 2.
12.  The is no plan for encouraging developers and businesses to build on Cardano within the next 6 months
13.  Work in progress is nice to see
14.  I was not able to see any evidences that this proposal can be developed, this proposal need more refinement.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Website and SEO knowledge will be most probably not be enough to complete such a complex problem.
2.  The proposer claims to have built many websites. Their public GitHub projects are only crypto faucets. They propose hiring to develop the platform.
3.  no plan presented, idea is quite vague, provided GitHub account shows no activity in the last year and mostly contains forked repositories.
4.  ""The proposer did not mention how much experience he has with website development. There are some previous works with faucets on the proposer's Github, however they are simple works and do not indicate that he has much experience. He mentioned that he could hire someone to assist in the development of the project, but there are no details of what function will be needed or what budget is needed for that.

16.  proposal
17.  no information of that nature was provided. This proposal seems abandoned.
18.  There is no detail on how the project will be developed, nor on goals that the community can follow. A budget of 340,000 ADAs was requested, which corresponds to approximately 1/6 of the fund2, but there is no detailed allocation of this budget. it is important that the community has a good detail on how the money will be spent, not least because the amount requested was above the average of the projects and large in relation to the totality of the fund2.
19.  The proposal lacks sufficient information on how it aims to address the current challenge.
20.  ""No financial benchmarking nor budget breakdown at all is provided.

1.  Yes! This is a multiplier. Exactly the types of projects we need early on

3.  Having an organization on top of similar proposals helps a lot to optimize pricing, not only that, but it allows a more optimized environment in catalyst for software development and entrepreneurs to understand the community's proposals.""
4.  """""" How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
5.  Proposer has acknowledged that both content creation (marketing) and Dapps builders are needed in this fase.
6.  1) Marketing is needed for awareness of project Cardano and adressing opportunities that come foreward with it. Attracting Dapp builders and businesses via media.
7.  2) Reserving enough funds for Dapp builders to make valuable working products, so Cardano can evolve in an much bigger meaningfull and usable system. This would create awareness and attract more coders, Dapp builders, …
8.  In order to both sides can recieve funds, building this Guild is a more time and money efficiënt way to handle the content creator aspect. --> ROI
9.  Timeline: dec 2020 develop standards, vision with other creators (15000 ADA)
10.  jan 2021 bringing the Guild alive, workflow, funding mechanism via voting, community meetings (15000 ADA)""
11.  A content creation guild is proposed as an alternative to having content creation proposals outcompete other less popular but important proposals in Project Catalyst. The project involves codifying standards in 2 months, so as to start managing content creation proposals in Jan 2021. This would reduce the workload required to review and vote for proposals in future Project Catalyst iterations, as well as contribute directly to marketing and encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
12.  ""This is an interesting proposal to filter the large number of proposals for podcasts that are requesting funds in Catalyst. I think there is a great disparity between the proposals for podcasts in relation to ideas, proposals and budget and I see the need to organize this and allow for better evaluation and standardization.
13.  However, as several podcast proposals do not demonstrate to have a relevant impact on fund2 this proposal also doesn't have a significant impact on fund2's proposal, but I recognize that organizing proposals for podcasts can help to better filter proposals in the next funds.""
14.  This proposal would make it a lot easier for the Catalyst process to run effectively, and promote good ideas. It would allow all the Catalyst developers to more easily get their idea heard and voted for.
15.  ""I would need to understand better the semantics of the project of Guild with dFund2 challenge itself.
16.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
17.  I can imagine how that can be determined and leveraged - but project should be making these connection more visibly. ""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Seems redundant with Catalyst, adding an intermediary in an ecosystem supposed to remove them. Moreover, indirectly funding content creation is unlikely to bring new developers/entrepreneurs in the next 6 month as is required by the current fund2 challenge.
2.  ""Off topic for Fund 2. Something in this space would be very interesting though in later funding rounds.
3.  Given how little ADA is being requested it might still be worth the community considering this in Fund 2 though.""
4.  Clear plan of action, clear value proposition, crisp articulation that meets an emerging need in our ecosystem. This is well worth trying to establish because of the high upside if it is successful.
5.  Yes, the first phase is bringing a lot of the podcasts that will not make during this round and debate about how they can kick-start the content creation, the first steps of this proposal are a framework that worth a try in relation to the cost.
6.  ""Relevant experience of proposer:
7.  The proposer has labeled himself as Teacher, Marketing professional, Entrepreneur. A quick review of his proposal shows that he has marketing skills and teaching skills (making an educational quick overview of his proposal via a YouTube video, a presentation and informative spreadsheet). He has 1+ year of experience as a Cardano-Focused YouTuber. Therefore he seems reliable and up to the task.
8.  Remark: be cautious by using abbreviations (for instance: V.E'd means … ?)
9.  Sensible plan and budget:
10.  His presentation raises the issue of ineffective competing for funds via Catalyst between marketing (podcasts, video, …) and Dapp builders. Different timeframes and amount of funding: Content creation has to deliver fast vs Dapp needs some time to develop. Therefore his proposal for a building a Guild with KPI-driven funding from funds coming from the Guild, is a more efficient way (faster, more coordinated approach). It also gives the ability for 'new talent' to have a (small) 'starters' fund.
11.  His budget and timeframe for setting up this Guild is realistic.""
12.  The proposer produces videos for the Why Cardano? YouTube channel and has relevant content creation experience. Traction with other content creators and the community is required for the project to be successful.
13.  ""The proposer has a YouTube channel with more than 60 videos about Cardano, but there are no further details about his professional experience.
14.  There is a very detailed plan, with defined deadlines and a well-defined budget allocation.""
15.  Thorough presentation and plan, along with experience in the area.
16.  The author seems adequately knowledgeable in the area of the proposal itself. This is evident through the presentation of the information as well as depth of thought put into this.
17.  The proposer has some Youtube experience but no information is available about a related experience in a similar project. We don't know if the proposer is alone or if he has a team behind him.
18.  Not sure about 'highly likely', but the requested amount is low and it seems a worthwhile experiment

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  Content is really important, yet infrastructure viable POCs and working solutions that engage and inspire developers, innovators and world changers are much more vital to the ecosystem. If you build it they will come. This provides a viable venue for content creation which created a different arena for funding. That would hopefully allow these treasury funds to focus more on the projects that really will take cardano technology and capability to the moon (maybe even literally )
2.  Yes this proposal is completely feasible and having a better organize content creation, with proper KPI, also having others content creators helping in the process of creation helps a lot.
3.  ""The proposer has made a clear roadmap with timeline and goals.
4.  His presentation and spreadsheets are clear and understandable, as is his description of problem and solution.
5.  The proposer provided enough content to assess the feasibility and impact.""
6.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, and credentials. There are some open questions about how the guild should be funded and managed in the long run.
7.  ""There is a detailed roadmap with well-defined deadlines and milestones.
8.  Sufficient information has been given to assess the feasibility of the project, but it is not evident that the project will have an impact in the short term, but I imagine that the project can facilitate the organization of proposals in the subsequent funds if approved.""
9.  Very detailed presentation and plan.
10.  ""I would have liked to understand better the fund allocation of 30,000 ADA within budget metrics.
11.  The outline of timeline is very clearly articulated and easy to follow. ""
12.  The relation of the project to the challenge is not discussed in the proposal and information about the feasibility itself is lacking.
13.  It seems feasible, just out of alignment with Fund 2.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  ""The proposal is by the developer building a solution on the Cardano platform and using Plutus for smart contracts integration.
2.  It is completely in line with Fund 2 goals.""
3.  Funding the development of a governance dapp may not be the best way to encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
4.  The proposal aims to incentivize contributions to open-source projects. This could attract developers to projects that are well funded and have the resources to pay for ongoing development rather than relying on willing participation.
5.  Supporting open-source projects is a very good idea to bring developers to the Cardano ecosystem. Most of the blockchain projects are developed as open source.
6.  ""I am not entirely sure how to match this proposal statement:
7.  """"Create a graphical DApp to manage open source governance, including consensus and funding""""
8.  with dFund 2 goal:
9.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
10.  More work is required to make that obvious at first sight. Unfortunately, not the case at the moment. ""
11.  Off topic for Fund 2. Given the peripheral relationship with general developer tooling, I've bumped the score to 2/5 since there might be some minor inflow of developers to Cardano… but overall this proposal doesn't address the focus of Fund 2 in a deliberate way.
12.  ""The proposal is backed by an experienced developer, prototype code and presented samples.
13.  The funding would be used to program beta version of the proposal which is open-source and in line with Cardano mission.
14.  The plan has objectives to be accomplished, budget and timeline.""
15.  The proposer has developed a prototype on Ethereum. The budget will only fund the project up to the production of interactive wireframes. As such, funding of the proposal would only deliver on encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano should the business idea be validated and additional development is funded in future Project Catalyst iterations.
16.  The proposer claims to have experience in the field as well as similar project for Ethereum platform.
17.  The project is in the very early development phase and seems there is only one developer behind it.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Would love to learn more about proposal owner. It doesn't help us establish the accountability at the moment.
2.  Clearly the proposer's experience with open source projects has hit some significant problems. Given my own experience is very different, perhaps it suggests some basic research is needed to explore actual problem space before pushing forward with Treasury funded solutions.
3.  ""Information is presented on sufficient experience, working prototype, plan with deliverables and the deadline.
4.  The proposal is built on Cardano, implements Plutus Smart Contracts and addresses the funding of open source projects.
5.  The proposal has enough information to conclude that it addresses the Fund2 challenge and to feasible.
6.  Business idea should be validated first or at a reasonable cost. Business growth and development expansion projections would be useful for impact assessment.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  The proposer states that they will require continued funding going outside of the current Challenge. The proposal lack timeline breakdown.
2.  There are no clear milestones, success metrics or KPIs in the proposal.
3.  ""Proposal makes a grand figure requested and it suggests it covers initial steps only. I am unable to determine what budgetary requirements are for each of these segments. There is no budget break down available - and hence - missing crucial information to understand feasibility.
4.  Following - understanding success metrics is also missing the mark. I like the idea - but it just doesn't have presently what to hold on to. ""

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  For the time being Adapools is a valuable service for the main Cardano feature. However, in time staking will become one of the least interesting things about Cardano. So this seems useful and supporting the current ecosystem and stake pool operators achieve their goals, but would prefer to see features that are more engaging and drive business development
2.  While mobile and web services are useful it's the API part itself that addresses the challenge the best. However, with the proposal being updated twice talking about future funding rounds this makes it difficult to asses. As it stands now ""Goguen"" tools are pushed for future rounds which makes it irrelevant to this challenge.
3.  This proposal addresses given challenge in the sense of the promise of providing developers with existing APis and future Dapps tracking info for wider Cardano community as such it has value.
4.  Funding new features and operational costs would keep ADApools.org independent. New API endpoints would streamline the developer experience.
5.  Extending and making ADApools outputs available to more developers will increase the development of dApps. Next to this the transparency of the already existing Adapools.org website shows everything what is going on regarding, stakepools, blocks, performance and rewards on the Cardano blockchain. This is also very important information for entrepreneurs if they want to decide to start building new businesses on Cardano. This could be stakepools, but also other service on top of them.
6.  The existence of a continuously improving reliable pool tool like ADApools.org will encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano.
7.  Blockchain explorers are an important part of the structure of a blockchain, as they allow integration with several existing projects on the blockchain, through APIs, so I believe that the improvement in infrastructure and integration between projects on Cardano's blockchain is important to attract and retain developers.
8.  The proposal's first priority is to streamline the ADApools.org with Cardano's roadmap and ensure a decentralized source of information for SOPs and users alike. The secondary function will create an extra data feed for developers in order to better understand the needs of the ecosystem.
9.  ""I appreciate highly the explanation of how the project connects dots between this project and dFund2 guidelines on theme.
10.  It isn't as clear cut as some of the other specific projects though. With regards to fitting to the:
11.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
12.  Not by its fault but by the nature of the project suitability.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  ADApools certainly seems popular and valuable… but is is difficult to justify that relationship with Fund 2 challenges in a more than vague fashion.
2.  Given the work done to date there is no question that this project will be caried out successfully
3.  A team with experience that built one of the most used websites by delegators and stake pool operators besides pooltool.io
4.  already established
5.  There is very little doubt of implementation capability of the proposers as their stakepool tracking already exists and works ;-)
6.  The proposers have developed ADApools.org.
7.  The proof is in the pudding. As ADApools.org is already live and one of the most used tools related to the Cardano blockchain. This team is very capable in extending what they have started as private funded initiative.
8.  Due to past performance and experience of the team, this is a relatively low risk proposal.
9.  ""Adapools is one of the leading explorers in Cardano's blockchain today and has made different tools and improvements available to delegators and SPOs.
10.  Some important aspects about the integration with other projects through APIs were mentioned in the planning.
11.  The requested budget would cover one year of development, which I think is unnecessary because the fund2 proposal defined the target period of 6 months to fulfill the objective. It would make more sense to reduce the budget to meet the time set in Fund2 and to request more funds in the future.""
12.  ADApools.org has become the primary information source for users to navigate through ~1200 SPO. Further development and decentralization is beneficial to the overall ecosystem of staking on Cardano.
13.  ""It is evident that the proposal owner has a track record that speaks for itself.
14.  It would be nice learn more about actual profile to understand 'human' element though. LinkedIn profile or similar for greater transparency.
15.  However, there is a high expectation of completion by the developers of this project. ""
16.  Looking at what adapools have succeeded so far,
17.  The team behind ADApools certainly have demonstrated they have the technical 'chops' to deliver on this.
18.  Well I deeply appreciate the pools and the work that they've done to date, is not clear to me how this satisfies the goals of the challenge. Intent seems to be to stay in step with developments in cardano, but the funds are only for one year with no plans in place or stated for turning this enterprise into sustainable one.
19.  The plan is clear and the timeline is reasonable but the ""API part"" is included into maintenance budget/timeline and it is unclear how fast the output on this can be achieved. That part is the most important one for the devs to start building on top of Cardano.
20.  digital expansion is almost 100% and it strengthens a good tool
21.  Based on the information given it is up to every individual voter to decide weather the amount requested pays for value added to the ecosystem. This is a question everybody needs to answer themselves. The challenge here is being addressed by the proposer and there would be some use to the average developer by it ;-)
22.  API usage metrics would be useful for impact assessment.
23.  Clear description of deliverables, timelines and required budget. Very good idea the proposers have created a clear scope for this fund round and already announced what we can expect for next fund round. It would be nice to add a roadmap with the various phases connected to the various fund rounds. This forces the proposers to create next to the short term planning also a more long term planning and vision: ADApools.org goals for 2021 and 2022.
24.  The addition of new API tailored to expand the use of the available information on the network is very promising in terms of addressing the challenge.
25.  ""The roadmap and established goals were well detailed, which allows for easier monitoring and compliance with goals.
26.  The information described allows verifying the feasibility of the project, but the impact of the proposal on fund2 is something more subjective, as the idea is to create a good structure that allows integration with other projects and this is not something that can be easily quantifie, as the arrival of new developers and entrepreneurs at Cardano would be a secondary impact.""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  The proposal does a satisfactory job of providing timelines and budget breakdown.
2.  ""Missing some KPIs that would help us determine how to benchmark the success of the project.
3.  This can likely be easily rectified - thinking about how many developers would be using the APIs - what's the target.
4.  So that we can measure if the expectations have been managed accordingly.
5.  Otherwise, this is fairly straightforward proposal. ""
6.  Feasible, but not necessarily related to Fund 2.

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  Forward thinking
2.  Such Cardano Swift SDK, can make, developer's life easier and prove to be a tool which can attract more developers.
3.  This proposal is great and have already a demo that already is payed itself, we need a better way to find content about cardano and this helps developers and entrepreneurs to communicate.
4.  The proposal suggests creating a bridge tool for mobile developers in order to ease their transition over to dApp development.
5.  A mobile dapp library may encourage new developers to build on Cardano. It will be made available through the Tesseract framework. The framework has minimal visible traction, based on the GitHub repository, and the official website. It is used by Alacris and Blockchain Cuties. It seems unlikely that such a library would encourage developers to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
6.  This proposal effectively addresses the challenge to encourage development of Dapps on the Cardano network. It does this through enabling the IOS developer community to build IOS Cardano dApps via the proposed SDK. To date over 1.38 million publishers have published apps on the IOS App Store.
7.  ""I appreciate the effort - I would have loved to understand more how these efforts will be popularised more.
8.  I understand what it does for the ecosystem - but how do we get people to actually use it? Once it is al built. I don't wish to fund a road to nowhere that however nice - cars won't use. Thus making that clearer would be great. ""
9.  Adds immense value and ease of getting starting with developing dApps on Cardano. It plays directly into the needs of curious developers, and makes it very easy to get started and try it out.
10.  This proposal squarely addresses the challenge by providing tools for developers to deliver dApps. What is lacking to make this assessment a 5 is any notion of measuring the number of developers actually attracted by the tools provided. This may be technically easy to do, but it is not part of the proposal to assist in assessment of that metric.
11.  This seems like a good step for the community and would contribute useful tools for developers to build on top of. Score could have been improved if the submission recommendations had been followed and output's IP status had been made clearer. I shouldn't have to dig around on the tesseract site to work out if this is going to result in open source code or (as I suspect) would just enhance a commercial framework in the IOS ecosystem.
12.  Great project, which will help dApp developers to build using Cardano and bring developers to Cardano.
13.  Very accurate proposal to challenge topic. Can add much value to encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
14.  The experience of entrepreneur would be a great advantage in the given plan.
15.  Yes the POC is working
16.  The proposer claims to have experience building dApps and developing tools for blockchain platforms. The proposal does not clearly state whether this is a solo or group effort.
17.  The proposer has developed the Tesseract dapp platform. It is used by Alacris and Blockchain Cuties.

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  The proposal team have demonstrated experience enabling IOS dApps for Ethereum. The proposal includes a breakdown of key milestones and deliverables but would be stronger with the inclusion of effort estimates tied to budget. It is not currently evident that the funds requested can cover off the costs for development/testing/documenting the SDK. It is reasonable to assume the team can be successful based on their experience with Ethereum, Emurgo, etc. A more detailed breakdown of the use of funds would strengthen the proposal as would a breakdown of resource allocation and effort tied to each deliverable. Are we trying to put 20 pounds of laundry in a 10 pound sack? Would additional funds enable faster development times improving time to market?
2.  ""Given the association with existing entities such as EMURGO - it is likely that these know how to delivery.
3.  However, I would have appreciated to learn more about the person making the proposal, such as a LinkedIn profile, or so.
4.  Potentially, I would rephrase this section on your website as it reads not very well:
5.  """"We've prioritized iOS support to bring dApps as the first-class citizens to iPhone. Desktop and Android is coming soon. Have fun """"
6.  Language suggests that iOS users are first class citizens - unsure how to translate that into human language. Maybe I am just misunderstanding this.
7.  ""
8.  Given the teams track record and their competent advisors, it is highly likely that they will be succesful.
9.  There is no doubt that this team has the talent to accomplish what they set out to do. The strength of previous accomplishments listed is very good.
10.  ""The key here is 'highly likely'… which I cannot agree with.
11.  The timeline aspect of the plan actually looks sound, but the proposal does not actually address how they will resource that plan or what the funds will be spent on.
12.  There are also unverified claims regarding financial relationships with Emurgo that it would have been good to see more detail on. As it stands we can only follow breadcrumbs to the Tesseract website and (if the provenance is real) find some linkedin profiles of the two proposers which simply suggests they have worked together at the same companies for several years and have a tendency towards IOS solutions.
13.  In future funding rounds it is highly recommended that you flesh out proposals with more detail and consider some backlinks to verify when asserting claims to credible sources.""
14.  The proposal has sensible plan and fair budget, but budget breakdown is not defined. By researching, I assess that proposer are experienced and capable to delivering the project.
15.  Relevant experience of proposers. Team already commited. Protocol is already launched on iOS. No described budget plan.
16.  Very organized
17.  I would like to see a bit more detailed approach in the plan of implementation, but definitely address the challenge.

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  This proposal is very feasible and addresses the challenge. Love to see what will be addressed for the next funds.
2.  Well outlined plan with a clear timeline and budget breakdowns. Low cost and high potential to attract developers from the mobile industry.
3.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, deliverables, and credentials. Existing applications that would use the library when implemented would help assess whether the project was implemented successfully. Tesseract platform metrics would be useful for impact assessment.
4.  By reflection of previous success on Ethereum the proposal provides sufficient evidence of feasibility and the shear number of developers/publishers contributing to the IOS platform address the potential developer community.
5.  Unfortunately, how good of an idea this is - it provide for no clarity on budgetary front at all. I have no understanding how these funds are going to be used to advance the efforts of this project.
6.  A budget is lacking, but the rest of the information is highly detailed.
7.  The plan is well thought out, and the team has the talents required to assess feasibility. It addresses the challenge by providing a Cardano SDK for tools that developers use regularly. It would be good to see some anticipated count of developers metrics.
8.  Unfortunately the team has provided no information about themselves or the type of resources they intend to allocate to the problem.
9.  Provided sufficient material to assess feasibility and impact.
10.  Roadmap presented. Provided enough materials to assess feasibility of the project.

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  Well laid out informative
2.  I think the idea overall could likely bring in many new businesses, developers, and users to the Cardano community if implemented correctly.
3.  Reading the proposal I am failing to understand how using blockchain would be a good fit. ERP systems is a very tough market, with ""locked"" customer base, which seems a bit impossible to survive in open source projects.
4.  Yes, as a opensource project that involve cardano it tends to attract more developer and entrepreneurs because it is a ERP
5.  Funding Cardano development for an ERP platform is one way of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
6.  This proposal presents a high level vision of an open source ERP platform. From the problem statement it is not clear how this proposal will encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses within the Cardano ecosystem. It suggests a bottom up approach to the problem starting with investigation/selection of a technology stack. It does not clearly identify market need or research that points to an opportunity for exploitation of gaps in the current ERP landscape. It does not present a compelling strategy for the use of Cardano.
7.  """"""With this funding, I want to put together a potential team. A plan on how to build the platform. And finally, find at least 1 partner who is willing to integrate with the platform to solve their problem.""""

9.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"""" and related to the measurable metrics for the fund ROI:""""
10.  \* How many developers were encouraged to build on Cardano?
11.  \* How many entrepreneurs were encouraged to build on Cardano?
12.  However, I appreciate the idea behind it - but it needs to be more articulate.
13.  ""
14.  This proposal addresses the challenge by suggesting that developers will be needed to implement the ERP platform. It does not directly address the number of devs it hopes to attract. this metric is needed to assess how well it succeeds over time.
15.  This is off topic for Fund 2. I can see some huge potential in this space, but also lots of fierce competition from large sector players, so not something you want to tackle without a solid plan and some partners.
16.  bridges drive adoption
17.  The proposal in the current stage is intentionally vague as it seems to use fund to focus on coming up with a team and plan for a course of action. As such, it is difficult to assess likelihood of success since it appears that only a project manager has been identified (the proposer).
18.  I am missing the specific experience of the entrepreneur with existing ERP systems. ERP tools is a very broad concept, (supply chain, finance, storage, salesforce etc.) and usually takes years for an individual to get a good grasp of all those.
19.  The only thing i'm missing here is what problem the product will address, i would feel more comfortable if the first step of this proposal had a benchmark to understand what are the problems this entrepreneurs will solve with this ERP
20.  The proposer does not have relevant marketing experience. They propose contracting consulting work to choose a tech stack. The proposal states that partners are ready to integrate on the platform, but it appears to be a goal instead. The proposer has submitted another proposal to develop a open-source multiplayer game engine.

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  There is no ERP background or experience identified by the proposer. There is no target market identified such as small to medium business enterprises. There is no particular functionality stated as a starting point for the ERP system. For example, Workday started out as a cloud based HCM system by experienced PeopleSoft executives. Maximo is focused on manufacturing. The initial strategy is to identify a technology platform but there is little mention how that will work with Cardano. There is no plan for delivering a POC or MVP. It is unclear how the funds will be used.
2.  It is challenging to establish credibility of the person requesting funds. A linked in profile and additional information on relevant experience would have been very helpful. I cannot allocate funds to projects for 'unknown' persons.
3.  ""The plan as presented needs work in order to assess how likely it is to be implemented successfully. Currently, it resembles a research project to determine the tech stacks that could be utilized.
4.  The Proposal is seeking several key team members. If they were already on board many of the missing elements for proper assessment may be filled in.""
5.  This looks like an idea, backed by some passion, but not really a plan.
6.  Proposal identifies potential interest interest in the platform, but does not clearly state any specific deliverables that need to be accomplished to be able to showcase a platform demo to said interested parties. Additionally, little mention was made on dependencies of the platform (smart contracts not yet released. Wouldn't businesses want a permissioned platform, i.e. Gerolamo dependency?)
7.  ERP has very tough competition and starting up an initiative without a clear plan of the tools and the demand is not a good idea. Building such a platform is harder than it seems, and I don't get the confidence it is accounted for.
8.  i think we lack a clear understandable description of problem.
9.  Past work on ERP platforms would be useful for feasibilty assessment. Business growth and development expansion projections would be useful for impact assessment.

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  The information provided is very high level and does not provide enough compelling information to convince the reader that an investment in this project will be beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem. A definitive problem statement identifying market gap and opportunity for exploitation would improve the proposal as would a team member with domain experience.
2.  ""Many great KPI questions. But seems too much focus on just that - raising questions. But we need to understand what these questions are benchmarked against. What are the values, what is the actual future point on wishes to be.
3.  As it is, there is very little information provided that would able an appropriate level of depth when trying to benchmark the project. ""
4.  ""The proposal is lacking the committed team composition that is required to accomplish it. It would be better to acquire the team commitment and approach another Catalyst Funding round with a fully planned out proposal. That would allow for a full assessment of the feasibility.
5.  Providing targets of how many devs would be attracted to build ERPs utilizing the framework of this Proposal would also be a good way to ensure that the Challenge is being addressed.""
6.  Off topic and under planned.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  ""The proposal is based on marketing and promotion but for the Japanese market in Japanese. The goal is to raise Japanese participation in Governance of Cardano, similar to Ambassador role.
2.  As stated in Charles AMA, that market was the first to invest in Cardano with ICO being held in Japan, but to this day participation by Japanese remains low.
3.  Although the proposal does not directly address the Fund2 goals, raising the visibility in Japan is worth the symbolic cost requested by the proposer.""
4.  While I understand your concern, separatism creates cliques. I would like to see live translators in place for each townhall. Regardless, I agree it requires action.
5.  Growing the Project Catalyst Japanese community is proposed as a solution to their heavy underrepresentation in Project Catalyst. Diversity of opinion is important and better informed voters would lead to better voting outcomes.
6.  Popularizing Cardano among different languages, cultures, and communities is aligned with the fund goal.
7.  ""I highly appreciate the value for ADA coming out of this proposal.
8.  I just don't have clear understanding of how exactly these meet ups match with the dFund primary theme:
9.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  This proposal brings some measures to reduce this barrier and improve participation in the protocol's governance decisions.
2.  Even if this proposal is not approved in fund2, I think it is extremely important that the problem presented by the proposer is resolved as soon as possible, by later funds, ambassadors of the Japanese community, IOG and Cardano Foundation.""
3.  This is very off topic for Fund 2… but also a problematic issue and this proposal puts forwards a very cheap contribution to address it.
4.  ""The proposer demonstrated experience and provided samples of the previous work.
5.  The plan is sound with the measurable KPI's, schedule and money-return promise.
6.  Although the current subscribers on his Youtube channel are around 1000, this might be a large number for such a niche target audience (Cardano+Japanese).
7.  Reaching KPI's, however, might not be entirely the merit of this proposal and vice versa.
8.  ""
9.  I agree something must be done and he seems to have a plan of action.
10.  The proposer has generated value for the Cardano community with their YouTube videos and many contributions on Ideascale. The plan and budget are sensible for the proposed project.
11.  The plan is quite detailed, unfortunately, there is not much written about the proposer.
12.  ""I have every reason to believe that this is a community member that is capable of delivering on the promise of the project itself.
13.  Would be even better if professional identity was brought forward, not just nick name. :)""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  ""The proposer is a Cardano ambassador with more than 150 videos about Cardano published on his YouTube channel, I believe that the proposer has enough experience and is one of the few people who can perform this task due to his position in the Japanese community.
2.  Detailed planning has been described to improve the engagement and integration of the Japanese Cardano community. The requested budget is relatively low for the established plan.""
3.  The plan could be more fleshed out… but given the low amount of money requested it is probable ok to take a risk here.
4.  ""The proposal provided sufficient information to estimate the feasibility.
5.  KPI's were presented, goals and methods to achieve it.
6.  The proposal has schedule and milestones to monitor progress.
7.  The Fund2 goals are not directly addressed, but raising awareness in the Japanese market is needed to create interest in the Cardano platform.""
8.  All community members must have a voice. he's speaking up.
9.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, credentials, and success metrics.
10.  The roadmap and KPIs are very detailed
11.  ""Very clear KPIs and the amount requested vs. effort put into this project is rather appropriate and would have no issues rolling funds this way.
12.  Especially, given the language opportunity that Japanese represents.""
13.  ""There is a detailed roadmap, with deadlines and objective milestones.
14.  Sufficient information has been given to justify the feasibility of the proposal.
15.  It is unclear how the proposal will impact fund2's goal, but the problem presented undermines Catalyst's governance by creating little support from the Japanese community and I believe it needs to be solved as soon as possible.""
16.  Proposers would like to do something to better serve a currently under served community in Cardano. It seems a worthwhile risk to take on a basic plan and see what sort of returns we get.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  ""The proposal is based on using nice visuals and storytelling to influence businesses and developers to build on Cardano. The main punchline is energy efficiency and conservation of the chain, basically being eco-friendly PoS.
2.  However, business around the world might not find eco-friendly as first or sufficient motivation to switch to Cardano. It could be argued that low fees compared to Etherium and speed of execution are more important.
3.  Eco-friendly is very important in developed nations but less so in developing, where things such as electricity access or food security are more important. If looking at blockchain, then speed, low fees and ID systems might be more important.
4.  To conclude, there will be an appeal for some businesses and governments to build on Cardano due to eco-friendly approach but not a worldwide impact.
5.  Re-focusing on other more universal aspects might be more beneficial.""
6.  A short animation of this sort could be easily shared, as well as localized across many languages. The funding request is modest for the impact that it could have.
7.  Animation can make information more digestible and Ether GAS prices are going to drive migration
8.  A short animation targeted at developers and entrepreneurs could encourage them to build on Cardano.
9.  I think this proposal is great, but the strategic tone is lacking to face this challenge, they could provide at least the script to be able to evaluate
10.  ""Energy efficiency is an important factor in the ecological issue, since mining requires a lot of energy consumption, which has a negative impact according to the type of energy source and hardware equipment, which are harmful to the environment and become obsolete in a short time and end up generating excess waste.
11.  However, the proposal didn't demonstrate that concern for the environment/ energy efficiency is a priority for developers and entrepreneurs when choosing a blockchain, this is an unsubstantiated assumption, it would be ideal if we had some research to support this argument and understand the relevance of the subject.""
12.  It's a great way of giving a brief introduction to what Cardano is about
13.  ""It is not entirely clear to me how the proposal plans to fulfil dFund 2 objectives:
14.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""
15.  Off topic for Fund 2.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  ""The team has presented the team experience, past projects and samples.
2.  Since the proposal is based on the same work principle as done before there is sufficient info to conclude that the proposal has a high likelihood of being implemented.""
3.  ""The examples provided as well as the websites for the proposing team show very well the quality of work that is done.
4.  During the refinement phase comments were efficiently answered and incorporated. ""
5.  Animation looks solid
6.  It is unclear what the exact ""story"" of the animation would be although we can all guess. Creative freedom must be given. Proposer seems perfectly capable of creating said animation..
7.  The proposer has shared their animation portfolio.
8.  Yes the team has a strong capability and skill to deliver
9.  ""The proposer has experience with video animations and left some works as a reference in the proposal.
10.  ""
11.  Vast experience in creating informational videos.
12.  ""I would have appreciated some streamlining between the Big J, the proposed links and personalities.
13.  It is difficult to navigate who are the people behind the project effectively.
14.  There is a link to a single individual but text keeps referring to """"we"""". It would be nice to know if there are more team members, who they are, what their roles are, etc.""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  Body of background work suggests this could be credibly achieved by this team.
2.  ""The proposal lacks information on the metrics or key performance indicators that would help in measuring the impact.
3.  Since the nature of the project is promotion, it will be difficult to judge how many businesses have actually switched to Cardano solely due to this proposal.
4.  The asked amount has no division of costs or timeframe for delivery.
5.  To conclude, there is not enough info to assess the actual impact of the proposal on Fund 2 specific goals.""
6.  ""The PDF storyboard provided for the animation, including the costing and breakdown of the work effort are well presented, and significantly increase understanding of the proposer's capabilities.
7.  This is a well defined project by a team that has done a lot of animations across many verticals.""
8.  While this approach may be niche, it is targeting a niche demographic
9.  Success of the idea hangs on the amount of traction the animation would gain. We all would love to see Cardano specific animation having millions of reviews. It is up to the voters to weigh the amount requested with the consequence expected..
10.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, deliverables, and credentials.
11.  How the story will impact developers and entrepreneurs specifically? What will be the KPI? Maybe this proposal in incomplete and need a marketing strategy with ads campaign in order to provide feedback.
12.  I think it is important to describe the duration of the animation, how many people will develop it and how the budget will be used so that the proposal can be better evaluated.
13.  Some explanations given, but lacks a direct target for distribution and projection for impact.
14.  ""Funding request isn't very transparent. There is one grand figure but it doesn't tell how the funds are going to spend exactly.
15.  It feels more like a contract like relationship that commissions the work to be done. I don't think this fund is the best place for such requests at the moment.
16.  Nor does it make attempt to invest time of how we will measure its success - what metrics, etc. ""
17.  This is off topic for Fund 2. I would recommend consideration in future funding rounds though.

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  A lottery can be seen as gambling and I don't think that's the image Cardano is looking for to attract developers.
2.  I believe there are much more easy ways of ""marketing"" Cardano to developers than creating a lottery. Also I am missing how the lottery itself will make easier for developers to work on their ideas on dApps. Overall, it is a good idea and project to have, but I feel it might not be suitable for this stage of Fund2.
3.  This proposal is a bit far from the challenge, its not something for the next 6 months.
4.  A lottery would create public awareness and onboard new Cardano users, of which developers and entrepreneurs would be a subset. A more targeted approach would deliver higher ROI in addressing the challenge in encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
5.  proposal doesn't solve the problem until after its solved. If someone has a wallet, they have an ID
6.  ""There is no clear indication that this proposal meets the objective set out in fund2. It is not clear how a lottery could attract developers and entrepreneurs to Cardano in the next 6 months.
7.  The proposer made assumptions that a lottery would have the potential to attract visibility for Cardano, but the community needs tangible data to measure return capacity.""
8.  ""Given the fund's challenge:
9.  """"""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"""" and related to the measurable """"
10.  I fail to see cross-over based on the below:
11.  """"The first six months are focused on recruiting 50 salespeople to get 2 million locals to participate. Next to recruiting the 50 participants, we also need marketing material (including a website) and develop the Wallet-lottery.""""
12.  Purely based on this criteria, the project seems to be heavily off the scope. I like the general sentiment - but it just doesn't fit for THIS particular round. Would love to see it come back in the future rounds instead where scope may be more fitting.""
13.  It is possible that this business would attract developers and businesses to Cardano. The proposal makes no estimates of how many. If we can not measure those attracted, how will we know if the proposal has effectively addressed the challenge.
14.  This is extremely off topic for Fund 2.

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  The team seems skilled and experienced to do the job, also there is a detailed plan present.
2.  Good experience in profit and non-for-profit organisation, but what's the experience in online lotteries?
3.  The wallet implementation and the back end sound a bit underestimated, the first step before asking for fund should be a first stage with a developer to scope and assess the amount of work will require to the sales force be able to sell and process all this wallets. This proposal need a better clarification at this point.
4.  The proposers are a team of 4 with relevant marketing, recruiting, and developer experience. They propose hiring 50 marketers over the first 3 months, who will each onboard 40k users over the next 3 months. The initial 10m ada investment to fund the free lottery tickets would mean that investors would break even after a year should the projected 180k weekly participants contribute an average of 106.8 ada each given a 1% return. These projections seem overly optimistic.
5.  needs revision
6.  ""There is a lot of information about the team's experience. Attached information about the 4 proposers' Linkedin. The team's experience covers areas such as programming (Haskell / Plutus), marketing and entrepreneurship.
7.  There is detailed planning of goals and timeline. There is a detailed budget allocation plan.""
8.  ""Team seems to be experienced enough, including their LinkedIn profiles - appreciate knowing who will be actually held accountable. Is everyone dropping their immediate employment requirements and will be focusing on project itself?
9.  Also, I would have loved to understand what makes this team stick and work together well. Each seem to be doing a separate work ""
10.  The team seems very well rounded. The proposal is to hire sales teams in 3rd world countries to sell Lottery Wallets and garner wagers. No information is provided about the team having worked in these other countries, and having had experience setting up Lotteries. There are many complexities to such a project which are not clearly identified or addressed.
11.  ""Significant unaddressed risks and hurdles in the plan as it stands, plus some internally contradictory logic in the proposal itself… e.g. how does one get a 'financial ID' if you are handed 5 ADA that isn't really yours because it didn't go into an Cardano wallet, it went into a smart contract that is a proxy for you inside this walled garden.
12.  And if you actually win something, you still have significant external hurdles associated with fiat off-ramps and KYC in third world countries before anyone could realise real-world value from the ADA they have been 'given'.""
13.  There is no information about the expected outcomes and metrics to measure success.
14.  I cant find information that point me to a effectively way to address this challenge
15.  There is a high level roadmap of the proposal, which is good, but I miss the technical details and plan which make the project feasible in implementation and launch.
16.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, credentials, and success metrics. Projection methodology would be useful for feasibility and impact assessment.
17.  The proposed solution needs to solve the proposed problem.
18.  ""According to the roadmap, the App would launch in the seventh month of development. If the app will only be ready after the deadline established in fund2 (6 months) there is nothing to indicate the impact of attracting new developers and entrepreneurs to Cardano.
19.  The definition of success is not clear, as the proposal details a lot about the distribution of resources in the lottery model, but it doesn't describe how this could attract developers and entrepreneurs to Cardano.""

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  ""It has a good idea behind it all - but purely based on the question above - it just doesn't seem to be address the challenge effectively. This seems more directly towards consumer end.
2.  I don't understand how this will be an efficient use of dFund2 resources to incite development activity on Cardano. ""
3.  The proposal lacks the information needed to assess the feasibility of all that must be accomplished. No targets are provided with respect to how many developers and businesses will be attracted to Cardano if the proposal is successful.
4.  Mostly addressed in the 'plan' comments. There is little credible information in this proposal that instils confidence the problem space is even properly understood by the proposers.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  The app can be a great means of adoption in general. The fact that all the useful information around Cardano is consolidated in an app, it can prove valuable tool for developers who are following Cardano and ""inspire"" them to contribute. I would suggest to further look for the options to add the ability to track an individual's staking rewards and pool information.
2.  This is an all Cardano information hub as proposed (paid subscription as I understand) and as such It can have great value to the Cardano enthusiasts. In regards to attracting new developers to the platform via supporting the implementation of this app I am sceptical as there is no evidence of such intent.
3.  A mobile app that would target developers and entrepreneurs by collating developer resources and success stories. It seems unlikely that another portal would encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
4.  This is a great proposal, be able to connect our community in a more curated and have a place to aggregate information that tends to float around twitter, blog posts and forum. The app can be very helpful to attract entrepreneurs and developers.
5.  The proposal aims to attract developers by creating a tool that will ease access to relevant information with regards to the Cardano ecosystem.
6.  ""I very much like the idea of the app.
7.  Unfortunately, it is not entirely clear how will this specific app case push more developers to create on Cardano.
8.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
9.  I think there is way to spin this but would require additional input. But I shouldn't be left guessing as proposal needs to have this spelled out.
10.  Off topic for Fund 2. There is nothing here that specifically targets devs and/or entrepreneurs
11.  Directly pointed at developers and businesses
12.  The entrepreneur has quite some experience and the MVP presented show the project is in good track.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  The app is evidently in working condition having capable developers on board, no doubt about that.
2.  The proposer has engaged a developer and released an MVP website. The budget will fund mobile app development and other community requested features.
3.  Yes, but part of road map could be more specific, like community feedback features, also a better breakdown in costs and a marketing budget.
4.  The proposer claims to have relevant experience working within the financial industry and to have already started work on their project in the prototype phase.
5.  ""There is a need to expand on this:
6.  """"20+ years in the Financial Industry running teams and developing applications for Top Tier Banks.""""
7.  I am not able to verify these - a linked in profile would have been sufficient. Or any similar professional reference guide. It is important to validate claims when presenting strangers with information.
8.  However, I have seen the activities on social - so there seems to be good determination to make it work. ""
9.  The team certainly appears capable of delivering a mobile application
10.  Somewhat lacking plan, but otherwise simple and some experience
11.  The entrepreneur could have provided a better break up on the planning of each feature.
12.  This proposal is a quality proposal with a capable team. But does it address our challenge? In my opinion it does not.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  Audience engagement metrics and profiling would be useful for impact assessment.
2.  Generally entrepreneurs like to have a friendly environment to get information, if its organized and well curated this can help to bring people more close to what is happening in our ecosystem .
3.  The proposal lacks sufficient information on budget and timeline breakdown as submitted on Ideascale.com website.
4.  ""As much as I love the idea and effort, I could not find any specifics on budget. I have no idea if this is the right amount or what the funds are going to be used for exactly.
5.  This also means - we have no means of benchmarking this effort effectively at the moment.
6.  It would take an additional hour of input and it could be golden. I can't in good faith make that call at the moment.
7.  Project is missing an actual workable business plan. Which is very surprising at this stage somewhat.""

1.  ""I don't really think this matches the challenge Because we don't attract a lot of developers by creating this application.
2.  However its a good idea in a later Fund! ""
3.  Funding the development of a dapp for certificates of authenticity for art is one way of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
4.  I like the idea but it's not attracting any devs and it's not relevant to this challenge.
5.  The proposal does not address the challenge directly or indirectly. It can be deducted from the use case that, if properly implemented, it will increase the popularity of Cardano.
6.  The proposal aims at artists, not developers.
7.  If necessary for the art industry, I hope cardano can help. But this proposal is underdeveloped to be financed, and I also believe that it does not meet what is sought at this stage.
8.  proposal doesn't provide means to authenticate and integrate existing chain-of-custody nor provide methodology for on-chain registration and authentication
9.  This proposal don't addresses the challenge of bringing developers in the next 6 months, it also lacks more details of implementation .
10.  An interesting App proposal which provides a useful solution to the art industry. It does not however address the challenge of Fund2.
11.  This proposal addresses a real problem (fraud) and that has already been addressed by Charles Hoskinson in some videos. Some projects are being developed in different blockchains to certify the provenance of unique items. But it wasn't clear how this proposal will contribute to the challenge of fund2.
12.  ""Unfortunately, I fail to see the connection of the current proposal with:
13.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""
14.  This is a wonderful use case for a dApp. It is not evident how the proposal intends to attract more developers and business to build on Cardano. There is no mention of the challenge.

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  This looks like a very vague idea for NFTs that fails to address Fund 2.
2.  No implementation plan, nor plan for onboarding of new developers
3.  It wont have much impact on the challenge topic. Its not even proposal its concept for someone to pick.
4.  It's looks like more of an idea than that it is a compleet proposal. You have all the technical key ingredients. But I am missing a compleet plan. With who are you gonna work to make this possible, where does you're budget go to, etc.
5.  The proposer did not cite relevant experience. The proposal does not include implementers nor a plan.
6.  There's no plan whatsoever, nothing about the experience of the person proposing. Cannot be audited…
7.  Proposer does not state his experience in the proposal, but does claim 20 years experience in the comments. Plan is also not stated in the proposal and when asked in the comments, proposer simply states that the plan for the first 5 months is creating the registry of art without too much details. No information on blockchain development experience or plans to hire staff to develop.
8.  The proposer has detailed their experience, neither plan how to make their proposal happen.
9.  The idea is good, but the experience in the field cannot be verified in the proposal. With the proper analysis and development, it would be useful, but as presented, it seems far from being done in the time necessary for fund2.
10.  no proposed methodology for implementation
11.  I was not able to find a detailed plain and roadmap with breakdown in costs.
12.  No details of prior experience or work provided. Budget request appears a bit high with no cost breakdown provided. Insufficient information to ascertain if proposal will be implemented successfully.
13.  ""The proposer didn't describe any experience in the proposal, when reading the comments on Ideascale I noticed that he reported having 20 years of experience in the Art market, but he didn't provide further details.
14.  It is not described in the proposal whether the proposer will need more people to participate in the project.
15.  There is no detail as to how the project will develop or the budget allocation.""

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  Cannot establish relevant experience nor verify it under information provided.
2.  ""The proposal provides no information about the team, other than the proposer being an entrepreneur. Building a dApp will require more talent than is identified. No roadmap or timeline is provided by which measurements of progress or success may be made.
3.  Building a business is hard work, and it requires a team of talented folks to fill all of the many roles. We are not provided with enough information to assess any aspect of how it will be implemented.""
4.  No real plan present
5.  No implementation plan, timeline nor experience added.
6.  No relevant experience of proposer. Not even explained who would make this app. No plan, no budget, just final price asked.
7.  What I said, it's more like an idea than a fully written proposal.
8.  The proposal does not include credentials, and success metrics. Past work on dapps would be useful for feasibility assessment. Business growth and development expansion projections would be useful for impact assessment.
9.  There's no budget breakdown, there is no timeline, no deliverables or work packages. It's just an idea for somebody else to make. The total ADA asked is based on nothing and the project should be rejected due to lack of transparency on how the funds will be spent.
10.  There are no detailed plans in the proposal or comments. More concerning matter is that there is no cost breakdown for the required 650 000 ADA and no feedback on that from the proposer when asked in the comments.
11.  The description is not sufficient to take this proposal seriously.
12.  There is too little information to make a better decision.
13.  without an actionable plan, the proposal cannot succeed
14.  No
15.  Insufficient information to assess feasibility or impact of proposal. No roadmap or milestones provided.
16.  ""Sufficient information wasn't provided to assess the feasibility and impact of the project on fund2.
17.  A solid roadmap wasn't provided, only ideas of what the project might look like.
18.  The proposer didn't explain how the image recognition system would work, which is a critical problem and the entire viability of the project depends on a reliable artificial intelligence system that can assess the origin of a photo.""
19.  For the amount requested - there is absolutely no appropriate level of depth in detail available. It needs actual budget, timeline, benchmarks, the whole 9 yards.
20.  The Proposal lacks resources and citations about the business it intends to be in. Also there is no information provided about how it addresses the challenge. The proposals efficacy can not be measured without clear plans and projected targets/milestones.
21.  This is just an expressed idea.
22.  No implementation plan, timeline or budget added.
23.  Insufficient amount of informations. Lack of roadmap. No even good description on how to solve the problem.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Seems to be a hodgepodge of filler data with no clear execution towards integration
2.  Impressive concept. Very professionally focused on the scope of Fund 2. By creating a toolbox and documentation for promoting CARDANO's unique capabilities for Smart Market Applications (multiple-purpose auction algorithms). This way, a large number of already existing experts on the market will be addressed. A real multiplication-effect can be reached. Producing open-source results is emphasizing and supporting this multiplication goal.
3.  A toolkit for building smart markets which can be used by developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano. The toolkit includes a wide range of deliverables from educational content to prototype software.
4.  The proposed project has the potential to effectively pave the way for devs and entrepreneurs to exploit the key learnings and deliverables from this project and apply them to future entrepreneurial projects on Cardano. If successful, this project will provide guidance for other projects on successful approaches, methods, tools and standards for further enhancement and best practice development.
5.  Too ambitious for fund2, relies on network features that have not been released yet. More a long term research project suitable for a different fund.
6.  This is how you do marketing, explaining and writing a good proposal. There are a few little points but other that its really looking good.
7.  ""Lots of great ideas within the proposal.
8.  However, I am missing clear cut answer in one/two sentences that would answer clearly:
9.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
10.  Now, I can picture in my mind what that may be - but that's not reader's 'job' per se. Would be nice to have that spelled out in the project. There is a lot that fits the narrative - so just adjusting this:
11.  """"The intent of this proposal is to research, design, and prototype a decentralised auction protocol and associated Oracle Pool design. It leverages the work already done by Emurgo Research to enrich and strengthen the economic logic of Stake Pool Operators.""""
12.  …to better reflect the challenge how this will exactly inspire developers onto the platform. ""
13.  Yes, the amount of valuable information information for developers that are on boarding the ecosystem is very good. Also its opensource
14.  ""This project is very ambitious and promises to be an important primitive block for Cardano's blockchain. Smart markets open up a wide range of possibilities and projects that can be created and integrated on Cardano. Integration with the oracle pool model is important to encourage further development of both projects. NFTs alone already bring an immense potential of possibilities in several different niches and it is a billion dollar industry that can generate a large flow of money through Cardano's blockchain.
15.  So I believe that the proposal has an important impact on the fund2 proposal.""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Both the toolkit and the practical implementation examples from the team will appeal to incoming developers. I would also hope that some of the documentation will help entrepreneurs have more confidence in the tech stack to build businesses on top of.
2.  It speaks to a desired outcome without exact methodology
3.  A highly skilled team is presented and already showing commitment and activities (e.g. a very professional video made to explain the rather complex scope of this project). Risks and associated risk-mitigation-actions are outlined. The team builds upon pre-work done by Emurgo and IOG and has framed a challenging but realistic set of goals for fund 2.
4.  The potential value of the smart market is incredible. I worry though that this something which is incredibly complex and has a high risk of confusion in scope and ambition. If I were an angel investor for this project I would actually be expecting the costs and effort to be much higher than what was requested. This is a highly technical project that is tackling some very hard problems. The smart auction protocols require some pretty hard core theory and engineering. For this to be successful it seems a missing part of this solution is either a proven open source smart market protocols OR members of the team that have proven track record for delivering these types of solutions in other domains (like ebay or other autobidding applications). Given the short time horizon you need to have some plug and play protocols that you would be translating to the Cardano ecosystem. I understand this is a demonstration project so you would need a lot of pieces in place already for this to be successful.
5.  The proposers have a team of 6 with diverse and relevant skills and experience. The proposal materials are professionally delivered.
6.  The team has appropriately identified clear deliverables and constrained scope to manage the project to time constraints. They have laid out a full work breakdown structure matched with the skills and experience required to tackle this project. There remains a level of risk due to the key learnings required and lack of maturity of this technology. The team has identified these risks and included a significant amount of content development within deliverables to help mitigate this as well as limiting scope of content to introductory levels.
7.  The team looks competent but the plan is too broad and relies on too many unknowns + it overlaps with IOG own ongoing researches, it's a suboptimal use of funds until more features of Cardano are released..
8.  There is a good explanation and enough info to get a idea of the succes rate of this proposal.
9.  ""Solely based on the information provided it seems that the team has everything needed to put together a good proposal going forward.
10.  I only wonder - that's a considerate amount of money - how will team dynamics work out once it starts taking off. Clearly, they have thought about many aspects of all the project.
11.  But team having """"just"""" met this past month - it may be one unknown yet to be found out if the mix is right.
12.  """"Return: Developers are inspired to leverage the unique features of Cardano, in a way that reinforces the internal economic logic of the Cardano Network. At least one technology start-up (commercial or social) builds upon the work to target a specific market opportunity""""
13.  Understanding what and how the inspiration would come to being would be nice. Again - I get the idea generally - but would have loved more specifics.
14.  ""
15.  This project is proposing a lot in a short amount, the team is also not complete, but all this planing delivers a degree of confidence.
16.  ""The team will consist of six members with extensive experience in several areas, such as financial markets, software engineering, tech start-ups, Data & Govtech, impact investing, art, music, and education. Due to the wide range of possibilities of the proposal, I think it is important for the team to have knowledge in different areas.
17.  There is a very detailed execution plan and rational budget, consistent with the number of team members and the complexity of the proposal.""
18.  ""This is a solid team with a breadth of background. Was particularly impressed at the creative endeavours amongst them, given how relevant that is in the NFT space.
19.  Would have been nice to see slightly more blockchain dev experience on the team, but that can be fixed.""
20.  Proposal has an overabundance of information
21.  Very professionally elaborated, clear data available about (modular) deliverables, metrics for managing and auditing the progress and a clear cost calculation. The project is asking for half the money of fund 2, but it definitely deserves it. My Plan A is: Go for it, this project can be a real 'multiplier'. Plan B would be to reduce the number of (modular) deliverables and assign a smaller amount of money in fund 2. This project is so good that it will easily be able to receive more funding later on (would just be a pity to accept the resulting delays).
22.  The ambition is well defined and would be very valuable if executed well. I have concerns about how well positioned the team is to tackle this endeavor. Smart markets are incredibly important, but also incredibly complex. This is positioned as an expensive smart market experiment that I do not have high confidence will be successful.
23.  The proposal is complete and detailed; it includes KPI's, risks, and preventative measures. The proposers have been very responsive, and have set up a Telegram discussion group.
24.  The proposal is well written, clearly laid out and cross references the challenge appropriately. Proposal content is provided in summary level via .ppt, intent is clearly communicated in the attached video and more detailed documentation is provided for a deeper dive. The proposal has identified a team with the requisite skills to complete this project and the project has the requisite deliverables to engage the developer community and springboard additional development in the use of NFT's and Oracle pools. Well done!
25.  The information provided was enough to notice that it is not suited for this challenge.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  Maybe that 6 months is to ambitious. But other than that great work.
2.  It has a very well thought through agenda. Unfortunately, I am still missing KPIs on specific values so we would understand what are we benchmarking this against. Otherwise, the margin of error could be anything. And hence it is difficult to achieve real accountability on progress of the project.
3.  Yes information to assess is good, i just think would be better to breakdown this proposal, for sure some things can be delivered in other rounds.
4.  ""The roadmap was very detailed, there are defined deadlines, milestones and an objective list of deliverables.
5.  The proposal provided sufficient information to demonstrate the feasibility and impact on the fund2 proposal.""
6.  Overall a great plan that is very on point for Fund 2's goals. A well thought out proposal that looks at a spectrum of artefacts to deliver to the community, which all work in complement.

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  A support platform does not address the challenge of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
2.  Yes, a good support where you have incentives to help is a nice to have, and also target educational tool reduces the amount of time explaining details. But this proposal has a lot of challenges.
3.  The proposal targets end-users, not developers or entrepreneurs.
4.  ""The proposal addresses the public support for Cardano, where everyone can contribute. Although interesting, there are a number of already existing channels in Telegram groups, official online documentation and others as pointed out by the commentators.
5.  The proposal does not directly address the goal of Fund2 to encourage businesses or developers to work on Cardano.""
6.  A relatively noble intent behind the proposal but it does not address the challenge posed by Fund2. Requires substantially more planning and development with an effective monetary strategy.
7.  Real issue, non cohesive strategy
8.  The intention and the idea is good but as it is presented it does not meet the challenge fund2. Very little development of the proposal, it seems only an idea for now.
9.  ""The use of wallets and the need for some technical knowledge creates barriers for users with less technological knowledge.
10.  I see this problem and the need for solutions since cases of scams and loss of private keys are common in the crypto space, but it is not clear which is the solution to be sought by the project, we need more clarity on the objective of this project.""
11.  There isn't appropriate level of depth information to understand where this project is going.
12.  The proposal makes no attempt to discuss how it directly addresses the challenge. It seems true that the better experiences we can provide, there will be more developer and business attention. However, the proposals are asked to provide specific targets and metrics by which they can be measured as successful.
13.  This proposal seems pitched at consumer adoption and thus misses the mark significantly Fund 2.
14.  Does not relate to onboarding of new developers
15.  Not related to challenge topic.
16.  The proposer claims to have web, dapp, Haskell, and Plutus development experience.
17.  The proposal don't present evidence of be able to implement and to have a clear scope of the mechanisms.

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  The description is not sufficient to take this proposal seriously.
2.  ""No information about the proposer's experience has been presented or answered in the comment section.
3.  The presented idea has not been worked into details or implementation steps. Except for the general idea, no KPIs, schedule or any other workflow has been presented.
4.  It can not be determined that the proposer has the actual capacity to deliver such an ambitious project.""
5.  Lacks evidence of experience and work examples. No development plan provided and an unsubstantiated budget.
6.  no explained methodology for collecting, verifying, and hosting said data
7.  As the proposal has few details, I cannot know if it is feasible and if so much money should be allocated to it.
8.  The proposer didn't describe his experiences as a developer or projects he worked on.
9.  Cannot verify experiences and relevant personal information. A linked in profile, etc, would be suitable.
10.  ""This is an important concept to explore as we look forward to a time that we will need support for greater and greater numbers of Cardano use cases.
11.  The scope of the project is very broad. Broad enough to suggest the need of a team to implement it. There is no mention of a team.
12.  There is no implementation plan or roadmap provided. It is not possible to measure undefined goals.
13.  ""
14.  No plan or experience is presented here. Just an idea.
15.  Relevant experience but no prior work added and lacking plan for implementation
16.  Lack of seriousness of the proposal. No plan or budget described, lack of important informations like who will make that platform.
17.  The proposal does not include a roadmap, milestones, credentials, and success metrics. The problem and solution described do not address the challenge.
18.  No, this proposal needs further refinement and to prove that it has the capacity to carry out this implementation.
19.  The description is not sufficient to take this proposal seriously.

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  ""Lack of plan, schedule, cost breakdown or implementation prevents evaluation of the feasibility.
2.  The idea might be better suited for a more mature ecosystem where knowledgeable persons can help the community and be incentivized. Does not addresses the Fund2 goal effectively and lacks information to evaluate feasibility. In addition, the required ADA amount is substantial compared to the available funds.""
3.  Insufficient information to assess the feasibility or impact of this proposal.
4.  Good idea, one I've seem come up in one form or another multiple times. This proposal lacks details of the overall approach needed execute.
5.  Many details are missing. I don't know how much and where the money will be spent. Who will do it and what experience they have. How to measure progress. Among other things missing, it would be just an idea for now.
6.  ""The definition of the project's success is not clear, no deadlines have been set and the goals are very subjective since any support solution for users with private keys would be a delicate and risky issue.
7.  The budget was entered in an incorrect format and the proposer did not clarify whether he is requesting 500,000 ADAs or just 500 ADAs There is no budget breakdown.""
8.  For the amount of ADA reflected - this project is way out of its depth at the moment. There isn't enough information to consider it seriously.
9.  This proposal is a concept and will need further details before feasibility and effectiveness can be properly assesses.
10.  This is just an idea. Significantly more information is required.
11.  Very lacking in business plan, implementation plan and plan for onboarding developers.
12.  Insufficient informations about the proposal, no roadmap, no demo, any materials to check auditability

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

Its a interesting idea but i'm having a hard time trying to understand how this project will help developers and entrepreneurs in the next six months. This project will be open source? Will have tutorials to other developers be able to learn with replication? This proposal seams a bit incomplete and leave this open questions.

A mobile app where developers can pay to get their questions answered more quickly could encourage developers to build on Cardano.

This project has an interesting idea because it addresses a real problem. Youtube has implemented the option of superchats to highlight comments from people who want attention and it is something similar to what this proposal proposes to do, but it is not clear how this proposal is related to the challenge of fund2.

The proposal does not aim to solve Fund2 Challenge statement, but rather, seeks to deploy a feature that will enable to boost commentary visibility.

It might help a few people get their questions answered, but it does not seem to be a real issue in the ecosystem today, and hence is not expected to actually bring any developer adoption.

""I am having issues identifying information that would help me determine answer to the:

""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""

Absent of that - unsure about suitability for this particular round. However, idea could have merit under different circumstances.""

I can't see how this proposal falls in line with the goals for Fund 2.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

Yes, it seams this company is capable to deliver a very nice product, but we don't have KPIs for the challenge, just for app utilization.

The proposer claims to have 7 years of mobile app development and project management experience.

""The proposer mentioned 7 years of experience as an app developer, but didn' not provide any reference so that we could evaluate his work. This project requires the creation of smart contracts and the proposer did not mention having experience with programming in blockchains / smart contracts. He mentions that the project will have a development team but it is not defined how many people or what their knowledge / experience is.

There are some goals and deadlines, and this should help the development follow up by the community. The budget was divided into 4 allocations and the division of funds between them was described without further details.""

The proposer claims to have experience building mobile applications, thus increasing the likelihood of project development.

Prior app work but no given experience with blockchain or implementation of smart contracts.

I am unable to determine how to verify the experience factor. It is missing outside of the web-site submitted.

The proposed timeline is fairly simplistic for a team of one person. It would be good to see more data on how the blockchain/backend elements of the proposal are supposed to function.

The person behind the project seems very knowledgeable in web and mobile design. The necessary experience is there.

Instead of creating an app for every platform it looks wiser to me to start with the easiest an cheapest platform. I guess this is a webversion. Maybe repost this project in a next round of proposals?

I think we need more information to understand how it will addresses the challenge.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

Past work on mobile apps would be useful for feasibility assessment. Business idea should be validated first or at a reasonable cost. Business growth and development expansion projections would be useful for impact assessment.

The Project has defined goals and objectives and can be followed by the community, but there are no indications of how this will be relevant to the fund2.

The proposal provides some information on budget and timeline breakdown, however, it does not go into specifics on how it aims to solve Fund2 Challenge statement.

Some questions might get answered, but it does not entail actual developer onboarding.

""Very basic budgetary and milestone values are provided.

It doesn't really address issue of how the app will attract developers and actual use cases. We don't know if there is a demand for it - knowing some market research basics if this is feasible would be beneficial to understand the need or lack of respectively.""

Off topic for Fund 2 and the proposal needs more work if it to be resubmitted in later funding rounds. More detail on blockchain… and (opinion only) perhaps consider whether some element of charitable donation would work better than paying mentors to answer questions.

The underlying assumption seems misguided. Just because a person has the ADA to spend in a question, it does not mean it will be a good one. There is no mention of how long a question has before the refund is triggered. Or how/who curates them based on the additional criteria? Or where these criteria will be decided?

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  A well executed game could be an interesting use case for Cardano. However, for this to effectively meet the challenge this needs to clearly demonstrate why a POC would help bring in new developers, businesses, etc. POCs are interesting, but for this to be an effective proposal it would clearly need to demonstrate an additive or (ideally) a multiplicative effect for achieving the challenge.
2.  Funding Cardano game development is one way of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
3.  The proposal will/might attract more users (who are gamers) but no devs which defeats the challenge.
4.  great idea and furthers the adoption of cardano
5.  A gaming platform for others to build on will raise awareness of blockchain development
6.  ""I can appreciate the concept but I don't understand the relationship with the fund round theme beyond the initial team of developer(s) to make this game. There is missing link between the two or these are no readily visible.
7.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"""" ""
8.  ""The idea of blockchain based gaming has a huge potential and a whole new world for daps. Based on PoC, this project will bring a team of developers and extra some engineers that will develop the basic game in that 6 months period. Low number of developers, but the potential for attracting much more, once the game runs.
9.  I would like to see NFTs and a more creatively detailed game idea.""
10.  The proposal aims to integrate gaming experience powered by blockchain ledger. This has the potential to act as a template for what gaming could potentially look like on Cardano, thus attracting people from the industry to come and innovate on the platform.
11.  No real consideration given to how this would attract developers to Cardano… other than because someone else did a 'cool thing'. Also no addressing of IP in the proposal, so how would the chain even benefit if people paid attention?
12.  Given the author's experience and the experience of the team, it seems that this POC would be executed successfully.
13.  The proposer claims to have a team with 10+ years of software engineering experience and game development experience. They propose hiring a part-time engineer.
14.  There's experience and the game proposed (as such) just might work however the numbers don't match ""The cost of software development would be $60K USD for both stages of the proof-of-concept"" while the breakdown clearly says 15k$/stage making it 30k$ in total. There's 30k difference…
15.  Very well laid out plan

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  10yrs in game development and masters degree. Relatively high probability that this proposal will be implemented successfully.
2.  The game doesn't have to be good for this to have benefit,
3.  ""Beyond knowing that person runs an active stake pool - I have no understanding who the people are and their experience as claimed is. A linked in profile or actual profiles would have helped understand the link better.
4.  As it stands - it is questionable who will be receiving funds and how to hold them accountable if something goes sideways. ""
5.  ""+ The team states 10+ years development experience.
6.  \+ Game state chain is well defined and clearly thought trough.
7.  \+ No doubt blockchain side of the game will be done in 6 months period
8.  \+ Reasonable budget plan
9.  \- No mention of size of the team, a big team of developers might finish the PoC in a month""
10.  The proposer claims to have extensive experience in gaming development, however, given the size of the project, the team might need additional human resources to deliver quality content on time.
11.  ""More research is required to even establish if this will work. It hasn't been shown how data would even be encoded in block transactions… nor whether it is a good idea to do this in the base chain… which it seems to me it is not.
12.  There is the hint of something cool here… but perhaps return in another funding round with some research on the pros and cons of a sidechain implementation and how the transaction model will translate into bytes of block data… and therefore the 'cost to carry' on the chain.""
13.  This POC focuses too much on delivering a game rather than meeting the challenge. It would be vital that this POC would achieve the challenge and that could be done through many ways, perhaps making the POC development a community or open source effort. This would draw in game developers and provide them a way to build out the POC and experience how Cardano/blockchain could be integrated. For this to get a five rating for me, it would have to clearly meet the challenge through the six month effort. I've provided some ideas above, but those are just the beginning of what is possible.
14.  The proposal does not include credentials, and success metrics. Past work on games would be useful for feasibility assessment. Business growth and development expansion projections would be useful for impact assessment.
15.  The timeline seems feasible and they have already started to think about the whole process (different blocks to be used within and on top of the blockchain) as well as game design but the budget doesn't match (see above)
16.  Funding this round

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  Plan is properly laid out in stages and funding required for each stage, however the key risks to implementation aren't really discussed in the proposal.
2.  ""Completely feasible and creates a basis for growth.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

I agree this enthusiastic proposal addresses our challenge to be fair.

An Ethereum bridge is proposed. The proposal could illustrate some use cases and explain how this would encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.

Yes having a bridge with ethereum can help other developers to onboard in Cardano.

""It is clear that there is a good use case - but I am unable to determine where project is making adequate effort to explain:

""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""

It seems like this project will make a good use case after the above time frame instead of before? That clarification would have been helpful already in the proposal.""

""The fundamental idea is appealing but it is difficult to believe this proposal will be effective, given the proposer has extremely limited blockchain experience and is still seeking a lead developer to solve a fairly complicated problem.

I would suggest refining this plan when you find some collaborators and resubmit in a later funding round.""

A bridge connecting Ethereum to Cardano is very desirable. Though calling Ethereum a legacy chain is not a good start. A lot of people may begrudge that description.

Bridges are needed

It is highly unlikely that this proposal will be implemented by proposer given the lack of information provided as to the solution of proposed idea

The proposer has 2 years of software development experience and has completed a coding boot camp. They propose hiring a lead developer and a business HR manager within a month to build a website and prototype on 25% of the 50000 ada budget.

Where is the full plan? Why we should aprove a partial proposal if we don't know the extent of this project? What is the relation of the company in this proposal with the proponent? i Think we need better clarification in this proposal so we can advance. Also i think a list of functionalities as outcome of this implementation can be provide to better understanding and also as a milestones.

""I am unsure who would be accountable for this project, nor who additional team members may be. I would have liked to see actual references that would point to Mr. Manning vs. Smurf, etc.

It would be useful to have this proposal thought through a bit more. Seems that this is not a job for just one person but a proper team. It would likely make sense to team up effort with other community members to see it through. ""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

There is not team behind this project and only a very minimal plan.

There is a background in programming, but not very blockchain specific. Their Github is very populated by opp languages and web design. Not much in the way of functional languages, or Solidity appears.

The information given is very vague and does not warrant any grants to be awarded as it is being proposed (budget, feasibility, etc.) in my opinion. Voters will have to decide about the seriousness of such proposal for themselves..

Software development, business experience, and a marketing plan to acquire the goal of 100 users in the first month would be useful for feasibility assessment. A shortlist of users would be useful for impact assessment.

This proposal addresses the challenge but we are lacking information to better assess this proposal.

""I am not confident that this proposal provides appropriate level of depth detail in timeline and budgetary requirements. There are some contradictory items such as a million dollar remark to get this done in a year - but then 50,000 ADA in request.

There needs to be some more unified information so that it shows confidence.

I am also missing budget breakdown individually. I find it insufficient to read:

""""Budget will be spent finding a lead developer and business HR manager for the start of the project,""""

This should be plausible ahead so that funds can be used to actual work on project itself?""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

This plan needs to be matured with a deeper team structure.

There is a roadmap provided and meaningful metrics in it. Though the proposal lacks some technical details on would this bridgework, and for what types of assets,

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  The proposal doesn't have a clearly defined way on how to attract developers and businesses to Cardano. It does potentially support future DeFi projects but it is unrealistic to expect it in the next 6 months.
2.  ""The stated timeline on development of this proposal's outcome is 9 months. This means that the product delivery is outside of the 6 month timeline for the challenge.
3.  However; It could be said that the prospect of this product coming online in the future, would attract developers who may wish to speculate on its successful completion.""
4.  Yes this project allows entrepreneurs to build better credit system on top of DeFi applications.
5.  clear solution to proposed problem
6.  The information you provide seems to be very useful for those who develop a loan system and those who take it. But there are many details that have not been incorporated into the proposal despite having received suggestions. Although economic stimulus is always needed to continue growing, in the proposal I see that you are a company established and in operation and I am not sure if you need the support of fund 2 to provide the service you want in Cardano.
7.  Bringing something in the credit score space to Cardano seems of merit for attract people to build on it… unfortunately this proposal is very vague on the specific nature of credmark integration proposed.
8.  ""I like the idea of having credit scores that could roam internationally. However, the proposal doesn't make it apparent what the link is between the scope of the challenge this round and its actual goal.
9.  I can appreciate the idea - but how are we going to go beyond credmark institution. How do we push that adoption further? Few more words on that would have helped to make that connection easier. ""
10.  The proposal offers to create a blockchain wide credit score benchmark in order to facilitate the ease of global financial movement. This could attract entrepreneurs and developers from many industries if they know they have a safe base to work on top of.
11.  A credit score is an important problem and solving it will open the gates to unsecured loans in the blockchain.
12.  The proposer is working with lenders to build Ethereum loan products. The development cost is shared by both Credmark and the budget requested.
13.  Experience is there, products are well defined, quarterly reports are out since Q2 2019 up to now. However the plan is not clearly defined and milestones are missing.
14.  ""The team has shown capabilities and successes on other chains. It would help if there were metrics for how many developers & businesses on the other chains are using the product.
15.  The proposal lacks a clear roadmap of development, costs associated, as well as targets of adoption. These are required elements of a proposal if we are to assess its feasibility and success metrics.
16.  ""
17.  We need to understand better how will be the execution plan for this specific integration. This proposal approach oracles in Cardano, we don't have any clear date for this too.

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  If it already implemented on other networks, the foundation is laid and proposer has established team
2.  The proposal seems to be able to be implemented successfully but as part of the activities that Credmark already carries out, without the need for support from Fund 2.
3.  There is no real plan here, or information on the team.
4.  I am unable to establish credibility for experience beyond the website. A linked in profile or some sort of other reference to understand who Paul is would be wonderful. Otherwise - I don't know who or what receives funds exactly.
5.  The proposer claims to have over 10 years of experience in the financial sector and is willing to forego some of the expenses required to finish the project. Further community funding will be required if the proposer fails to come up with the funds to finalize the product.
6.  The team has a lot of financial experience. Not only in the financial world but also in the loan industry in particular. Though, I don't see any blockchain developers on their website.
7.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, and credentials. Potential clients that would use Credmark's Cardano credit data products would help assess whether the project was implemented successfully. Business growth and development expansion projections would be useful for impact assessment.
8.  The proposal does not state or address the challenge exactly and the feasibility is difficult to determine without a more detailed plan.
9.  The proposal does not provide metrics by which to measure how many developers or businesses will be attracted to Cardano. There is no timeline with client acquisition targets. Nor does the proposal describe client acquisition marketing efforts.
10.  This proposal lacks information about the execution but strong addresses the challenge.
11.  approach seems viable.
12.  Despite being an already established company, they have not given the necessary details to measure the impact and progress of the proposal, or where the money will be spent. In addition, it is necessary to detail what would be achieved in 6 months, which is the objective of fund2.
13.  ""There isn't enough information in this proposal to even provide meaningful feedback.
14.  In future funding rounds it would be worth adding more information on things like team composition; some details of things to be built; more concrete information on timeframes.""

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  I cannot rely on the simple sentence:
2.  """"We are asking for 500K ADA because we have a good idea of how much work this will involve.""""
3.  Followed by three small bullet points.
4.  It is a good executive summary but I need to see under the hood to judge if this is feasible.
5.  ""
6.  The proposal provides some information on timeline breakdowns but lacks detail on the budget breakdown. More clarity on how this would drive the industry professionals to Cardano would be welcome.
7.  The proposal demonstrates a deep knowledge of the credit/loan industry. But there is a lack of technical detail on the development side. It just briefly mention cross-chain connections with Ethereum and Oracle pools.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

Fails to address challenge.

Generals very good idea, but rather vague. No direct link with the scope of Fund 2 described, not even an indication of how this could contribute indirectly in the required short time-frame. This project is not sufficiently addressing the challenge of this Fund 2, but might - after careful refinement and finding the right team - have great potential in a future Fund.

This proposal is incomplete for assessment, lacks information.

""The proposal gives reasoning how demonstration of successful voting in Switzerland can draw attention to Cardano.

I would advise to also address how this could inspire entrepreneurs and developers to use Cardano for their endeavours. While this might be obvious to some it is probably not for everyone.

I like the idea and proposal as such and see room for improvement for another round.""

Migrating the Swiss voting system to Cardano is proposed. The proposal does not address the challenge of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.

""I like this idea, there is a greater demand now for remote voting. The idea of providing a voting system through the blockchain has been in Cardano's plans for a long time, this article talks more about it:

https://medium.com/@hiboat/how-cardona-will-help-to- improve-the-electoral-systems-in-africa-f6525f6f2c7c.

This can be a step to support other countries that need to change the voting system and this should attract new people to develop at Cardano.""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

""This proposal misses the mark on the fund3 challenge theme:

""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"""" ""

Off topic for Fund 2.

Little to no plan given.

No related experience on side of the proposer. No team listed. Lack of evidence of technical skills and of the required political network and/or involvement of the required legal expertise

proposal lacks methodology

I cant assess this because we dont have any execution plan.

""The proposer has no experience stated and there is no roadmap on how to implement a voting solution within a 6 month time frame.

For a next iteration, it could be interesting to do a pre-project to just research if there are Kantone that would be interested to test voting through Cardano (maybe Zug) and to check the legal side. This would then directly increase the chance of success for an implementation project and increase transparency by presenting possible partners.""

The proposal is just an idea; there is no plan.

""The proposer didn't indicate any previous experience and also didn't indicate if he will count on the help of someone to develop this project.

There is no description of planning or budget present in the proposal.""

Based on lack of information - unable to determine.

No real plan here. It is a vague idea.

Not feasible within 6 months.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

Only background material provided is a link to a CRYPTOTIPS article, which is quoting a Swiss Government strategy paper referring to Cardano and Algorand as interesting protocols. No effort invested to provide the required details. No activity planning, no roadmap, no definition of success, no cost-breakdown. Looks like the proposer her/himself did not believe that this matches with the scope of Fund 2.

proposal lacks any methodology for implementation

No

""Since there is no information given on how the project is planned to be implemented and lacks examples of how the implementation could be used to draw in new developers and entrepreneurs, the feasibility can not be assessed.

To improve that for a next round, the following information would be of value:

\- Roadmap with milestones, optimally including a timeline

\- Minimal goal that is expected to be achieved e.g. voting in one Kanton, or successful test of the voting system etc.

\- Cost breakdown -> How much time of the team is needed, how much hourly rate do they want to pay themselves. What external costs are expected?

\- Description of how the implementation of the voting will be used to attract more people do build Dapps on Cardano (passively through media coverage, bundled with marketing campaign, interviews, etc.)""

The proposal is just an idea; there is no plan.

As there is no detail on the planning and no amount was requested for the budget, it doesn't make sense to further evaluate the proposal.

Proposal doesn't go into appropriate level of depth and details to make any meaningful observations. It is also missing budgetary requirements all together.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

Building a hub does not address challenge.

An offline space could foster collaboration among Cardano developers, but wouldn't scale due to its local nature.

""This proposal seems to be aligned with the objective of fund2. The existence of this space can encourage the organization of meetups and hackathons, but it has not been demonstrated how a physical location can bring additional benefits in events over the internet, through video conferences. Today the vast majority of events related to blockchain occur over the internet due to the restrictions imposed by covid-19 and this is a problem that cannot be ignored when evaluating this proposal.

Many people have avoided social contact and governments have placed measures to restrict agglomerations in public places. This week (last week of October) there was news of rising cases and some countries in Europe are taking restrictive measures of social distancing.

In addition, this proposal is requesting almost half of the resources of fund2 and there are no justifications present in this proposal that justify such a huge commitment from fund2.

I suggest postponing this proposal to the next funds, when there is a larger budget and we are more confident that the situation of covid-19 is under control.""

A meetup hub will be hard to get up and running in the next 6 months with COVID raging. Many countries impose a limit on how many people can be together in a group, which will hurt such a hub. Apart from that, a meetup space is more of a longtail project, and it will be hard to get developers building on Cardano within 6 months through this idea.

Hubs for community and developers are aligned with the fund goal.

""Would have given higher rating but under current circumstances - I don't see how this project can fulfil:

""""Cardano Hub - your key to the future. Hub will include meetup space, co-working, library, media, cafe, bookstore, startup accelerator, etc.""""

Countries are locking down, home office, etc. I don't see this proposal can live up to its expectations during present round at all.

Regardless, I like the idea in general.""

This idea is great i think we need to have more exposure to locals, but i don't know how this can be done to attract developers in the next 6 months with this pandemic going on.

The nature of this proposal is well aligned with Fund 2's goals to bring devs and entrepreneurs onto the platform. It is the 'effectiveness' aspect of scoring that lets it down, based on the other assessments below.

The amount of ADA ask is too low. You are either going to rent or buy location. Fails to say how it will maintain sustainability, to be able to pay rent, utilities, etc

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

The proposal could be fleshed out further; it has lots of ideas and maybes but little is concrete.

""There is no further detail regarding the proposer's professional experience and knowledge, there is only one mention about the creation of a bar in 2019 that served as a meeting point for the crypto community.

There is no detailed plan for how the Cardano hub will engage the developer community in a practical way, mainly because many people are in social isolation due to covid-19. There is no detailed budget allocation.""

The experience is a great plus, since something very much like thing was implemented prior. It is however not a given that people will adopt the idea of a Cardano Hub, and actually meet up. The is some risk that the incentive is not great enough, and it might take a lot of marketing to draw people in.

The plan looks interesting, but the requested funding is way too much for this type of proposal.

""Based on the track record of the person - that is involvement - this would be very likely possible to entertain.

However, plan does not take into account current Covid-19 situation which makes this proposal impossible to implement with desirable level of success. This can be a contender in later rounds when there is more clarity. ""

The plan can be improved a lot, i bet there is a lot of ppl that can bring a plan for doing a combined hub, even with some shared profit and costs.

There's an idea here, but not a concrete plan. There is no factual basis presented to assert that the financials for the physical premises would be sustainable.

Can't be done within 6 months, and fails to meet the overall challenge of bringing developers and entrepreneurs to Cardano.

Visitor metrics for the previous cryptobar would be useful for both feasibility and impact assessment. Some skin in the game would have improved the proposal significantly. For example, photos of spaces, cost breakdowns, whether alternatives were considered. Many projects get by fine with meetups hosted at company offices.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

""There is not enough information to assess the project's impact and viability in fund2.

The requested budget was 888 888 ADAs, which corresponds to almost half of the fund2 and there was no detail on the allocation of funds. It is important that the community has a good description of how the funds will be allocated. The requested budget would be for 1 year of operation of the Cardano Hub, which exceeds the 6-month period defined in fund2 to meet the challenge.""

This is no budget to be found, and no forecasting or modelling for how many people it will attract and hence how many projects would be started on Cardano within the next 6 months.

There are no milestones, metrics or KPIs present in the proposal

""Unfortunately, proposal does not go into any depth or detail how the proposed budgetary value actually makes sense and where it will be allocated.

""

I think we need a better plan, more ppl thinking about how to bring this to really in a sustainable way. What we need to be in place first to be able to achieve sustainability?

This plan needs to be substantially fleshed out before it would allay risks that the Treasury funds wouldn't be lost in a failed business.

6.  I don't see the problems relevance to the funding round
7.  Great idea to engage both the fledgling and more experienced game development community. I anticipate it will take more than 6 months to develop and there are no measurable metrics provided to assess ROI.
8.  The ability to attract devs and entrepreneurs to Cardano was a long shot at best with the basic idea, but the real death blow is both the client and server currently have GPL licenses slapped on them, which are very commercially unfriendly licenses.
9.  ""I generally like where this is headed. I would have liked to know more about how this will be popularised.

11.  I think that would be crucial under the theme of the project scope ""
12.  The proposal doesn't address the fund2 challenge objective, the project solution does not explain use of Cardano. The projects probable integration of cardano has no clear path or feasible solution.
13.  ""The plan could be relevant for a specific and large user group: gamers.
14.  The impact of the proposal seems not so much about encouraging developers and entrepeneurs. It's about the learning curve on how to do various technical and operational actions related to creating and running a game with Cardano. There seems to be some connection to developers, not entrepeneurs.
15.  A valuable addition could be to integrate in this proposal an answer to the following question: how can game developers and game entrepeneurs be encouraged to work with Cardano? ""
16.  I like the idea, but its seems more like a concept for someone to pick, than serious propose.
17.  A blockchain enabled game engine would make it much easier for developers to start building games on Cardano
18.  Plan very well laid out and complete

1.  Lack of detail presented in the description. Hard to pinpoint what Proposer's role will be and who will carry out the task in case of the main actor's absence.
2.  I think the plan, roadmap and partners need to be better explained in this proposal. I miss the understanding how each step will lead to a final product. What will be possible to execute as a developer in each step? Need more information about the plan.
3.  I'm certain it can be built but I do not see why here and now
4.  Relevant experience and examples of work provided. Following your admirable honesty, you have yet to ""figure out how to make the game engine to be interoperable with the Cardano"". As such, it is impossible to ascertain if your proposal can be implemented to it's finality.
5.  ""There isn't much of a plan here. Given the background of work undertaken previously, I suspect that Tevo has the persistence to keep pushing forward with this, but not in six months with the small amount of funds requested… and no plan.
6.  It would have helped the proposal considerably to have a team formed before (or during) submission. Not expecting to form a team after approval.""
7.  ""There is enthusiasm present. However, project doesn't allow for the appropriate level of depth to understand.
8.  There is a lot of wishes expressed but plan isn't fully outlined to take it seriously to the next level. ""

10.  ""Tevo seems to have experience with writing game scripts and game systems. There is a link to the Github repository where projects contents can be found. I did not explore the Github content. Could it be possible that you make it easier to assess your credentials and experience?
11.  Tevo is a one man band now and needs to find a team to start the project. It would be adviced that the team is available before voting starts. Just supporting Tevo could be risky.
12.  There is still doubt on the scope of the project as the question is still open to create a pixel art shop, where pixel artist can tokenize art and game creators can buy the art. This possible additional project integrates artists and game developers. Maybe it's an idea that you focus on this project as an proposel? It seems focussed measurable and limited in scope. ""

15.  Uncertainties in the plan and somewhat lacking experience

17.  Potential to attract developers in the future to build similair project should this proposal materialize. Lack of timeline and budget spending makes it difficult to asses how viable this idea is at the moment in Cardano.
18.  Yes it is clear how effectively addresses the challenge but it lacks information about the feasibility.
19.  THe team will be paid in ADA but it is not clearly described how the ecosystem will benefit from this, while I think it should be easy to implement ADA in the game as token to purchage objects of use a ADA fee to play the game. I could not find anything about this in the documentation
20.  Maybe I'm lost, but I don't see how this affects Cardano for good or bad.
21.  Proposal addresses the challenge but lacks a key ingredient to the solution. No roadmap and milestones provided. Insufficient material to assess feasibility and impact of proposal.

Describe your solution to the problem :

""""Create and distribute content - video programs, and then text versions based on them.""""

I don't know how that fits with the dFund2 narrative:

""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""

I think this Proposer falls in the scope of the Ambassador program.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

I find it difficult to score podcasts highly given the scope of Fund 2, but I'll give this one a small bump because of the language translation aspects as well.

Proposal looks to have decent experience as a content creator.

The proposer has been publishing Cardano YouTube videos, though 2 videos a week would be quite the step up from the current release cadence. The proposer has also submitted another proposal to fund an offline community space.

The author is already providing content and is building a community but doesn't seem to have a lot of subscribers yet.

""The proposer has 3 years of experience with creating content related to cryptocurrencies, but his YouTube channel has few subscribers and views. It is not clear how the proposer will expand his audience.

The proposal is to create 2 videos per week during the period of 6 months. The content to be produced will address discussion on governance, trading, dapps, marketing and interviews … What I consider to be very broad in scope and nothing indicates that it will reach a relevant number of developers and entrepreneurs. I consider the requested budget compatible with the proposal, but there is a lack of details on how the funds will be allocated.""

The plan is detailed, the proposer has relevant experience.

""I like there are existing channels that person can leverage. That suggests good competency.

Couple additional points:

It would be beneficial to link these for verification.

What I would like is more clarity in language. For example, """"we will at least 2 episodes per week"""" - but then it says hopefully more. I don't think that conveys the right message when communicating in funding requests. This needs to be anchored firmly to know exactly what the expectations are. ""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

I don't think Andrii's videos are quite as polished as some of the other podcasts in the Cardano community, but he has a good tech focus. If funding is unsuccessful in this round I would encourage him to consider a collaborative proposal in future rounds.

Fails to give budget information on equipment and software needed to create content. Needs more followers on media channels to reach developers.

Audience engagement metrics and profiling would be useful for impact assessment.

It would have been great to have statistics on the current audience growing rate and more links to existing content to properly assess the author skill set.

""There are several content creators who bring information about Cardano regularly, the proposal doesn't explain how it will stand out among the content that is already created by the community and this is important, because the only premise that justifies this project to have an impact on fund2 is through the dissemination and sharing of videos / podcasts so that this material can reach developers and entrepreneurs .

The proposer didn't indicate how the community can assess the project's development and success. I think it is important that metrics about channels are released regularly to the community.""

There are no milestones, metrics or KPIs present in the proposal

""Inadequate depth of detail on budgetary requirements. I see it has been revised based on comments from community. But I don't understand the relevancy of commentary on multiple changes.

It would be best to spend most energy on defending that ONE value and laying down reasoning that supports it. Unfortunately, I don't understand budgetary requirement that read like this:

""""(I thought to lover it to 77K as I mentioned in the comment, but after speaking with Ambassador Maria Carmo, I decided to agree with her suggestion and to put the amount which would be more or less equal to 10K of USD.""""

That somehow can suggest that number is arbitrary. ""

Content selection is good and certainly Andrii is capable of delivering videos. Just not in a strong alignment with Fund 2 right now.

04/Nov/20 6:47 PM,324126,1839,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  The proposal aims to lower the entry barrier for developers with little experience in Plutus. This could encourage more industry experienced developers to migrate over to Cardano platform.
2.  A KEVM and IELE feasibility study is proposed to facilitate the migration of Solidity devs to Cardano.
3.  I'm not sure if this fully addresses the challenge, bringing in ETH-devs is fine but we should focus more broadly outside ETH-blockchain.
4.  This proposal is incomplete and the respective projects seems to be restarted by IOG.
5.  cohesive solution to stated problem
6.  Although this proposal seemingly directly addresses our challenge it is entirely misleading. Let me reason Charles already announced the revival of the project and the amount required to do so is in whole different region. I can not attest to the intention of the proposer but it is not a viable proposal to be funded from the treasury as whole larger scope of work has been commissioned by Charles anyways for no cost to the Cardano ecosystem.
7.  This proposal is promising and the continuity of work on the development of KEVM & IELE would allow integration with many projects that are on Ethereum. But IOG recently announced that they are already working on this project, which makes this proposal redundant. Some community members questioned the proposer about this but no response was provided so far (10/26/2020).
8.  This is very difficult to judge. The idea behind the proposal seems on point… but the actual proposal is missing substantial details that would be needed to establish how 'effective' this particular phase would be.
9.  IOHK have contracted Runtime Verification to continuing the development of KEVM and IELE, further funding through fund2 challenge is not necessary at this stage.
10.  The project scope doesn't go into much detail how exactly this effort will help drive the adoption. It only states we should allocate treasury funds and that's about it.
11.  This will make the transition to Plutus easier
12.  Relevant experience and low cost requirement, however no mention of the timeline or team members involved. Solo/team project?
13.  IOG is already funding Runtime Verification for related work.
14.  The team is very experienced and the info on this project is also well known to some inside Cardano community. See https://testnets.cardano.org/en/more/

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  No
2.  integration in imperative to developer adoption of Cardoano
3.  This proposal as a revival effort is entirely not needed as the project has been renewed in much larger scope than proposed here..
4.  ""The proposer did not give details about his experience, just put a link from https://runtimeverification.com/
5.  IOG announced a few days ago that it already has an agreement with RunTime Verification for work on the development of KEVM & IELE.
6.  There is no detail about the plan or goals and as the IOG already has an agreement to develop the resolution of this problem, I see no sense in financing this project.""
7.  There is no background information put forward specific to the proposer/proposal which can establish provenance. Just links to pre-existing resources and community discussions.
8.  IOHK have contracted Runtime Verification to continuing the development of KEVM and IELE, further funding through fund2 challenge is not necessary at this stage.
9.  Proposal is submitted by Kodex Data - then there is mention of one gentleman at Runtime Verification. Who would be actually accountable for the project success? I am confused. The project ownership path isn't entirely clear.
10.  No clear plan or assurance that this will be possible or the budget will be enough.
11.  High ROI, great potential if implemented.
12.  As mentioned by a previous commenter, Charles posted a tweet saying they signed a 7 figure contract with Runtime Verification to continue work on IELE. This would make this proposal redundant.
13.  The proposal does not include a roadmap, milestones, credentials, and success metrics.
14.  I don't see any plans, timeline and also Charles mentioned a 7-figure deal to revive IELE so I'm not sure why is this proposed here. To be double-checked to avoid overlaps.

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  Though I do not understand the tech, it seems a logical and viable approach.
2.  There is just no need for this proposal to be implemented as Charles already commisioned renewal of the IELE, KEVM in much larger scope…funding this is not a reasonable think to do
3.  There is a conflict of information that was not clarified by the proposer and it seems that the problem that originated this proposal is already being solved by the IOG.
4.  Substantial information missing from this proposal that would be needed to assess it properly. It is a promising idea, but the substance of the proposal writeup is lacking.
5.  IOHK have contracted Runtime Verification to continuing the development of KEVM and IELE, further funding through fund2 challenge is not necessary at this stage.
6.  ""Project lacks appropriate level of detail to understand what will be funded exactly.
7.  Also, isn't runtime verification under contract with IOG already? I would have liked to hear that mentioned in the proposal under interests. ""
8.  Very lacking on feasibility information

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

Way out of scope of the challenge.

The proposal does not effectively address the challenge in an immediate fashion, rather it formulates its own aim. This aim does not very naturally encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months

This proposal can be very attractive for academics but i'm having a hard time thinking how this proposal will attract developer and business to build on cardano in the next 6 months.

In my opinion this particular proposal doesn't address the Fund2 challenge statement of attracting developers to the ecosystem. Maybe such initiatives are worth exploring in future funds.

A feasibility study for small sat based telescopes does not address the challenge of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.

""It wasn't clear what is the problem that this proposal seeks to solve, it needs more detail.

The proposer wants to create a research for the feasibility of using small-scale space telescopes and possibly build these telescopes in future stages, if the research demonstrates the feasibility.

The idea of integrating a payment system and integrating ADA into that system was mentioned.

The relationship of this proposal with the objective of fund2 is not explained by the proposer.""

""I do not understand the connection with the fund's theme:

""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""

and launching satellites. ""

A very interesting idea taking Cardano to the final frontier but it does not directly address the challenge of Fund2. This proposal may be applicable much later on with the research already conducted.

Off topic for Fund 2.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

Based off the proposal, it is highly unlikely that this will be implemented successfully. Need more money and bigger more experienced team.

This aim is not manifestly characterized by a sensible plan and budget for the task described, it is more aspirational than practical.

This proposal still in idealization phase and don't have detailed plan in how the execution will occur.

""With the information provided and the level of complexity of such an initiative I think it is highly unlikely the proposal can be successful.

Also I'm not sure what would be the direct benefit to Cardano and its ecosystem considering the stage of development. We are still very early in our journey, we need to focus on more stringent issues and impactful initiatives.""

The proposal is just an idea; there is no plan.

""The proposer described some previous experiences in line with the proposal's interest, but did not detail how much experience he has.

The proposer indicated that he would use his network of contacts in the Astronomy community to conduct the research. As the proposal is to finance a research I think it is important that we have data on the academic background of who will be involved in these researches.

There is no explanation of how the research will be conducted or details of how the budget of 500 000 ADAs will be employed.""

Proposal does not establish appropriate level of experience verification that could support claims. Thus, unable to determine implementation success.

Whilst I appreciate your experience and contacts at SpaceX, the large budget requested appears to be for research purposes with little assurance of a successful solution.

A very vague plan, plus it is uncertain what is in scope for Fund 2.

Not feasible within 6 month timeline and does not address the challenge within scope.

My assessment is that the proposal does not provide sufficient information on its feasibility and approaches a more wishful thinking approach to success. It might benefit from a more focused and targeted approach with a clear team-oriented strategy in one of the later stage funding rounds.

No, this proposal need to be improved

""The proposal lacks details to assess its feasibility.

Also I'm not able to connect the dots between the goal of this proposal and the mission of Fund2 challenge. ""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

The proposal is just an idea; there is no plan.

""I consider it important that the community has a breakdown of how the money will be allocated, mainly due to the fact that the project is requesting 25% of the total fund2.

It has not been described how this project will solve the challenge of fund2.

No milestones have been described that the community can follow.

In general, the proposal needs to be more refined so that the community can better assess the impact of this project.""

Proposal does not go into appropriate depth in tackling financials of this proposal nor viable timelines. More information is needed to consider this seriously.

Insufficient information to assess feasibility or impact of proposal.

Off topic and insufficient detail provided.

04/Nov/20 6:45 PM,324144,1844,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  Idea creator targets general population with marketing, does not look to attract developers to stimulate on chain development.
2.  A micronation does not address the challenge of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
3.  The fund2 challenge is about targeting businesses and developers to build stuff on top of the Cardano platform in ""6 months"". It especially targets the business and developers, not the general public. I don't think businesses will get the risk to incorporate the business on the island. Besides there are existing islands for tax haven purposes.
4.  Absolutely irrelevant, nothing to do with attracting the devs.
5.  It addresses the challenge by allowing the invitation of developers to the island for hackathons. etc. Also simplifies a plethora of other activity. This is independent of whether I think there are better alternatives.
6.  Charming idea, but neither in scope, time-frame nor available funding suitable for Fund 2. I also want to alert that founding micro-nations has been tried multiple times, with mostly devastating results for the activist(s). This is no small mission and the PR outcome is highly insecure and risky.
7.  An interesting proposal but it does not directly address the challenge of Fund2.
8.  This proposal unfortunately does not address current chalenge at all although it is highly exciting idea to indulge as a Cardano supporter
9.  It's a fun idea and interesting project, which could bring some attention to Cardano. However the funds demanded could better serve businesses and projects that actually want to build value on the blockchain rather than a PR stunt. And I doubt many people would actually want to move over and live on a island.
10.  As stated by Dor Garbash in the weekly Town Hall on 7/10/2020, proposals that exceed the budget will be automatically rejected, so there is no need for further evaluation.
11.  Off topic for Fund 2
12.  Maybe it would be a lot of publicity. But I don't think it is meeting the needs of fund 2.
13.  Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully
14.  The proposal objective is to market Cardano, thus proposal is not in scope of Fund2 challenge.
15.  It brings a lot of noise, but might not attract the right people. It seems ineffective. Could also backfire and turn people away.
16.  This project, however exciting it it seems to be - is out of scope of this current fund theme.
17.  An island does not help to promote developement within 6 months.
18.  The proposal misses out on the agenda for the current Fund Challenge.
19.  The proposer has not mentioned relevant experience in founding micronations. Also, the 25m ada budget is more than Fund 2 can provide.
20.  this plan is crazy but I like it. But it is more likely to see visual Cardano space than Cardano physical nation in the future.
21.  The plan as the author suggests himself is a ""crazy idea"" full of nonsensical stuff. It's a fantasy (is)land with no auditability.
22.  The experience of the proposer in real-estate can help, but founding a micro-nation is a huge and risky task. The real-estate will most likely be the smallest challenge. The proposer also seems to count on Cardano Foundation's direct involvement. Required team-setup and expertise not described.
23.  Relevant but unsubstantiated experience. No examples of work provided. Budget appears high with no cost breakdown to justify.
24.  The idea brings some excitement to the Cardano community although the implementation is very difficult with the expectation of a decentralized ownership of the island by Cardano community
25.  Other than buying an island. It seems it would take a lot to build infrastructure, organize, sustain and manage it. How could one measure it's success over a short period ? The overall project could take decades, funds, work and commitment which might not be afterall worth it.
26.  As stated by Dor Garbash in the weekly Town Hall on 7/10/2020, proposals that exceed the budget will be automatically rejected, so there is no need for further evaluation.

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  The scope is too big now. Narrow the scope down to a reachable goal that can be achieved in 6 months.
2.  Really? I am fairly sure this is a joke application.
3.  I do not see experience or plan to even think that it is possible to implement it.
4.  The proposal is out of scope of Fund2 challenge, experience or plan doesn't matter.
5.  Cannot verify background experience, etc. Hence, unsure if this is feasible to see it through on that note alone.
6.  There is no specific plan. Only a loose statement of possibilities that would need to be researched further.
7.  it is very vague and the proposer does not spark a lot of trust.
8.  The proposal does not mention how it will achieve developer attraction.
9.  The proposal does not include a roadmap, milestones, credentials, and success metrics. The problem and solution described do not address the challenge.
10.  out of budget
11.  There's literally nothing presented (except wishful thinking) to assess feasibility, and impact to the community and as such the proposal is inadequate. To quote Vitalik, it's a dumpster fire.
12.  I found no action planning and/or roadmap that would fit into the frame of Fund 2, no milestone, no definition of success. I suggest to re-think this idea and/or make careful refinement and legal risk assessment. In my eyes this is a way too big (ad)venture for the very focused Fund 2.
13.  Insufficient information to assess the feasibility and impact of the proposal. No roadmap or milestones provided.
14.  There is sufficient information in my opinion to decide whether this idea should qualify for the grant or not and all points to the proposal being highly unqualified for the developer's attraction effectivity
15.  The proposal doesn't provide sufficient information because there are many variables and factors to put into consideration (location, price, legal framework, market demand…)
16.  As stated by Dor Garbash in the weekly Town Hall on 7/10/2020, proposals that exceed the budget will be automatically rejected, so there is no need for further evaluation.
17.  More funds than are available; off topic for Fund 2; no feasible plan.
18.  Insuficient information.
19.  The proposal is irrelevant to Fund2 Challenge.
20.  ""A lot of detail missing on how this can actually be achieved. Seems like a gross mis-allocation of resources. I fear - making a proposal for more than 1000% of the fund also isn't very confident inducing in author's ability to judge appropriately project's scope for this particular round.
21.  This could be considered only when the funding round was x times larger and under different scope. Me liking an idea is not enough to encourage voting for it. My apologies.""
22.  No budget and no plans for the actual governance of all the details when having a micronation.
23.  The proposal has no factual basis.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Right now, and for the forseeable future stakepool operators are the lifeblood of Cardano. Tools that bring them on board quicker and more effectively are vital for our ecosystem. Kyle is already well recognized in the community so there will be a great platform ready for each piece of content as it is delivered
2.  While this proposal is well thought out and necessary to maintain the security of the network, it fails to address the current challenge of bringing developers to the ecosystem.
3.  ""This proposal does address one key component of the (businesses on top of Cardano) in the next 6 months"""" project challenge. The fostering new Dapps component is less obvious.
4.  It does have an element that addresses future SPOs - """"Basic Linux for stake pool operators tutorial video"""". I like the fact that a team is backing the proposal and that it is an experienced group of SPOs, which is exactly the right match for a project of this type. ""
5.  Educational videos about stake pool operation content will be created. The proposal could sustantiate how improving the stake pool operator experience would encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
6.  This is a initiative indirectly addressing our current challenge in my opinion. It doesn't mean it isn't of value though. I see it's value to the wider layman community wanting to run a stake pool. As such it's value is tremendous. It may very well be that this idea's implementation might attract developers to the ecosystem..
7.  It isn't clear how this proposal is in line with the proposal of fund2. This proposal seeks to bring improvements to SPOs, but the purpose of fund2 is to attract developers and entrepreneurs, I think that creating a better environment and more educational material is interesting to bring more SPOs and qualify them, but SPOs would be in the group considered as developers? In my opinion, this is open to interpretation.
8.  ""I don't see enough effort in the proposal to determine what/how it fits within the scope of the dFund2 challenge:
9.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
10.  It is possible to deduct some synergies but it hasn't been made entirely clear the marriage of SPO directed information vs. Dapps developers specifically.""
11.  Very useful proposal but unrelated to the current challenge, should be proposed in a subsequent fund.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Seems mostly off topic for Fund 2, but bumping the score to 2/5 on the off chance that improving this space might prompt new SPOs to emerge… but given the current saturation of pools (relative to 'k'), it doesn't seem apparent to me that these are kind of businesses that Fund 2 is seeking to encourage.
2.  SPOCRA is a relatively new but has many experienced people. One thing that the proposal fails to address how/who will control the funds after distribution.
3.  The right people are making this proposal - The Stake Pool Operators Collective Representation Assembly. This is an absolutely perfect match and maybe the strongest guarantee that it will be implemented successfully. The SPOCRA team is unlikely to be satisfied with poor implementation as they have skin in the game, in the form of the reputation of their respective stake pools.
4.  The proposer is a stake pool operator with Cardano videos on their own YouTube channel. The proposer has also submitted another proposal to develop an Arduino library for signing Cardano transactions.
5.  The successful implementation of this is of no doubt at this well known community member has already proven record with this precise topic..
6.  ""SPOCRA is made up of experienced SPOs and with different skillsets, I consider them extremely capable to execute the proposal given the fact that they have been operating their pools for several months successfully.
7.  There is a detailed plan, with clear goals and detailed budget allocation.""
8.  ""I have every confidence that this proposal can and will be made good for. Given the track record of individuals involved.
9.  However, it would be dependent on how the SPOCRA board agrees or not on the steps ahead. ""
10.  The members of SPOCRA are highly skilled individuals and have very good incentive since they are themselves SPO.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  The plan does seem feasible however.
2.  In most cases, I would prefer clear metrics for ROI, but this is just one of those bread and butter parts of any platform that are essential for success. This is an SPO playbook which will definitely help bring more SPOs in and help them operate successfully
3.  This proposal is without a doubt feasible but does not address the challenge directly.
4.  It provides a specific timetable and the funding / financing aspect is well fleshed out - with specific deliverables that are linked to financing components. What may be at issue is how to measure the quality of the output that is provided.
5.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, and credentials.
6.  The successful implementation of this is of no question. Based on our current challenge though it is up top the voter to consider whether this has a lot of potential to attract new developers to Cardano. If the answer is Yes then you need to consider this. Should we ask does this meet our FUND2 challenge criteria then the answer will be in my opinion at the best indirectly..
7.  ""As I mentioned in the first point, I think the alignment of the proposal with the objective of fund2 is interpretative, as some may consider that the arrival of new SPOs meets the requirement for new developers at Cardano.I do not agree. There is no urgency to attract SPOs in the coming months, as there are more than 1000 pools today and blockchains parameters currently do not encourage the entry of new SPOs.
8.  There is a clear definition of the objective and goals to be observed by the community, this allows us to monitor the development of the project.""
9.  Proposal has a good level of depth - the only unclear element is how these funds will be dispersed and to whom. Which creates few question marks around missing element of allocation.
10.  This proposal doesn't mention the current challenge.
11.  Whilst the plan is feasible, it is off topic for Fund 2.

**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  While this proposal would promote Cardano overall, it does not target developers.
2.  Sponsorship of solar power plants does not address the challenge of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
3.  Not related to fund2 challenge
4.  ""The proposal addresses a bigger picture with energy transition where major energy players and government bodies are decision-makers. Approach to such bodies is extremely limited and no info is shown that there is actual access to relevant persons to even present the idea.
5.  It is not clear where Cardano will be actually utilized or how the work will be done on Cardano.
6.  Other specialized energy cryptocurrencies such as Energy Web Token have a business model of sale of electricity through the blockchain which might be a model for Cardano. However, the process is not described in the proposal and is a substantial endeavour.
7.  To conclude, the broad scope with no clear application area is out of limited scope and goals of Fund 2.""
8.  While good in concept, proposal doesn't touch on state and industry regulation and implication
9.  An interesting proposal but it does not address the challenge posed by Fund2. Requires substantially more planning and development with an effective monetary strategy.
10.  I strongly disagree with this idea being proposed as a means to incentivize developer influx to the Cardano platform. This idea uses buzzwords as a means to attract voters and would only result in enrichment of the proposer having no benefit to the wider Cardano ecosystem as it is.. The current chalenge is not addressed by this idea at all hence 1 star only
11.  As stated by Dor Garbash in the weekly Town Hall on 7/10/2020, proposals that exceed the budget will be automatically rejected. This proposal exceeds the budget by 500 000 ADAs, so there is no need for further evaluation.
12.  Very off topic for Fund 2. Consider later funding rounds.
13.  I believe in the use of renewable energy and the support of such projects. But the proposal lacks development. For this I must say that it does not address the need for fund2
14.  The proposal is not in scope of Fund2 challenge, or even Cardano.
15.  It fails to address clearly and plainly how it meets the scope of the challenge.

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  There is no plan to bring developers on board.
2.  The proposal could spark development on Cardano, but there is no clear direction evident.
3.  Proposal advocate clearly states which individuals will be attracted to bring this idea to reality, but does not specify their role and what tasks they will carry out. Furthermore, there is a lack of explanation on how will Cardano be able to promote solar energy and what role the community will play.
4.  The proposer did not cite relevant experience delivering ROI for sponsors. It is unclear whether the funds are for an individual or an organization. The proposal does not substantiate the Cardano promotion plan.
5.  seems to me, the proposal is about building a business on Cardano.
6.  ""Dealing with national energy providers and government bodies requires an established company with references in such work.
7.  From the provided info, the proposer has some experience in the energy field but no experience in the application of blockchain in the energy field.
8.  In addition, the blockchain is a small part of the whole energy solution and therefore dependent on major investments in particular energy storage provider (Tesla).
9.  From the provided information, it is either a one person or a small startup to tackle a big challenge in the conservative industry. ""
10.  No methodology for implementation given.
11.  Lacks evidence of experience and work examples. No development plan provided and an unsubstantiated budget.
12.  It is at all feasible to implement this idea, only it would be to no benefit to the Cardano ecosystem hence it should not qualify for the grant
13.  As stated by Dor Garbash in the weekly Town Hall on 7/10/2020, proposals that exceed the budget will be automatically rejected. This proposal exceeds the budget by 500 000 ADAs, so there is no need for further evaluation.
14.  This is no particularly articulate plan here at all.
15.  No experience in the area and no detailed plan is presented. For this reason I cannot say that it would be implemented successfully or not.
16.  The proposal is not in scope of Fund2 challenge, experience and plan are not detailed to assess.
17.  There is no reference that can be verified for the proposal to understand background, etc.
18.  There is no budget, no actual business plan, just loose ideas.
19.  No it does not seem to be likely, because there is no clear roadmap
20.  The proposal lacks a timeline, roadmap, clarity on how it addresses the Fund2 Challenge. Enough information to conclude how relevant it is to the objective of the current challenge.
21.  The proposal does not include a roadmap, milestones, deliverables, and credentials. The problem and solution described do not address the challenge.
22.  out of budget.
23.  ""The proposal requires a substantial amount of ADA, 2.5 mil, but without any breakdown of costs, tasks, implementation targets, KPIs or any measurable and quantifiable data.
24.  There is no timeframe, sample projects, similar projects, pilot studies or even market research of actual interest in such development in Central America.
25.  Overall, there is a lack of substance and planning for an ambitious and expensive project.""

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  Good in concept, lacking in avenue of implementation.
2.  Insufficient information to assess the feasibility and impact of the proposal.
3.  The impact of this idea's implementation would be enrichment of the proposer and no new developers would find their way to the Cardano ecosystem..As it does not address the chalenge nor it would impact the ecosystem the idea is not qualifying for the grant in my opinion..
4.  As stated by Dor Garbash in the weekly Town Hall on 7/10/2020, proposals that exceed the budget will be automatically rejected. This proposal exceeds the budget by 500 000 ADAs, so there is no need for further evaluation.
5.  Feasibility of asking for more funds than are available… obvious first problem. Also no plan, also very off topic for Fund 2.
6.  ""
7.  In every sense the information is scarce. What makes decision making difficult. For example, there is a lack of structure on how the requested money will be invested. Or how to measure how many developers and entrepreneurs were attracted.
8.  ""
9.  The proposal is not in scope of Fund2 challenge.
10.  ""Project itself is missing meaningful and measurable input in order to be taken seriously at this point.
11.  I can appreciate the thought - but it isn't within the scope of the project theme either. ""
12.  There is no budget, no actual business plan, just loose ideas.
13.  there are almost no information, except two names

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

Creating a message signing standard is something that is necessary for the future of Cardano and will allow developers to better leverage the Cardano network.

I do agree that the proposal does clearly address the challenge segment ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"" It might be less obvious to see how this will benefit Dapp development, although it is still early days to envisage the scope and needs of a ""future killer Dapp"" that will come to rule the Cardano platform. Anyhow, the proposal clearly adds a new layer of usefulness - by offering a foreseeable path for users to ""prove things like ownership of ADA"", which evidently is a new tool that Dapp builders can tinker with.

According to Sebastiens reputation the job will be no issue. Funds requested is also very low.

I'm not quite sure how does this proposal addresses the Fund2 challenge but considering its utility, impact to Cardano members/users/SPOs, as well as the funds requested I think this proposal should be funded this round.

By far one of the most clear proposals in fund2 that I read so far. Using Rust libraries allows any dev to make use of it to add message signing in their apps.

The message signing standard CIP will be implemented in Yoroi so that it can prove reserves, identity, and more.

Useful project finding wide support in the community proposed by community's own proven actor. Addressed the challenge entirely!!

It opens up new possibilities for the developers to use in a plug-and-play fashion.

""Proposal does not appropriately make an effort to answer the question of dFund2:

""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""

I think I can see where this is headed but it is not immediately clear. I think it would be useful if this was addressed in a simple one paragraph. ""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

This add more usage possibilities and thus future opportunities.

Hard to say that this feature would draw in developers… but it is basic, cheap and might be the small feature that someone is looking for as part of their use case.

Maybe not the most accurate to the challenge topic, but absolutely good improvement for very little cost.

Emurgo has a proven track record and there's no doubt that they will be able to complete this proposal in a timely manner.

100% success guaganteed

Sebastien is a well knows memeber of Cardano community, he's doing some amazing work at Emurgo and privately. I think with his track record it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully.

The library is basically there with adjustments needed for (post) Shelley. Seb is a legend in Cardano community and one of the most respected team members from any Cardano entity. Timeline is clear and budget is maybe a bit low of what you would expect if someone else was making a proposal.

The proposer is an Emurgo developer.

As per Sebastien's prominent engagement in the Cardano ecosystem and proven results with e.g. Yoroi there is no doubt this will be done to a high standard.

Excellent track record.

""Given the author's experience and background, there is very little doubt that this plan would not be implemented successfully.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

Given the experience and reputation of the proposer there is little doubt to be had.

Emurgo has got sufficient street cred in this community. It would have been nice to see a better writeup from them though… particularly if they are trading on that street cred.

Everyone knows Sebastian. The fact that he propose it gave us 100% certainty that it will be done. Only 5k ADA

Short and sweet, though clearly significant time and thought already went into this. The amount of ADA seems too small to really make an impact unless just a little integration and testing are needed to bring this into Yoroi. Seems like fairly high ROI which will encourage more experimentation and possibly even open up the opportunity for a Cardano patreon system in time. Patreon for Cardano would be huge and this seems like a first step towards that

The information provided along with the github repo proves its feasibility. As for as the challenge, it is something that would expand the capabilities of what a developer can do with Cardano.

""The roadmap is clear, the milestones are defined succinctly, with precision.

What is missing, in my view, is some kind of timetable that is linked to specific points in time and there is some haziness about whether the proposed solution for this issue is """"THE"""" solution that the Cardano ecosystem needs. Is this an issue /problem that IOHK and The Cardano Foundation also identified as necessary? Not sure. In this stage of the project, this seems to be an issue that would have been pinpointed by IOHK as something that is necessary or not, so some supporting documentation would be welcome. For example, as the IOHK Prism project is referenced, did IOHK itself raise this issue as something that is desirable - but is on the backburner or they do not have the resources to complete. Maybe it is going to be addressed by IOHK, not clear from the proposal. ""

It will make the system more save and include another plus to the system again

Documentation and explanations are detailed enough to convince me about this project feasibility.

Clear overview of possible use cases, support for Desktop, mobile and web browser as well as Yoroi wallets makes it a no brainer that this will help devs when developing Dapps…

The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, deliverables, credentials, and use cases.

Very reasonable project with a reasonable budget and proven capability of it's proposer, strong candidate for the funds requested !!

Extensive description of the plan and concept.

""The document provided is very clear in terms of how it wishes to achieve its objectives.

The only question remains - fund are used to pay for developer's time to make this happen? I am guessing - because proposal does not address budget requirements beyond declared value.""

More explanation for non technical or dev people in the main description of the proposal would have been very useful for the voters.

Well specified and cheap to progress; small utility expansion of Cardano for developers to leverage.

Specification and libriaries are already done. Detailed informations given and clear goal.

1.  Proposal's main goal is to hire 1 developer in order to accelerate the development of an existing service. Does not seek to reach out wide developer community.
2.  Funding Cardano development at Quid.li is one way of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
3.  ""The proposal introduces Cardano to an existing business model aside other cryptocurrencies.
4.  It demonstrates how companies can use Cardano as an award/payment for the employees, enabling easier access to crypto.
5.  This business model is already in place, working and will add Cardano, therefore increasing its use in the business environment. However, it will not build on Cardano which is one of the goals for Fund 2. ""
6.  Having a 3rd party act as an umbrella outlet for simple crypto transactions, rather than educating, invites corruption.
7.  ""This doesn't look like anything related to the challenge for Fund 2.
8.  It might be better to try again in later funding rounds if the 'theme' is looking for interesting utility cases for Cardano.""
9.  This proposal (fund) is to integrate Cardano to existing business Quidli, which doesn't align with Fund2 challenge.
10.  ""I struggle to see the wider adoption of this element beyond the Quidli product. From what it seems - we will be able to fund one developer for this challenge to take place.
11.  Would it be great to understand in greater detail how this project meets the actual challenge theme a bit more.
12.  It is great idea - just slightly off the scope beyond initial single company use case.""
13.  Weak plan for developer adoption within 6 months. The is no (or low) actual marketing or outreach.

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  the proposal, could confront developers with Cardano in the far future. But in the short term this product is probably too niche
2.  Proposal's service may be competing with current IOHK model to reward developers for submitting and executing proposals. Clearly outlined expenses, but no timeline presented.
3.  The proposer has launched Quid.li with support for BTC, ETH, and DAI currencies. They propose hiring a developer to add ADA support by the end of the year. The cost is completely borne by the budget requested.
4.  ""The proposal is done by a company which is already active and running the same model with other cryptocurrencies.
5.  Given the right competences of the developer to be hired with the approved funds, there is a high chance that the proposal will be implemented. There is however no mention of the availability of such hire on the market or the likelihood of fast onboarding. If there is no hire, implementation is still possible with the current team at a slower pace.
6.  Cost breakdown seems reasonable and in line with the cost levels in France.""
7.  Giving them funding will not affect whether they ""implement"" Cardano into their scheme, lest it be a bribe.
8.  There is very little 'plan' presented here at all, but it doesn't seem unrealistic to achieve this goal for that funding.
9.  The proposer (team) already has a running business with other cryptocurrency integrated to it. But, proposal is not fit for fund2 challenge.
10.  ""I like the general sentiment behind the project itself. What I struggle is though - they have already onboarded so many wallets over the past year.
11.  We have witnessed this past Shelley change how resource less these platforms become when you make an upgrade, etc.
12.  I would have loved to learn how Cardano will be given enough priority attention to ensure that front end experience is seamless. And we don't get hundreds of requests asking why is their wallet not functional, ADA locked, etc. ""
13.  Prior work on very similar projects (btc, eth) should enable them to easily implement the proposal.
14.  the proposers seem competent and the proposal is not too ambitious.
15.  Sufficient information presented along with fiscal costs in order to assess relativity to the current fund challenge. The proposal misses out on the key agenda.
16.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, and credentials. Potential clients that would use Quid.li to manage ada would help assess whether the project was implemented successfully. Business growth and development expansion projections would be useful for impact assessment.
17.  ""The proposal addresses the weakness of ETH and high gas fees, therefore the need for a better crypto solution. Cardano fits this role perfectly.

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  Significant information is lacking and it is off topic for Fund 2 anyway.
2.  The proposal has clear plan and provided sufficient material to assess feasibility and impact.
3.  ""No benchmarking metrics have been drafted that would enable us to understand where this project is headed and what the exact aspirations are.
4.  Some key metrics are given such as a number of active wallets, but not the current number of users or any future projections.
5.  Implementation might be successful, but the possible or estimated impact for Cardano is not evident from the presented data.
6.  To conclude, the proposal is feasible but it is not possible to fully determine the effect or future impact of the implementation.""
7.  ""Doesn't propose challenge or solution.
8.  Giving them funding seems silly.""What is the impact of your proposal after the subsidy has been used up? Will you be able to retain the developer you hired?
9.  How can we measure down the line if these funds have had desirable affect or not? That's a must to be able to allow yourself being accountable. ""
10.  Very lacking in information. No budget and no projections for developer adoption.
11.  More information about fund allocation en plan/road-map are missing. Feasibility can not be extrapolated from proposal.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

This proposal looks to me as to bring their pool to the world. With the rewards gained from staking they will do advertisements to bring Customers to Cardano

A marketing campaign is proposed, and would be funded by the N45B stake pool margin. The proposal could be seeking a mandate from the general community, or promoting the stake pool on Project Catalyst.

This is a lovely self funding idea using this platform just for awareness purpose, no funds requested ;-)

This proposal is not asking for a budget, so it makes no sense to continue the evaluation since the realization of the project doesn't depend on the treasury.

This is not the type of marketing Cardano needs to attract more devs and entrepreneurs.

""Proposal does not make appropriate effort to bridge the gap between its proposal and dFund2 theme:

""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""

Off topic for Fund 2.

Will market Cardano towards the relevant businesses

The proposal is just an idea; there is no plan. It does not request any funding.

The proposer wants to make us aware of his initiative which is self funded, no treasury funds requested.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

This proposal is not asking for a budget, so it makes no sense to continue the evaluation since the realization of the project doesn't depend on the treasury.

There are not enough details in the proposal to assess this statement properly.

Unable to verify credentials beyond stake pool website. It is hard to establish accountability - but then - there are no funds requested. So this reads more like an advert instead. Unsure about the actual goal/motivation.

""I cant even tell what this is from the writeup. Seems like an advertisement for an SPO… who intends to do Cardano marketing from pool fees?

No funds have been requested.""

No clear implementation plan

They show 3 professional websites with a content that is in line with the proposal. I am n sure how the Carnado Ecosystem will benefit from this proposal to make it grow. Additional explanation might be required

The proposal is just an idea; there is no plan.

No funds requested, this is a self funding idea making us aware if its existence. Consider delegating to this pool should you want to support this ;-)

1.  Bridges to options drive use
2.  An ERC-\* converter would encourage non-technical users to migrate existing tokens to Cardano. It will be made available as part of the Tatum solution suite. The proposal does not address why users would use the Tatum converter instead of the converter being built by IOG. Tatum does not have any visible traction, based on the GitHub repository and the official website. It also depends on smart contracts, which are currently unavailable. It seems unlikely that such a converter would encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
3.  The (very) positive thing about this proposal is that it can attract developers wanting to learn more about blockchain(s) without any previous blockchain experience. It clearly addresses the challenge to attract more devs to build on top of the blockchain.
4.  Seamless integration of smart contracts migrating to Cardano are vital not only to the Cardano ecosystem, but to the ecosystem of a migrating token.
5.  ""Creating a solution to convert native Ethereum tokens has the potential to bring many Ethereum projects as it should facilitate the transition of these projects, making the onboarding process easier and faster.
6.  However, it is not clear whether this proposal is redundant or not, as IOHK seems to be already developing a project to solve this problem. Some people questioned this and there was no clear answer on the subject. It makes no sense to finance this project if IOHK is already solving the problem.""
7.  Definitely targeting developers for existing blockchain projects and lowering the barrier to entry to the Cardano ecosystem
8.  As IOHK has already commissioned renewal of KEVM etc. to the benefit of everyone in the Cardano ecosystem for no additional cost to the treasury there is no need to spend further community funds on the development of some kind solidity to plutus converter. Such a project is very useful indeed but already paid for by Charles.
9.  Noting that the plan is to build tooling which will appeal to an existing community of blockchain oriented developers using a middleware solution… it is extremely hard to dispute that this would not attract developers within 6 months if successful.
10.  ""This has a good potential to bring gaps in - but the proposal does not address the elephant in the room - other entities working on the ERC converters - nor how this is different vis a vis comparison to these.
11.  I love the idea of converter but I don't know how big of a chance it stands if IOG rolls out theirs. I would have loved to see some differentiation so have a clear understanding why THIS and not opting to wait for IOG. ""
12.  A ERC-\* converter creates a lot of development in the Cardano ecosystem. But if I am not mistaking there is already one being build by IOG. It could be very confusing if you have two converters. I dont know if a collaboration could work.
13.  ""Confused to why this is proposed, when IOG is working on an ERC-converter already. Are there differences and if yes, what are they ?
14.  Maybe the same work shouldn't be done twice.""
15.  Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully
16.  Very well organized
17.  The proposer is a developer that has developed the Tatum solution suite. Smart contracts are required to implement the converter. The 260k ada budget is a huge budget for a single implementer. It is unclear how the tasks are different e.g. e.g. ""Add Cardano to the Tatum Platform"" and ""Add to the Tatum Platform API"".
18.  Clearly the Tatum team is experienced and so is the Cardanians team. Going to their website and reading about their projects tells you all you need that the there's a high grade to success.
19.  Proposal seems to have a clear plan of action and seeks to tackle an essential task.
20.  ""The team seems to have enough experience to develop the project, as it is a company with a few years of existence creating integration and support for several blockchains.
21.  There is a good deal of detail about budget allocation and execution time, but the fact that IOHK is already developing a solution to the problem makes the planning and allocation of fund2 for this project redundant.""
22.  Git repro shows you have an existing base to work from which is good, but after 4 years i would hope for more contributors and community engagement. My concern is even if you implement a converter successfully, who is actively using tatem
23.  It is unlikely that the completion of this project will bring additional benefit to the Cardano ecosystem or potential developer. The ability of proposer to implement this is of little importance then.
24.  ""The plan does seem rational and well priced… but not documented particularly well.
25.  You could improve with some links to real world credentials and/or expand on the team composition and skills.""
26.  ""I am unsure about the relationship between Tatum company and Cardanians. One major question remains in my mind - why isn't Tatum group able to make proposal directly but it goes via proxy?
27.  Now, I don't have any issue still being endorsed by Cardanians but it would seem more credible if they would be asking for funds directly with endorsement instead. ""
28.  I really like the information that you bring to the table. From budgeting to the Git it looks like you guys know what your doing.
29.  Not enough information on the submitter of the proposal or the team. Tatum.io doesn't seem to work for me.
30.  Proposal neglects to distinguish itself from what is currently being implemented by IOG.
31.  The proposal would benefit from credentials outside of Tatum, which does not have any visible traction. Existing tokens that would use the converter when implemented would help assess whether the project was implemented successfully. Tatum platform usage metrics would be useful for impact assessment.
32.  Clear breakdown, clear timeline although the timeline might be too optimistic (only 75 days to complete all this). However, one big thing to discuss is that Charles mentioned in his AMAs that he already contacted an external company to make a converter tool. TBC if there's no overlap and if we should 2 similar projects but otherwise this project seems very promising.
33.  Although I lack full technical understanding, the approach is based upon a preexisting technology and should be successful.
34.  The project has an objective timeline. The definition of success is clear, because if the project complies with the established, it will be easy to verify the use of the service by developers who wanted to migrate ERC \* tokens to Cardano.
35.  The cost breakdown is light on details, links to a detailed task breakdown and marketing plan should be added to the repo for accountability. My bigger concern is even if you implement the converter successfully, who is actively using tatem and how effective has it been for other coins already onboarded to grow developer and an entrepreneur base?
36.  Based on the information provided it seems there is no need to spend additional treasury funds to commission this as it is already paid for by IOHK. No evidence was provided of benefit added on top of IOHK's commissioned effort..

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  Documentation is not as detailed as I would like, but I can enough there to suggest the team are competent technologists and understand the blockchain developer space.
2.  ""The proposal doesn't differentiate what the funds split is between the two platforms and who will be responsible for which part.
3.  What is responsibility of Cardanians and their role in the proposal.
4.  What is the responsibility of Tatum group and what their reference to the project will be exactly.
5.  It's too hazy at the moment to understand who and how we can benchmark the effort. I picture this is rather an easy step to sweep up. ""
6.  Again it is a great plan and you know what your doing. The only concern I have is that there two of the same projects being done right now.
7.  More information could be provided to assess the feasibility and relevance of the proposal. Namely what is the difference with IOG's ERC-converter ? How many people would specifically work on this project (1 person or a team) ? Regular updates in what form ?

The proposers look like an experienced dev team. There don't appear to be significant reasons to assume they could not deliver this solution.

The roadmap is concise

04/Nov/20 6:36 PM,324303,1857,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  A survey to understand what blockchain developers love/hate about their ecosystem is proposed to identify the right set of incentives to encourage developers to build on Cardano. A report will be published, which would better inform other Project Catalyst projects in encouraging developers to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
2.  This is a plan for a plan to attract developers. This plan in it of itself will only gather the information necessary to determine what it will take to incentivize devs to come to Cardano, but there will need to be a follow on plan in a future funding round most likely to implement a marketing plan based off of that information. To me this is a low cost (12,500 ADA) data gathering exercise that would be valuable in the months ahead
3.  ""Organizational and Individual Psychology are imperative to understanding large-scale projects of this nature.
4.  We should access what potential migrators value.
5.  However, I would remind you there's a thin line between surveys and spam, and I would request that this be implemented with as much decorum as possible.""
6.  The proposal doesn't directly address the Fund2 challenge, the project gives assessment of potential entrepreneurs/developers to Cardano.
7.  I did not expect to give this five stars when I saw the project title, however this is a great project for mining thick data on developers. For a small amount of effort a very rich data set will be gleaned that will serve the cardano project quite well for future engagement efforts with developers.
8.  The results from this type of research would have been invaluable to all proposals at the onset of Fund 2. In itself, I don't see the project encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano aside from building awareness in the market place. I do feel the research if conducted with actionable results could pave the way for more focused proposals from the community in the future.
9.  ""Finding the driving motivators of Dapp builders to use that information for future marketing or adjustments to how Cardano is communicated fully addresses the challenge.
10.  It could have probably been added that the interviews themselves could already have the effect of attracting interviewed parties to Cardano.""
11.  A great to proposal to understand and research what developers would evaluate in the ecosystem.
12.  I agree that successful survey of ""developer's feelings"" does bring value to the potential new developer as developers can than build solutions for the needs expressed :D
13.  ""This goes in line with my understanding that in order to create a meaningful impact - you need appropriately sized sample.
14.  I cannot figure out how are we going to eliminate biases. In fact, we may be approaching it backwards somewhat.
15.  """"I believe the best way to understand what the feelings of blockchain entrepreneurs and developers are is to directly ask them.""""
16.  Is this based on an actual research or is it just a gut feeling, experience? Would be great to understand why this way is the best way to move forward. Conveying this understanding would make me feel more comfortable understanding if this effort will be efficient or not. ""
17.  This proposal is a direct approach to the challenge of fund2. Formalized research can empower our community to improve its approach to solving the challenge present in fund2.
18.  ""Direct contact with Developers is certainly a great idea. Depending on the message conveyed during tis cold call, and responses received, it could certainly attract devs to the Cardano Platform.
19.  The proposal has not defined the total number expected to be attracted.""

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  The proposal offers to do a deep study of preferences and aversions of developers currently existing within the blockchain industry in order to better understand their needs and how to better cater to them. This has the potential to separate Cardano from other players who simply rely on their marketing team to attract the talent, which in turn can create a problem where developers migrate to a project only to discover their expectations are not met with reality.
2.  The proposal does address the challenge in a generalized kind of way, although I do not feel that the proposal addresses Cardano specifically. There are many people flirting with the idea of building on blockchain and a general approach to survey a sample of all of them may not be relevant to our ecosystem. A more narrowly focused research with more specific goals in mind that relate directly to Cardano may be better with clearer deliverables that can encourage developers and businesses to build on Cardano.
3.  I question the effectiveness of this idea, but it certainly appears to be a genuine effort to address the Fund 2 goals.
4.  The proposer has relevant market research education and work experience. The plan and budget are sensible for the proposed project.
5.  Proposer has MBA thesis in market research, surveys and interviews and has worked in market research with a focus on start ups in the past so likelihood of quality execution is high.
6.  Proposer has a clear methodology of implementation and relevant experience.
7.  Reading the proposal and provided link I assess that the proposer is capable and have the experience required to complete the project in the said duration. Budget seems to be fair.
8.  This proposal accurately identifies the risk of low response rate. Given that this sounds like a solo effort that could undermine the results. That said this still seems like a valuable undertaking and is well worth the risk. I would encourage the proposal originator to leverage The catalyst community and the broader cardano community and developers as they will have direct contact with blockchain developers across the various blockchain projects. This should ensure a higher level of engagement. Probably the richest source of data would be developers that members in the cardano community know that do not want to work on cardano what are their reasons why are they avoiding the Cardano project? Knowing both what the developers value in blockchain development and knowing potential barriers of entry into cardano both are extremely valuable.
9.  Given Borja's experience, I am confident he has the skills necessary to successfully implement his proposal. Funds requested are reasonable and the plan looks actionable.
10.  ""As stated in the proposal itself, the highest risk seems, that the targeted 200 contacts can't be reached and/or that not enough responses can be gathered.
11.  Another risk might be that the tight timeline of 4-5 weeks can't be achieved due to slow response rates from the contacts.
12.  Given that the requested funds primarily have to cover the salary for the project coming out at about 5$/hr, the self paid out salary lies significantly above average for Myanmar region. A cost breakdown including hourly rate and comparison to local rates plus additional costs through expenses would help clarify the requested amount.""
13.  Experience in Research Methods is the key of this proposal's success. Adding prior work samples and mostly relevant to development could have given 1-2 star more.
14.  The scope of this as presented is absolutely implementable within the estimated timeline and I don't doubt a successful implementation based on the approach specified.
15.  Judging based on the outline - and reviewing the background of the proposal author - it is very likely that person is competent to carry out scope of the proposal outlined in this project.
16.  ""The proposer seems extremely qualified in relation to the experience needed for this proposal, he provided a link to his Linkedin and showed to have professional experience with research, in addition he has a related MBA in the field of market research.
17.  There is well-defined planning divided into stages and a relatively low budget definition. There is no need for further details on budget allocation, since the nature of the project depends basically on the proposer's working tim.""
18.  ""The education and language skills claimed by the proposer sure suggests knowledge in this area. Cold calling developers may be more difficult than other sorts of research projects though.
19.  Can the proposer provide information that would help the reviewer and voter understand the talent and strengths in speaking with developers that have been successfully accomplished in the past? The timeline and deliverable list does not seem complete, and it is hard to see what success metrics are being measured.""
20.  The proposer claims to have experience conducting research and surveys, along with their relatively low ADA request, this has the potential to bring great benefit to Cardano ecosystem for low cost.
21.  Yes, the plan seems deliverable, although its success may be hampered by the poor quality of results - that may be the outcome of this rather random, general approach to ""developers""
22.  It seems probable that a database of people can be built and several of those people can be interviewed. I am not so certain that the outcome will result in an influx of devs and/entrepreneurs onto Cardano.
23.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, and credentials. A list of potential interview candidates and questions would be useful for feasibility assessment.
24.  More details needed on the methods
25.  User highlights week by week expectations for the project, allowing for a 1 week extension should their be lower response rate from devs than anticipated. Feasibility/practicality is overall high. My one question would be what are the plans to use this research in the real world after its collated to attract more developers.
26.  To assume that everyone is only motivated by money severely discounts humanity. There may be smart contract holders that are unaware of the electrical efficiency of Cardano and would be motivated by ecological impact, etc.

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  ""The proposal provides clear roadmap and milestones. Provides sufficient material to assess feasibility and impact.
2.  ""
3.  Clear roadmap and milestones provided with a final report expected at the end of the project. The results and solutions proposed could be finely adjusted to provide more focus. Also grouping / targeting interview to niches could provide some additional insight.
4.  ""Detailed scope and roadmap with timeline given including milestones.
5.  Success criteria is not completely clear, assumed to be 25% feedback rate on second loop survey.
6.  The breakdown into weeks significantly improves auditability.""
7.  Detailed weekly plan with goal and added value.
8.  This is a proposal that somehow addresses FUND2 challenge, it is feasible and of a little cost to the treasury. Voter needs to weigh potential impact against the cost and let their Ada speak for themselves..
9.  ""I am not convinced there is a sufficient methodology in place that would support meaningful output that can be applied generally.
10.  Different seniority level developers will likely have varying different needs.
11.  Shooting for a sample of 20 correspondents only doesn't persuade me that we can lean onto these findings on a great level. ""
12.  There is clarity in the definition of success, as the result of the project will be materialized in a document. Roadmap and goals have been well defined and can be easily assessed by the community.
13.  There are few details provided about how the 200 names will be acquired. Is a sample of 50 random developers significant given the total size of developers out there? This proposal if done well, may provide insights concerning the best way to attract them. What experience does the proposer have in applying the findings of interviews to a marketing plan?
14.  Clearly defined timeline and budget breakdowns along with clearly presented proposal's statement which aligns with Fund2 Challenge.
15.  I do not agree that there it is enough information on its feasibility (from the aspect of providing REAL value to the Cardano ecosystem) and that it will address the challenge effectively. It may be done, it may be completed but it does not mean that the ecosystem will benefit from this research.
16.  Uncertain feasibility and uncertain impact. The saving grace is it is cheap.

""The proposer reported having 15 years of experience in the sales and marketing sectors. I don't see how this experience can contribute to the execution of the project, since the idea of the project is to create solutions for monitoring and tracking medical devices and the proposer did not mention the need to hire anyone else in his proposal.

No prior experience in working with product development, IT or blockchain. Furthermore, the is no clear business plan.

Not able to determine/establish credibility of the project proposal owners vis-a-vis experience. Thus, not knowing where to start.

There is no plan here, just an idea.

funding i think will be a problem this this round

I've been working in the medical device industry for 10 years and this is a good thought and something absolutely needed. However, need to expand on this idea and show the users the problem and how it's symptoms cause great problems and that this solution will provide a fix for this and what benefits there will be from it. I've had similar ideas as well as even some additional thoughts on how many problems currently faced by companies could be solved in a decentralized way.

The proposal is just an idea; there is no plan.

There isn't enough information to assess the impact and feasibility of this project in relation to the fund2 proposal. The need for the budget has not been explained, nor how it will be allocated.

In response to having multiple projects submitted, my team is currently part time. If I receive funding for more than one project I have the scope to pick up the additional work by employing the staff on a full time basis. This both fits the requirements of getting more developers into Cardano and achieves my goal of building a full time Cardano software company. Over time my company will grow and we will take on more developers. The goal of the fund is to bring on more developers which I believe all my proposals aim to achieve that",NO

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

One of the issues of Cardano which have not evolved at the moment is PR. Emurgo and IOG spend their time on development and Videos for the community. McCann have not shown a lot at the moment, at least not notable. These short videos could spread the message further and faster at low costs

Short inspirational videos that are targeted at developers will be published every 2 weeks. The format is refreshingly different from the other content creation proposals.

The proposal directly markets Cardano on YouTube to new users.

The videos are not directly targeted at developers, but could bring a more general awareness of the Cardano strength, which could also hit developers here and there.

""The idea of having short videos (clips) and objectives is an interesting way to attract attention and ensure more direct and objective communication.

Given that the idea of the project is to attract developers and entrepreneurs through visibility, I think that a large part of the work is in promoting these videos to the greatest possible extent, but this was not mentioned in the proposal and the impact of this project on fund2 depends on it.""

This is not the type of marketing Cardano needs to attract more devs and entrepreneurs.

Off topic for Fund 2. It is possible that new Cardano devs and entrepreneurs may stumble in via this route though.

""I appreciate the proposed work very much. Love the content.

Thus, I am a bit surprised that proposal doesn't make an explicit connection with the dFund2 theme:

""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""

I can see how this can inspire/encourage someone but it should be clearly stated the form in the proposal. And I am missing that presently.""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

Very professional videos to present his own stakepool were presented, so success seems evitable

The proposer has generated value for the Cardano community with their short inspirational YouTube videos. The budget would allow the proposer to use proper stock video footage.

The proposer already created 6 videos and uploaded them to his YouTube channel. Videos have between 400 and 1200 views (at the time of writing this).

Lots of prior work and examples of exactly the product that is proposed.

""The proposer has experience with video editing and has placed a link to his channel where it is possible to check the content he has already produced about Cardano.

The proposer is requesting 70,000 ADAs to produce 30 minutes of clips and although I like this content model I think there is a great risk that these videos will not reach many people, as there is no description in the proposal of how these videos will be disseminated.""

The proposer claims to have the required experience. You can see that on their youtube channel.

The sample videos already provided look fantastic. No reason to believe that wouldn't continue.

""I have every confidence that based on the work presented that this proposal would be implemented.

I would have liked to see a bit more presentation on the person behind the proposal beyond stake pool presentation (which can be actually a distraction in the proposal).""

Short videos will likely spread faster over the globe than intensified conferences or blogs telling information that half the world don't understand. It is feasable and useful

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

The proposal includes a cost breakdown. The proposer has been very responsive on Ideascale and YouTube.

""New clip every two weeks"" is a very precise metric that can be easily audited. The proposer is an experienced video editor, no reason to doubt the feasibility.

There is a very clear cost breakdown, but now projection of the actual effect of having these videos made.

""There is no detail on how the project will impact fund2, because in the case of this proposal the impact depends on the reach of these videos and it wasn't detailed how this content will be disseminated.

A clear indication of success (such as counting views, likes, comments, etc …) of the project wasn't given, making it difficult for the community to assess whether the project succeeded or not.""

There are no milestones, metrics or KPIs present in the proposal

Certainly feasible. Just off topic for Fund 2.

""I like the clarity of pricing structure, costs associated etc.

However, I don't see enough effort put into benchmarking the results of this proposal. How are we going to measure if these videos have desirable impact - what are the goals specifically etc. Otherwise, we don't know how to grade these retroactively if it had a desirable effect or not.""

These are all things that need to happen before you submit a proposal.
30.  The second part of the question is how effectively does it address the challenge… It doesn't address the challenge of bringing more developers and businesses into the Cardano community.

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  A centralized repository of information is proposed as a solution to the perceived Cardano content overload problem. The proposal does not address how this might encourage encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
2.  Isn't it a bit ironic to call for a central location of information about a decentral project?
3.  There is a Cardano home page to learn about Cardano in general. And there will be a Cardano developer portal for developers to learn how to implement stuff in Cardano platform.
4.  The proposal is badly written and cannot be properly assessed. It is not clear who should do the work, it's like an open call for devs or someone else to make this happen. Saying I will hire company or dev without any mentioning of who they are is not the way to go.
5.  Its not clear how this proposal addresses the challenge, its incomplete.
6.  The proposal doesn't belong to Fund2 Challenge, the proposal objective is not to bring developers to build on Cardano. The proposer doesn't addresses how the proposal will help bring developers to build on Cardano.
7.  ""If public education of Cardano is the issue, embedding information within wallets is missing the majority of the audience, is it not? Being, if they've gotten that far, then they probably are at least somewhat familiar with the community.
8.  That said, I do agree that there needs to be a repository of information. ""
9.  The problem statement or value proposition for this proposal is not clear. The originator would need to demonstrate challenges or shortcomings in the distributed nature of communication and content creation within the cardano community for this project to have a compelling case.
10.  Whilst I do agree that we need to streamline Cardano's communication, your proposal does not directly address the challenge of Fund2. I also firmly believe the information you aim to 'centralise', can and should be provided at Cardano's official forum.
11.  ""The proposer puts the existence of many information outlets about Cardano as a problem. This doesn't make sense, why would the large number of content creators be a problem?
12.  The proposal is not clear enough. It wasn't described how it would solve the challenge proposed in fund2.""
13.  Very off topic

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  I have provided my comments previously and this project simply lacks appropriate level and depth to consider it seriously at the moment.
2.  The challenge in Fund 2 is ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"". I think this does not fit in this Fund right now. But not a bad idea.
3.  There isn't enough information to evaluate the relevance and potential impact of the project.
4.  ""More detail is required to assess how well this proposal addresses the challenge.

6.  Of course informing the general public about cardano is an important Task to gain traction in the developer community, but centralizing information is not a viable solution to the this problem
7.  Proposer does not understand what a SMASH server is, and the proposal does not make sense
8.  ""Any idea that helps to streamline communication is a step in the right direction. As the cardano community grows, It would be good to have a place to get common information, a place where you can start with the basica and work your way into the technical stuff if you would like…

11.  The questions posed by the community and comments didn't really get answered or you implied you would answer them in the future, """"im working on the details as we speak"""", and did not.
12.  There doesn't seem to have been any re-working of the proposal based on the comments (not required but you don't have a lot of information in the first place)
13.  If you are trying to get funding, you have to have an idea that is more developed…
14.  For example: under Detailed plan, you have four sentences. Take each one of those sentences and expand them into one or two paragraphs.
15.  You also need to expand on what the money's for, break down the 10000 ada, what specifically is for. You can estimate, just break it into 10 small estimates instead of just saying i need 10000 ada.
16.  You said you wanted to hire a company… what company, or which companies are you thinking about hiring? If you can get a free estimate, get that from one of the companies…
17.  What is your experience?? I know you said you would hire a company but what do you bring to the table?? Are you going to manage the project? Do you have management experience… You don't have to be a programmer but you have to bring something to the table. What is your work experience, and how can it be applied to the project?
18.  Just from looking at your proposal, I do not see a lot of information that is going to get you a high score from my assessment but I want you to know that you have a good idea and it should be developed further. Please do not get discouraged from these assessments.
19.  With that said, I need to grade this proposal strictly on the criteria given. Does this proposal, """"… encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"""". I know you say you are going to hire a company or developer if you get funded but that is not what is meant by encouraging developers to Cardano. Anyone can pay someone to develop on any platform, we are looking for ideas that will get developers and people interested in long term development and business building. We are not looking to get developers for a one off project like this would do. I am going to give you a (2 - Disagree). I did not give you a (1 - Strongly disagree) because you would have at least one or two developers working if you got funded, but that is just not what we are looking for in this fund.

21.  The proposer proposes hiring a company to implement the proposal, on a budget of 10000 ada. The proposer did not cite relevant experience hiring companies to execute similar projects on a similar budget.
22.  I don't think the proposal creator has relevant experience to build a software product. And I don't understand how ""cardano connection smash server"" is helpful in this problem the proposal is trying to resolve.

27.  Also, how would you ensure seamless implication between Yoroi and Daedalus?""
28.  Lacking a clear budget breakdown and project plan
29.  No evidence of relevant experience provided. Budget not broken down and with no estimate on final cost. Sketchy plan makes it hard to imagine the proposal will be implemented successfully.
30.  ""It is not possible to evaluate the proposer's experience because he didn't mention anything about it. The idea is to hire a company to develop the project, but no details were given of which companies were evaluated.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

need more details

I think that most of the developers are capable of reading and coding in English. So it does not quitte match the challenge for now. It is not a bad idea for sure, but for now we need developers for this challenge.

Not address the challenge, incomplete proposal.

While I agree with the necessity, I would again recommend a live translator within the IOHK outfit. Proposal gives no solution

This proposal does not detail how it will solve the fund2 challenge. Translation services are already done by ambassadors.

Cardano resources will be translated to Dutch on a voluntary basis. Better translations would encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.

""Proposer focuses on the issue that the available content is mainly in English. If there is a translating in Dutch for modules, wallets, websites, etc. it is often bad translated.

He wants to make more awareness for Cardano in the Dutch speaking community by correct translating articles, websites, etc.

I'm myself a Dutch speaking person, and I don't find it necessary in this Fund round because the focus is now on encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano, which have mostly a sufficient notion of English to start developing. So it won't attract much more developers and entrepreneurs (if Dutch translating is available). REMARK: This said, I do think translations to Spanish and French are important, because of the much wider impact (~900 million people).

ROI --> proposer doesn't ask for fund, he will do it for free (help of others is appreciated).

Timeline --> not specified

""Proposal does not make an appropriate level of connection with the dFund2 theme:

""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""

Off topic for Fund 2.

""THIS PROPOSAL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGE BUT DOES NOT STATE SO EXPLICITLY.

The problem statement of this proposal is: Cardano Dutch translation. It's safe to assume that the proposer means to state that there is no Cardano information not available in Dutch.

The solution to this problem is translate Cardano information to Dutch. Dutch translation could help to encourage entrepeneurs and developers in the Netherlands and Belgium. There are no measurable metrix stated. It would be a plus if there were. An example translate the Cardano white paper and send it to all first year computer science students and assume that x% start coding. ""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

No funds are requested

funding ?

""I like your enthusiasm for doing this voluntary. But I cant get enough information from your proposal. How good are you in translating and with how many people are you gonna do that.

I would not mind if you asked some budget for this. Because there is potential for translation.""

No

lacks methodology

No information was provided about the proponent experience in translation, nor information about the necessary budget.

The proposal does not request any funding. A comment states that IOG prefers to use professional translators.

""The (individual) proposer has a degree in Dutch Law at the University of Maastricht. He is in my opinion capable for the proposed work.

Especially when there is need for Law making abstracts, etc. (Voltaire era) this will be useful.

He has not specified a budget and timeframe.""

Unable to determine the credibility of the proposal given the lack of information provided at this moment.

No plan provided

""NO REQUEST FOR FUNDS. THERE IS LITTLE INFORMATION THAT ASSURES THAT THE PROPOSAL COULD BE IMPLEMENTED SUCCESFULLY.

The proposer states to have studied Dutch law. Dutch law is not nececerally a plus for technical and marketing translations but law is text based.

There is no detailed plan available and the proposer is a one man band. The proposer states to be recommended (by whom and for what?) but presents no resumé.

There is no budget requests. The proposer states to be willing to do the translations voluntarily, which is laudable. This is a fund challenge. The fact that this proposer does not ask for funds makes the proposal unfit to be up for voting. ""

detail more planning

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

No

A valid concern with no solution.

No information was provided about the proponent experience in translation, nor information about the necessary budget. There is no detail or plan established.

The proposal is just an offer; there is no plan.

His proposal has no roadmap and milestones. He hasn't provided sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge. It's more a quick thought/suggestion for the community than an finished proposal.

There is no request for funds, and the project is voluntary, which makes it very feasible. There is no clear statement about how it will improve developer adoption though.

Proposal does not provide any details around this proposal. It seems out of place at the moment. No funds requested either.

Off topic and unplanned

""THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY.

There is no roadmap. No definition of success. In general the proposal lacks sufficient material to do a proper assesment. ""

04/Nov/20 6:32 PM,324317,1862,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge**

1.  An Arduino library to sign Cardano transactions may encourage new developers to build on Cardano. It will be made available through the Adosia framework. The framework does not have any visible traction, based on the GitHub repository, YouTube channel, and the official website. It seems unlikely that such a library would encourage developers to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
2.  Attracting the devs in a broadly possible sense is not achieved but Arduino is widely used among HW devices and might reach its target audience/devs there.
3.  This proposal suggests creating an environment within Cardano for IoT industry professionals. This has potential to spurr migration over to the ecosystem IOHK is creating.
4.  Great utility for IoT developers who wants build devices using blockchain, but very basic functionality only library for signing Cardano transcations. Better if provide some tools to interact and query the Cardano blockchain.
5.  It is rather impressive what they have achieved so far in development of Iot. In my believe, IoT will, like Cardano, be the technology of the next decade. So a library to make it more easy to signCardano transaction will expand the Eco system. Advice: on dvelopment include also interoperability to the system, so any crypto currency transaction can be signed. It will make it more flecible
6.  This addresses the challenge by providing APIs and examples for what is needed
7.  the problem-solution is cohesive and knowledge repositories are necessary
8.  On point proposal to get developers interested, especially when the platform of choice (Arduino) is so modular and very often used for education and practical learning.
9.  Libraries are key to developers adoption of a new technology by providing an existing brick ready to use and build upon.
10.  The existence of this functionality for developers would certainly be useful… assuming that there is a sufficient set of devs/entrepreneurs waiting out there to build IoT solutions on Cardano. That part has not been demonstrated though.
11.  This project could rapidly bring a lot of Arduino developers to the Cardano ecosystem by providing them with the tools that enable IoT data marketplaces.
12.  ""It has a pretty decent use case. What I am missing is ability how to drive this adoption forward beyond passive implementation of the proposal itself.
13.  I don't see a road map or plan of sorts how this would be publicised further beyond implementation of the base project of Adosia.
14.  Has any work been done that can highlight this need from other developers?""

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  ""It seems reasonable that this proposal would address the challenge very well. However, The Proposal does not provide targets of developers or businesses that will be attracted to Cardano because of it.
2.  If there are no measurable targets, how can success be measured?""
3.  ""I think that this proposal does indeed offer a clear pathway to encouraging new developers to build or utilize Cardano, by offering a platform for integration of the IOT world to the Cardano blockchain. This also should (if successful) lead to new entrepreneurs building on Cardano.
4.  ""
5.  Generally I think this idea is the right direction, but in this instance it is not clear what the proposer wants to build. It appears to be a light client or oracle solution, which has a lot of potential.
6.  This is the direction of integration and a driver of adoption
7.  The proposer has relevant Arduino and C programming experience.
8.  I don't see the complexity in this proposal, it clearly builds on what the dev is proposing and can be easily done. The dev is more talking about his past experience with HW open projects than this proposal.
9.  Proposer has extensive relevant experience and currently working on an open source project. Rough timeline is present, but no detail on budget expenses.
10.  The proposer as working experience in IoT devices platform (owner), and also a well known Cardano community member. Budget seems to be fair and proposal seems to be creditable.
11.  When looking at the Adosia website this company is just a start-up with a good idea. They show a website looking very professional but many projects already created, so I am convinced this will work out. I guess they will create a team of at least 3 persons and the amount they are asking for is a very reasonable amount compared to the limited amount of funds for this round
12.  previous work proves integrating with Cardano should be feasible and within the capabilities of the team.
13.  Looks legit, but this is over my head technically
14.  This looks like a very interesting project. The challenge I have is that the budget and plan not clear as to what the Ada funds are providing. Is this funding a developer to be dedicated to building out this capability? Because the proposal itself does not detail this information I have to simply go off of my exposure to the proposal author. Since I have seen him in the community and active as a stake pool operator that goes a long way but is the only thing I have to base my opinion off of. So it is more a leap of faith that the additional funds are needed to support or enrich current efforts in this open hardware project for iot.
15.  The proposer as a proven experience in the field and the budget required is quite low.
16.  Due diligence was conducted on the web about previous experience with IoT development and it showed that these Adosia guys know what they're talking about. As a SPO and community member, Kyle Solomon is famous for being involved, productive, and a positive force. The plan is well laid out.
17.  Strongly aligned with Kyle's skills and background and a small, discrete body of work to tackle.
18.  ""Given the background and community visibility of the proposal owner, it is very likely that this project is to be sought through and implemented successfully.
19.  Otherwise, it would be unfortunate affect on their reputation if it were to prove otherwise. Namely in terms of their reputation. ""
20.  The Proposer has credibility and the work done to date in the community is a great predictor of ability to deliver.
21.  The proposal seems the be sufficiently limited in its scope and well targeted with a clear deliverable, proposed by a member of the Cardano ecosystem with relevant experience in the domain that he is seeking funding for.
22.  The roadmap is unclear, thus I am doubtful, that the proposer has a structured approach.
23.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, deliverables, and credentials. Existing applications that would use the library when implemented would help assess whether the project was implemented successfully. Adosia platform metrics would be useful for impact assessment.
24.  I don't see where the complexity for this implementation comes from. Does signing a transaction involve more than a couple of library calls?
25.  I don't think there will be a big impact here, signing embedded Txs in C and then making a link with his own project while not providing any timeline or budget breakdown is not the way forward.
26.  IoT is one of the technologies that has many individuals working within the space, tapping into this industry for Mental Resource will be benefitial for overall growth of the ecosystem.
27.  The proposal provides sufficient information about the problem and solution, but the proposal only provides limited tools to developers to use Cardano.
28.  They have showed they have enough quality available to make a good decision about this project
29.  Not all risks are clearly expressed, but this should not be too much of an issue
30.  proposal appears to have sound execution in works
31.  I have to infer that this provides some really interesting capabilities for iot that are grounded in cardano. This proposal needs some clear metrics that demonstrate it directly meets The challenge. just having a library out there does not necessarily mean that it'll be utilized so a plan for getting it out into the wild and in use seems to be an important part of this proposal. Again I have to base my assessment of feasibility off of the authors good standing in the community and previous contributions as a trailblazer and mentor. I don't mind basing things a little bit off of faith but much prefer to have a more concrete plan that demonstrates a path to probably the most difficult aspect of increasing the amount of developers and entrepreneurs on the cardano blockchain. Outreach utilization and adoption are key so that should be part of the proposal and there should be explicit metrics around them

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  The scope of this proposal is not to grand and not to small. Combined with the amount of ADA asked, this sounds very realistic to achieve.
2.  More information for non-developers and non-geeks would have been nice, not sure voters know what IoT means or Arduino.
3.  ""The information provided made clear that an Arduino-compatible C library to sign Cardano transactions is a low cost high impact proposal. The amount of ada asked is fairly modest given the broad appeal of commercial IoT to Arduino developers and the crucial lack of tools.
4.  Feasibility is certain given the team's experience and some already available code on GitHub.
5.  ""
6.  Certainly appears feasible. How much it addresses the challenge is debatable. If you see a path forward for IoT businesses on Cardano… vote 'Yes'.
7.  ""As hinted in the earlier comment - I would have loved to see what the proposal's plan is to make developers aware of this new tool about to be made.
8.  I also am missing any meaningful metrics that would let us know how this project is going to be benchmarked against.
9.  Is the goal just making the new tool and that is it? That's the only thing coming to my mind.
10.  I think it needs a bit thought around how it actually wishes to push through the noise. ""
11.  Without measurable goals of how many new developers and businesses would be attracted, or even how large the industry space is for this product, it is very hard to assess effectiveness in addressing the challenge.
12.  ""The definition of success in the project is clear. The proposal submitter did provide have a clear description of problem (although it requires more effort to understand for non-technical people) and a solution is on offer that may benefit the Cardano ecosystem and could potentially grow into new directions after it is completed.
13.  ""
14.  It is unclear how Adosia platform is supposed to connect to the main chain, or how many devs have an interest in using such a plattform

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

Decentralized cloud services would be an asset to Cardano.

This directly addresses the challange of encouraging developers and entrepeneurs to build on top of Cardano. The rationale for agree instead of a strong agree is that onboarding developers and entrepeneurs in this case is specific to the dCloud platform.

Yes, one of the best ways to attract developers and entrepreneurs is building core dapps for decentralization.

""This is a bold and interesting proposal, but the complexity of this project means that its development time is long and there is no prospect of implementation in the short term.

This initial proposal is to do initial research and create an MVP for decentralized storage. Due to the need for a relatively long research and a more theoretical approach in the early stages, this project is unlikely to have a significant impact on the objective established in fund2.""

Platform for decentralized cloud services for developers and entrepreneurs to build on.

""Unable to determine the link between the scope of this proposal and dFund2 theme:

""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""

I totally understand the long-term benefit of this - just not specifically getting the line of reasoning within the scope of fund itself at this particular time.""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

The proposal is offering to bring decentralization to cloud storage, which could in turn channel professionals working on cloud platforms over to Cardano, but it is not clearly stated how that task will be achieved.

I think approaching with science and peer review first is great and will give time to build a community of implementation partners. i.e. the devs and entrepreneurs that are the goal of Fund 2

Seems to have a cohesive plan of action

The experience of the team is not presented in a way to assess this properly. It is mentioned the team has experience with Enterprise IT infrastructure products, incl. major brands like NetApp, Huawei, Fujitsu etc. A suggestion for further improvement would be to present the team and with examples for each team member on projects they have been involved with and relative experience and professional background. With that said the plan laid out is well structured. In particular the budget document is laid out well and seems a realistic spending budget as it breaks down the cost into the individual categories and steps of the project. The business model document is still a work in progress and at the time of writing included 4 pages. The presentation pitch is well laid out and gives a good indication of future paths the projects might take. Overall given the quality budget breakdown I think a 3/5 with a agree is the correct assessment for where the project stands currently and with more fleshed out technical documents this could become a project that has a high chance of being implemented sucessfully.

as the proposal suggest, there is a need for a second review if this implementation is feasible and part of this funding is to verify that.

""It wasn't evident in the proposal how many people will participate in the project in total, but I was able to verify on Github that two proposers have several years of experience in the data storage industry and this is relevant to the MVP proposal on decentralized storage.

There is good planning for the initial phase of the project, goals have been established and this allows the community to assess the development of the project.

In one of the attached files is possible to check the budget allocation details, but there is a conflict of information about the requested budget amount, in one of the attached documents the requested budget is 225,000 ADAs and in another attached document the amount is divided between fund2 - 177 700 ADAs and fund3 (?) 48,000 ADAs.""

Market analysis and business plan are deliverables and not part of the proposal.

Based on the profile of the proposal owner, it is reasonable to assume that the plan would be very likely to be implemented successfully.

The proposal's team has experience building IT infrastructure but does not provide specifics on blockchain proficiency, therefore it is likely they will need to outsource some work with regards to integration.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

""Mark clearly has background in this space, has structure appropriate research time to front-run the work and then proposes to deliver an MVP in this fund before considering further submissions.

A good approach and lets the Treasury funds from the community be released in waves.""

short and long term goals are proposed with plans for execution.

""As the proposers makes clear this proposal is not for the development of the entire solution but the development of the MVP of the dStore component and further research into this topics. Given that the proposal has sufficient information to address its feasability.

Budget feasibility:

Graphic works with 51 150 ADA budget seems adequate but should disclose if this includes running the website or if this is free of charge of the team behind it.

Independent Review of published Scientific Papers with a budget 60000 ADA should add how many work hours is going into the review process but seems feasible given that it is 4 specific targeted areas for review. The budget should make clear if this is 4 papers or also papers from the litterature list of those papers that will be reviewed or if more papers in that field is being targeted for reviews.

dStore Incentivized Testnet buget of 66500 seems to be related mostly to Storj and is hard for me to assess as I am not a professional developer but overall given the rest of the budget it seems resonable. Hopefully other community members can offer feedback here.

dCloud High Level Design for Fund 3 with 48000 ada seems resonable and actually is very important given that this is an ambitious project that needs a proper documentation to assess its further feasability.

Overall I rate the budget as highly feasible.

When it comes to adressing the challange it is clearly directed at developers as its creating a platform for futher development. However it is specific to the platform so I rate it as effectively adressing the challange. Overall score is 4/5.

""

Yes, information are clear about the feasibility and the challenge.

""Sufficient information was given to prove the project's viability. There is no information to indicate relevant impact of the project on fund2.

There is no detailed roadmap with defined deadlines, but some milestones have been defined to assess the project's performance.

There is clarity in defining the problem, the solution and the objective of the first stage.""

Market analysis and business plan should be part of the proposal. Business idea could be validated first. The proposal does not include a timeline and success metrics.

""In one of the recent commentaries - it was disclosed that there is a major competitor coming - I don't see that reflected in the proposal as such - unless I missed that bit.

Has that been now taken under consideration as what needs to happen instead? I would liked that to be included in the written proposal to get a better sense of it all.

Also - seems to be a big project - I am unable to determine the size of the team and if this is actually doable given timeframe vs. budget.""

1.  A useful standard that would make handling stake delegations easier for everyone.
2.  Nice to have and doable
3.  The proposal delivery date not clear, proposer states 6-month implementation time, but delivery of URI scheme specifications not provided. To align with the Fund 2 challenge the specification needs to delivery as early as possible.
4.  Proposal does not target current challenge, however does take future of Cardano into consideration. This project is proposing to resolve a future issue that will emerge with the Pool Diversification ability on the platform.
5.  It is a lot of reading and it is not quit clear to me what they try to solve. I fully understand the issues mentioned and as they say, it should be a CIP, performed by the developers of Yoroi and Daedalus to be the most effective
6.  very useful CIP but it doesn't directly address the challenge of Fund2
7.  This proposal does address an important issue of the challenge, namely how to encourage entrepreneurs to build businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months. A facilitated system of generating or sending links pointing directly to stake pools or pool lists (either for sharing or delegation) - will help to simplify the onboarding of new less technically-minded users. This in turn facilitates the jobs of developers and entrepreneurs. In short, this proposal does offer a path to further expand the system in a very limited and well defined way that is more user-friendly, which helps both entrepreneurs and developers, if implemented.
8.  Decentralisation is a very important aspect of cardano and blockchain technology in general. The proposal doesn't only benefit small pools but the whole ecosystem. Developers would gain in peace of mind knowing that the blockchain is run by high quality independent pools back by a knowledgeable community.
9.  This can eventually lead to what the challenge is looking for, but there seems to be conflict with existing work from emurgo and doesn't quite hit the mark.
10.  ""I appreciate the detail in the proposal and how far it has come from the very beginning.
11.  Focusing on just the challenge objective itself, I struggle to understand the theme outside of the stake pool operator narrative.
12.  Now, I think there is a way how to 'spin' this. For example - being able to create a stake pool delegation that would allow to support those stakepools that support actual developers and their activity thereof. That may be able to squeeze in the scope of the proposal a bit better.
13.  The project has a lot of merit in its own way.
14.  What I also appreciate is the multilevel engagement on the topic. CIP, etc.
15.  I feel that this would be best suited for a cardano forum post for general awareness to support CIP effort as opposed to this particular challenge at the present time. ""

**Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully**

1.  This could be debated as a useful enhancement and probably an excellent quality of life improvement for SPOs and delegators… but doesn't seem to explain how it might bring developers or entrepreneurs to the ecosystem within 6 months.
2.  I believe in the need to keep moving forward and support all the pool operators and delegates who have made an effort. But from my point of view I don't see how this proposal would attract developers and entrepreneurs to achieve the goal of fund2.
3.  I think that this proposal only has peripheral importance right now, because it tackles the long term Goal of decentralization.
4.  ""I would like to begin this assessment by saying that I have read through your entire proposal plus all of the supplemental links and CIP. I admire your unselfish dedication to the Cardano project which is reflected by your quote, """"If there is person or team in IOG / Emurgo / CF who will step forward and say they have that same responsibility, that would be good enough for me… all they'd need to do is publicly commit to that responsibility and then we wouldn't need this proposal"""". This shows that you want what you believe is best for Cardano, whether you build it or not. I also admire your strong explanation and the way you addressed comments in your main article. It's great having people like you in the Community!
5.  With that said, I need to grade this proposal strictly on the criteria given. Does this proposal, """"… encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"""" Although this proposal will need developers, I don't believe, on its face, it encourages developers to join Cardano. I think you understand that. You said, """"I'm not including """"community outreach"""" in this list because: if the related CIP and/or this Catalyst proposal are accepted by the community, we can assume the community itself will find ways of utilising the URI standard however it might develop"""". Community outreach is exactly what these proposals are supposed to be doing… getting additional developers into the community. I understand you are basically saying, build it and they will come but I believe we are looking for more of a direct correlation between projects bringing in many developers not just specific developers for a 6 month project.
6.  To be clear, I love this project. I just don't think that it satisfies what the parameters for this fund's impact. I am going to give you a (3 - Neither agree or disagree) for the reasons stated above. I do not believe a (1 - Strongly disagree) or a (2 - Disagree) is warranted because this project will need developers, I just don't believe it will, alone, bring them in.
7.  ""
8.  The proposer has relevant project management and technical writing experience. However, multi-pool delegation and IOG/Emurgo developers are required to implement the proposed features.
9.  Reading the proposal and provided link, I assess that the proposer has required experience to delivery the proposal.
10.  Proposer is offering to act as a project manager and have relevant extensive experience, although limited in Blockchain space.
11.  It feels to me that the proposer wants to show a problem (which I do not deny). It's my opinion that only IOG/Emurgo could solve these problems after scientific research
12.  experienced and motivated developer seems to be qualified for the job
13.  30 years experience in ""systems integration, networking, UI/UX design, technical writing & project management."" The idea submitter has put in a lot of detail and effort in his proposal which shows proof commitment. Open to discussion with IOG, Emurgo and the Cardano foundation. So i trust the proposal has a high chance of being implemented, whether it's through the catalyst fund or through the CIP.
14.  The proposer does have related experience, especially with the web related aspects, although team support is not evident from the proposal, which may hamper the implementation effort. The budgetary constraints identified by the proposer: ""The budget cannot be any more than a guess until we know what level of cooperation we would eventually have"" are valid and may prevent full implementation, as well as the inability to harness the necessary resources/cooperation from Emurgo and IOHK.
15.  The experience seems to be enough for the technical documentation for the project, but not for implementing it.
16.  Based on the thorough work with earlier comments and where this project was initially and now - if funded - it seems to have merit based on what we've seen so far.
17.  """"""The budget reflects that neither I nor anyone else has developed related code, and the organisational requirements are open-ended and probably daunting.""""
18.  Given the budget request is extremely small after that statement""
19.  I think the explanation of the proposal could be expanded. For now I see it as a good intention. It could be implemented but it does not respond to what is sought in this challenge.
20.  The proposal is well written and convincing, but off Topic.
21.  ""This is an easy question for me based on the abundance of material you submitted, your extra material reference by your links, your CIP proposal and your CV. I believe you have all the skills to start and complete this project or, as you suggest, hand it over to the IOHK developers and consult.
22.  I wish I could say more here but your abundance of experience, the completeness of your proposal, and the way you addressed the comments and concerns of the community forces me to give you strong (5 - Strongly Agree for this section).

**Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.**

1.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, credentials, and stakeholder analysis.
2.  Work in progress it seems.
3.  The proposal provides sufficient information on usability, however it doesn't provide sufficient information how it will enable or reach the developers to implement the functionality of the proposal.
4.  Proposer is unable to provide timeline and budget details without having assembled a team and assessed the challenges of the project.
5.  What I is a description how they will be able to solve the problem completely.
6.  Very detailed and feasible project
7.  ""The proposal is well explained and detailed enough to understand the overall benefits of such a project even if some lack the technical knowledge. The funds requested is also reasonable.
8.  ""
9.  The proposal does provide sufficient information about its feasibility and how it addresses the challenge, although questions linger about both aspects and the budget. It is not certain that the approval of the proposal would lead to a strong chance of realization.
10.  There is certainly lots of text, but there is little mention on how to integrate the tooling needed to accomplish this.
11.  ""One thing that I am missing are some concrete answers to several difficult questions. Especially those concerning IOG/Emurgo development track. Because that would alleviate a lot of concerns and doubts.
12.  The text above acknowledged these to a decent degree which raises issue as in timing of this proposal. It would be ideal that some feedback is prompted from the relevant sources to eliminate the guess work instead.
13.  Hence, there are a ton of dependencies on top of the earlier concerns of how to fit it within the scope of the challenge theme.""
14.  The proposal reads more like a design document that would need to be fleshed out with significant technical detail before it feasibility could be properly assessed. Given that is also off-topic from the Fund 2 challenge, this is a significant detraction.
15.  I do not see that this proposal addresses the fund2 challenge, therefore it is missing many necessary details. Expense structure. Progress and achievement metrics. Among others.
16.  Because the goal and current state are in doubt, it is difficult to determine the feasibility.
17.  ""This is a 2 part question.
18.  I will first talk about the project providing sufficient information to assess how feasible it is:
19.  This project absolutely provides enough information to assess the feasibility. As I have mentioned a few times previously, you go into great detail when you originally wrote the proposal and you have also added to the proposal to satisfy some of the questions and comments. You have a separate github location and a very detailed CIP on the cardano forum location for CIP's. Your credentials more than satisfy any questions I might have about your ability to get this project done.
20.  The feasibility of this project, as laid out by you, seems to register as very highly feasible. I am going to rate this project as just that, very highly feasible.
21.  The second part is how does this project address the challenge:
22.  Unfortunately, As stated above, I do not think the project addresses the challenge very well. For the reasons stated above, I have to grade this project as not satisfactory in terms of addressing the challenge.
23.  I have to go back to one of your quotes, """"Again, since this proposal is mainly to open a door to discussion with IOG, Emurgo and the Cardano Foundation…"""". I believe this shows that you know this proposal may have been better suited for a different fund but you wanted to get as many eyes on this idea as you could because you believe there is a certain time where the implementation of this proposal would be better -- sooner, would be better…
24.  I am going to give you a (4 - Agree). I was leaning towards giving you a (3 - Neither agree or disagree) but the technical strength of your proposal and your feasibility score pulled it up to a (4 - agree) for me.
25.  Good luck with everything and I hope you continue to try and get this proposal funded or done in any other way possible.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

Invalid proposal for the challenge, also no budget definition.

Peer to peer lending and crowdsourcing are important but this proposal lacks a clear solution

This proposal doesn't describe how it will solve the fund2 challenge.

It would take a few developers to get this up and running, and could work as an example of building on Cardano, but no wider developers onboarding.

Interesting idea which needs further development. Not an actual proposal. ""I'd like to connect with people with expertise to collaborate & strategise""

Nice idea but completely not related to the fund goal.

It is not a bad idea, but I dont think Fund 2's challenge is the right one. for this proposal.

Microlending platform. The proposal does not address the challenge of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.

""Unable to make connection presently between proposal's scope and actual dFund2 theme:

""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"""" ""

Off topic for Fund 2.

No funds are requested

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

No

While I do believe we will see this eventually, this proposal lacks any method for implication

""The proposer did not mention any previous experience, nor did he mention anyone who can contribute to the project.

No experience in IT or blockchain, and no connections in the blockchain industry. There are many details in a peer2peer lending setup that is not covered.

The description is not sufficient to take this proposal seriously.

No experience or examples of work provided. Proposer may be in the process of withdrawing.

I'am not really confident in the budget spending's and the road-map. A little more detail would be advised for a higher chance of succes.

The proposal is just an idea; there is no plan. The proposal does not request any funding.

I appreciate the thought behind the idea itself - but it is just that. At the moment it is missing all elements of a project with an actual plan how to go about it.

There is no real plan here. Cash drops in the 'real world' need to consider numerous legal implications… even if this was on topic.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

No

The information merely descibes the problem and does not supply a solution.

The concept is quite feasible, but execution is not feasible with this proposal.

""There is no clarity regarding the purpose of this proposal, the proposer mentioned an idea between a p2p lending platform and charity, but it wasn't clear how these two ideas will interact on the platform. This proposal doesn't describe how it will solve the fund2 challenge.

As there is no detailed plan and no mention was made of the required budget, it is not possible to further assess the feasibility of the project.""

It does not provide any business plan or go into how it will onboard developers.

The description is not sufficient to take this proposal seriously.

Not an actual proposal.

I see portents for sure but not for now. It needs some more work and than you can see your proposal come to life.

To my current understanding, the goals of Fund2 are not addressed.""

As a plan for action the community in all aspects of market, it seems brilliant

This proposal has great potential, we will be waiting in fund 3 =\]

It is not directly pointed at onboarding developers, but rather helping discussions along in general.

Insufficient information. The proposal does not address the challenge of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.

Out of dFund2 scope - it is labeled as dFund3 instead.

Off topic for Fund 2.

The proposer commented that he doesn't have time to detail the proposal in fund2 and rescheduled the proposal for fund3, as there is no defined budget there is no need to continue the evaluation.

""The plan is very general with a lot of info on the problem to be solved and potential but very little actions or plan.

In the comments, the proposer is talking about Fund3 so maybe this is not to be pursued in Fund2.""

Doesn't give exact methodology

Fund3

The explanation of the specific end product is vague and the implementation plan is also lacking.

The proposer has postponed the proposal to Fund 3 in a comment on Ideascale.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

Unable to determine given the lack of detail.

No funds requested and a hard to read proposal. Can't really assess a plan in that light.

The proposer commented that he does not have time to detail the proposal in fund2 and rescheduled the proposal for fund3, as there is no defined budget there is no need to continue the evaluation.

""There is limited info and planned actions related to development or implementation.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

While I like the idea I consider it out of scope w.r.t. to this challenge.

""The proposal is based on providing a platform for charity fundraising based on Cardano with integrated staking.

The proposal would enable the collection of money and stake that money to increase the amount or pay the platform.

The proposal is in line with Fund2 goals, enabling businesses to build on Cardano.""

Crowdsourcing without the 3rd party cost should be an integral part of Cardano.

It does not bring a lot of developers into the ecosystem through outreach, but it could be a good poster child to show what's possible on Cardano.

Unfortunately, not related to the goal of the fund.

Patreon/Kickstarter on Cardano, with smart contracts that channel staking rewards to projects.

Off topic for Fund 2. Consider re-submission in later funding rounds.

""I wish the project made more effort establishing clear line of thought that would be in line with the dFund2 theme:

""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""

I have been unable to find that precisely - which is a pity because a one paragraph clearly explaining that connection would have been sufficient.""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

""The proposer has presented years of dev experience as well as rest of his team.

Public linked in profile was included as well for the reference which demonstrates relevant experience.

Plan is detailed for this stage with possible KPI's, schedule and rough cost allocation.

Based on the presented info, implementation of the proposal is likely.

""

From the information given, there appears to be a large team

Seems like a solid team behind the project, although it's lacking smart contracts engineers.

The proposal is very detailed and thought through. There is no info about the proposer or the team behind though.

The proposer has a team and relevant business management and software development experience. They have submitted another proposal to develop a habit tracking app.

Looks like a professional dev team that could achieve this.

""I have every reason to believe that this project is thought through.Unfortunately, I am not sure about implementation. I see the author have submitted multiple large scale projects.

I am unsure how to look at this other than deficiency in focus. Which could potentially lead to not having enough attention/effort attached to a project at expense of the other - should multiple be funded, e.g.

That lack of focus is concerning potentially. ""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

""The proposal has information about team members, experience, plan, cost breakdown, current work, schedule and KPIs.

It addresses the goal of Fund2 by building this charity fundraising platform on Cardano and using smart contracts.

To conclude, sufficient info is provided and in my opinion addresses the Fund2 goals.""

Methodology appears sound

The idea is very complicated compared to their competitors in the market, and the feasibility is questionable. It does not state the expected amount of onboarded developers.

The roadmap is not detailed, hard to figure out what success really means for this project.

Roadmap is brief and nonspecific. Success metric of 100 projects within 6 months can be gamed. Proof of brand growth success would be useful for feasibility and impact assessment.

Would be better in another funding round with a more aligned focus.

""There is insufficient level of detail provided on funds requested. I tried to decipher it based on the information provided but it is just too vague:

""""Having worked on the project plan more extensively I would require funding for 3 people for 6

But in the proposal itself here it says:

""""I would require funding for 3-4 people for 6 months which on top of the money I am providing working out to be approximately 100,000 ADA.""""

I rarely have confidence in proposal that contradict each other within itself. We need greater level of accountability, I am afraid.

It is unfortunate, as I like the idea generally. ""

In response to having multiple projects submitted, my team is currently part time. If I receive funding for more than one project I have the scope to pick up the additional work by employing the staff on a full time basis. This both fits the requirements of getting more developers into Cardano and achieves my goal of building a full time Cardano software company. Over time my company will grow and we will take on more developers. The goal of the fund is to bring on more developers which I believe all my proposals aim to achieve that.

You are investing in the project but also my team, we will are experienced developers moving into the Cardano space so you are helping to up-skill an experienced team. We believe we are the exact type of company the fund is aimed at attracting. Now that my team has a taste for Cardano I would hate to see them migrate over to another blockchain - not losing developers is just as important as gaining new ones",NO
04/Nov/20 4:36 PM,322213,1457,nitemagi,"@catalystadmin  my apologies. My understanding was that the cap was $250k. I must have missed the revision to 200. If that's really the deal breaker, especially when prices are swinging 20-30% withing the time frame of Catalyst then I would argue the system needs reformatting.

We are an already functioning company that is moderately far along in building this product. We'd like it to be Cardano but if not we will do it elsewhere.

This is indeed our pitch deck, and includes some custom slides but it is not wholly designed for Cardano.

All funds would be going to paying our engineering team. I am happy to give a breakdown including CVs of engineering team and their compensation structure.

It's a fair point on the 6 month concern. Some of our aims are to include Goguen features and presume it will release within that time frame and still have enough time to build the features. Without that, the primary inclusion of ada is as an incentivization system to wellness and healthcare, including to entrepreneurs who want to work in that space.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  
2.  Podcasts are not the market for the general public.
3.  This proposal don't address the challenge in how will bring developers or entrepreneurs in the next 6 months
4.  I doubt another podcast will bring new developers to the platform.
5.  ""The proposal is marketing and promotion based podcast with a focus on interviews with small poll operators and other persons in the space.
6.  Although interesting, it does not address directly Fund2 goals.""
7.  Funding would allow the proposer to market and deliver better podcasts, paving the way for audience growth.
8.  There is no description of how the project will have a relevant impact on the fund2 proposal. Creating content about Cardano is a very broad objective, it is necessary to define more clearly how it will attract developers / entrepreneurs and what type of content will be produced by the channel.
9.  ""I can appreciate what a podcast can do in terms of attracting right audience to come work on the project. However, the proposal should make this clear by addressing its core focus and dFund2 proposal theme:
10.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""

1.  Off topic for Fund 2. I've bumped the score to 2/5 because maybe some new developers come to Cardano after finding this podcast.
2.  The is no plan for encouraging developers and businesses to build on Cardano within the next 6 months
3.  ""I'm not doubting the proposers ability to create a well organized podcast, but it will not serve the general public.
4.  We need Charles on Rachel Ray. LOL""
5.  I think the plan is incomplete, how many episodes? What will be the KPIs for the audience?
6.  There are already a few episodes of the podcast available, so the author is serious about it.
7.  ""The proposer has presented his work and plans to expand with the additional funding.
8.  Presented work is proof that proposer is capable of delivering.""
9.  The budget would go to upgrading equipment and marketing.
10.  ""The proposer has a YouTube channel, but there are only 5 videos published. He reported having experience with sales since the 90s, but there is no further details about his professional experience and this makes it difficult to properly assess his experience and aptitude for the project.
11.  There is no detail on the budget allocation. There is no detailed plan for implementing the proposal.""
12.  ""The plan doesn't present appropriate level of detail to determine if the proposal can be successful in light of the challenge presented under the title of dFund2.
13.  Experience seems to be there - but also lacks verifiable credentials within the proposal - such as a linked in profile, etc. ""
14.  The existing episodes seem to lack to polish I've seen in other podcast proposals for Fund 2. It is hard to justify ranking this higher in that light.
15.  Simple plan and relevant experience

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  In my opinion, no podcast, other than Joe Rogan can affect the general public. They are too targeted and specific

3.  There are no milestones, metrics or KPIs present in the proposal
4.  ""The proposal has potential and wants to grow outside the current setup with the funding.
5.  The main points are presented in the plan but it is lacking more details, precise KPA and measurable added value to the community. The growth contains certain risks with the onboarding of additional personnel.
6.  However, the main point is that the proposal does not address Fund2 goals directly and is maybe more suited for marketing-focused funding rounds.""
7.  A detailed cost breakdown would better inform voters on how the budget would be spent. The marketing plan could be substantiated.
8.  ""Unfortunately, proposal doesn't go into relevant depth on understanding why the sum requested is the correct one and how it can elevate the mission of the dFund2 theme.
9.  Namely, how the budget is allocated to each category and what the timeline is.

11.  ""Not enough information was available to assess the feasibility and impact of the project on fund2.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Pritesh has already proven through the webcasts alrady created that he knows where to talk about and his way of explaining makes it simple for most his audiance
2.  It is a great idea to create a podcast special for developers to explain and discuss their ideas/new projects. This will excite new developers to come up with their own ideas.
3.  Although the proposal will encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano, it may not be the most efficient way of spending Treasury funds on podcasts at this stage of the process, as much of this content will be also available via other podcasts that will emerge as Cardano strengthens.
4.  I like Kizen a lot, but in this specific proposal i dont feel he is addressing any strategy with clear goals and metrics to achieve more developers and entrepreneurs.
5.  ""The proposal presented has a very broad scope, I think it is important that we have content focused on the target audience of fund2, developers and entrepreneurs. In the current format, this proposal is not prioritizing the target audience, but the community as a whole.
6.  I follow the Kaizen crypto channel for a few months and I like the quality of the content created by Pritesh, however this proposal seeks to continue with the same proposal that has a generalized informational character about Cardano and I think we need specific, educational content that demonstrates the relevance and impact on fund2.
7.  I think it is more appropriate to leave this proposal for later funds.""
8.  Funding of content creation for a duration of 25 weeks.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Off topic for Fund 2. I've bumped the score to 2/5 to acknowledge that maybe some developers build on Cardano after noticing a podcast.
2.  ""I can appreciate that this is one of the few proposals on podcasts that makes reasonable effort to bridge the gap in understanding their mission to the goal of the dFund2:
3.  To make it most ideal - a better understanding of how it will change existing stream of information. Or what portion of output is expected to be directly themed under the dFund2 challenge. Is it all? Is it partial - not entirely clear on semantics.
4.  Because I understand that the existing platform will need to adjust to meet this challenge for at least time period of 6 months.""
5.  ""The proposer already has experience in creating content through is existing Youtube channel.
6.  Clear description of required budget.
7.  But my advice is to stick to the main subject which is upcoming DEV projects, dev tools, livestreams and podcast with developers and related dev topics. Make it the specialised DEV podcast/livestream. Leave Cardano news and wallet issues, staking etc. out of scope of this initiative. If you really want to also share this kind of content create a second channel. It is very important to distinct from all the other Youtube channels / shows which already provide a bit of everything. This podcast should be everything related to development.""
8.  I do agree that there is strong team history and experience that leads to the conclusion that it would be implemented successfully.
9.  ""In addition to being an SPO, the proposer has been producing content about Cardano for many months and is an influential content creator in the community, so I think Pritesh's experience to run this project is appropriate.
10.  In general, this is a simple and objective proposal. The budget allocation was very detailed.""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  The proposer publishes videos to YouTube frequently. Part of the budget would go towards contracting a researcher/presenter and an editor/social media manager.
2.  Kaizen appears to have a well established channel and there is no reason to expect he would not deliver.
3.  ""I have every reason to believe give the high profile within the community of the proposal owner that this project would get implemented successfully.
4.  I would just comment that while Kaizen pool is mentioned in the proposal - it would be better to understand the link - Kaizen pool is direct result of Kaizen media presence - hence I would understand that should be enough to fund it. But that's a philosophical question at the moment.""
5.  In the ecosystem we now have a number of video presenter, each give their own part of the story. Once all developments are done, we need to reconsider which of them is the best performing. For the moment we need all of them.
6.  Clear milestones. Nice the quantification of 10K Subscribers. This clearly sets a goal to be accomplished. It would be good to also add the following milestone: Amount of dev/projects discussed during the podcasts/livestreams. And think about number for this. Next to 10K subscribers how many developers/projects should be discussed in all the shows during 6 months/1 year. The higher the quality of the shows the more developers will want to have show time to promote their ideas/projects. This will create an increasing popularity for your shows and will motivate you to create quality content. A WIN for everybody.
7.  Whether this proposal is the wisest way to address the challenge and whether it is the best value for money or Treasury funds, is an issue that seems to be very debatable.
8.  I was not able to find a plan with KPIs and milestones to reflect the challenge, even a video promotion could result in a nice case to get feedback.
9.  ""I consider the three milestones established in the proposal to be low and are not enough to allow a good evaluation of the project. One of the goals established in the proposal was 10,000 subscribers on Youtube, but the channel already has 10,300 subscribers currently (I checked this information on 10/27/2020).
10.  The second goal is to produce bi-weekly livestreams for community interaction and feedback.
11.  The third goal is to publish reports with channel analytics.
12.  I believe that there was enough information to justify the feasibility of the project, there is a clear explanation of what type of material will be produced and the cost of the project.
13.  There is no clear explanation of how the content produced will attract new developers / entrepreneurs in order to have a significant impact on the fund2 proposal.""
14.  The proposal includes a detailed cost breakdown. Video metrics would be published monthly. The proposal should substantiate how the budget would add value to the proposer's current release schedule.
15.  It is hard to see how the proposal plans to bring developers to Cardano in a crowded podcast space.
16.  ""I am unable to determine the quantifiable metrics based on the following:
17.  \*\*METRICS\*\*
18.  How we will measure success:
19.  1\. Honoring milestone deadlines
20.  2\. Monthly channel analytics report that highlights the areas that are most
21.  significant to the community.
22.  3\. Monthly subscriber survey analysis
23.  It does not give any specifics and targets that we'd need to reach. Thus, we aren't able to effectively benchmark this project as time goes on.
24.  It would require some thinking of targets, whether per week, month, conversion, engagement rates, etc. I imagine that given existing platform - this shouldn't be difficult to compare to historicals vs. projected.
25.  Also - honouring milestones - some of it seems to be already out of date as 10k was reached just recently - which tells me that given the 6 month time frame - the milestones are arbitrary and not challenging enough?
26.  And to me - that's a crucial part missing in assessment of the project. ""

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Clear concise
2.  Yes we need to start building places to grow our dev ecosytem, this proposal is a first step.
3.  The idea is great, aligned with the goal, unfortunately, it is dependent on the third party (gitcoin). Not sure how much the author can really do here.
4.  Direct involvement with developer community with information around the strength of Cardano
5.  This is potentially great idea vis-a-vis dFund2 proposal challenge. Unfortunately, it is not very well put together to make it specifically workable at the moment.
6.  Onboard Cardano on Gitcoin to gain access to a growing developer network.
7.  Gitcoin has been effective at bootstraping projects in other platforms so it's clearly an interesting avenue of research
8.  Having a presence in gitcoin seems logical and appropriate to Fund 2.
9.  Gitcoin is very popular within the Ethereum community and Cardano's integration can be an efficient way to attract developers to contribute to Cardano projects. The proposal is in line with the challenge of fund2.
10.  Its 2020 anything is possible
11.  There plan is clear and if we get this movement started will be really great.
12.  This proposal sounds more like a wish than a possibly successful project.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Somewhat relevant experience and a doable plan with a good description.
2.  ""Unable to determine the validity of experience needed for the project to be carried out effectively.
3.  However, road plan carries signs of fair knowledge - but it isn't worked up in a much detail that could be useful to see how this project can actually move forward. ""
4.  Budget seems low for Gitcoin bounties.
5.  The requested fund is very low (~$1000), and it's not clear what such a small amount can accomplish, it might be worth the risk but the proposal itself is rather scarce, it makes reviewing it quite difficult... Also the proposer doesn't show his surname.
6.  Hard to assess. There isn't much of a plan here, just an idea... but a cheap and easy one.
7.  ""There is little information about the proposer's professional experience, he only mentioned studying in digital sectors since 2011, working with hardware modification and electrical engineering, this is very vague. It is not evident that the proposer has significant experience to be able to conduct the project; he mentioned that he intends to assemble a small team to carry out the project, but gave no further details on how many people or what qualifications will be needed.
8.  The success of the project depends on the engagement of the Gitcoin community and this is an imponderable factor, but the proposer detailed methods to encourage participation, integration and collaboration. No budget allocation has been defined, which hinders a better assessment of feasibility.""
9.  Price / Goals/ Mission all a match
10.  Yes, the information is clear we have a nice proposal to start a conversation about gitcoin.
11.  There are no milestones, metrics or KPIs present in the proposal.
12.  The plan is comprehensive, however lacks a budget.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  
2.  ""Proposal does not go into any effort explaining how the funds requested will be used to advance the issue supported. This is the very basic premise on which we could establish how to make this happen.
3.  I can appreciate some attempt to benchmark it, which is very useful.
4.  Would be good to understand who would actually be carrying out the work - who is we and what does it mean exactly.
5.  Also - attached document has a lot more detail than the written portion on the proposal itself - many people may not even 'find' or read it. Something to consider for the future reference.""
6.  The proposal could provide a cost breakdown as well as success metrics besides Fund 2 projects onboarded e.g. developer community size, code contributions, other activity, etc. Most of the specifications involve collaboration with other stakeholders; minutes would help with auditability. Existing/potential projects/bounties would help with feasibility/impact assessment.
7.  The feasibility is very unclear from what is given, past experience with Gitcoin procedures from the proposer would have been nice, did other projects followed the same path as the one proposed for Cardano?
8.  I wish this had more information or a plan of sorts... but the pitch is simple.
9.  ""There is a well-defined roadmap, with defined goals and milestones.
10.  The proposal is clear and objective. there is enough information to indicate feasibility and impact with fund2, but I think it is necessary to better detail the proposer's experience, the number of people to carry out the project and the skills necessary for this, this information is important to have a better definition of the budget.""

04/Nov/20 3:35 PM,322539,1595,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Fund2 challenge is about targetting business and developers to build stuff in the Cardano ecosystem. And it is safe they know English. Especially, developers, they have English to program.
2.  This depends on what type of content will be translated. Making content available in other languages can help with bringing new people to the Cardano ecosystem.
3.  It is very important to have content in multiple languages ​​and Spanish has a large community, but in this case it is not clear to me how the proposal would attract developers and entrepreneurs.
4.  Spanish is one of the most used languages around the world. It could be a great help to have some Spanish videos that explain what Cardano is to developers.
5.  As much as I love to see our treasure helping our content creators, the proposal does not directly address the challenge issue.
6.  ""It was not clear how this project will attract devs or entrepreneurs to Cardano. It was mentioned that the idea is to translate educational material into Spanish, but the proposer didn't detail what type of material he want to translate.
7.  In addition, this work is already carried out by ambassadors, so I don't see the need to allocate part of fund2 to this project.""
8.  Bringing awareness to non-English speakers is necessary, the broader the audience the more chances to bring new talents into the eco system.
9.  Seeing as spanish is one of the main languages in the world, it makes sense give access to all the spanish speakers who does not understand english. However, most developers probably knows english, since the main development languages have english syntax.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Funding of Spanish translations of videos for a duration of 6 months.
2.  ""I can appreciate the importance of podcasting in another language than English.
3.  Unfortunately. This falls short explaining how the podcast will incite viewership based on the dFund2 challenge:
4.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
5.  This should be the first opening line on the proposal itself given the scrutiny that podcasts have received.
6.  I am missing that link as I have to guess that myself as a reader - which doesn't make me confident in understanding the theme of the fund by the proposal owner at the moment. ""
7.  Off topic for Fund 2, but bumping the score to 2/5 since expose to broader linguistic groups might bring in more developers. It is the 'effectiveness' in relation to Fund 2's goals that is the problem with scoring this higher.
8.  It brings people from the Spanish community to Cardano. It is a great project.
9.  why not let Youtube do it? there are a lot of people willing to translate video contents in different languages.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  The proposer runs a fairly popular youtube channel. They ask for support of what they are already doing.
2.  The way the proposal is presented could be achieved, and it is very good but I feel that it is oriented to the general community of Cardano and not so much for developers and entrepreneurs. Perhaps it would be good to team up with other proposals and provide the power of translation and dubbing to make both proposals stronger.
3.  Great job explaining yourself and particularly the budget/background information. But are you going to this alone or with multiple people, because it sound like a lot of work.
4.  Yes, we have a good tracking record for this proposal.
5.  The proposer has a YouTube channel and already performs translations / dubbing of several Cardano videos. Apparently the proposer chose a budget similar to the ambassadors' remuneration, but in the ambassador program there is a budget limit of 15,000 words per month, which corresponds to $ 300 dollars, if the ambassador wants to translate more than 15,000 words the budget remains at $ 300 dollars.
6.  Apparently, the proposal is already delivering. Funding it will make sure it can continue to do so.
7.  Vast experience and relatively easy task.
8.  The proposer publishes videos to YouTube frequently. Budget would go towards transcription, dubbing, and editing.
9.  Given the experience and background - it is highly likely that proposal itself will be carried through in an appropriate manner.
10.  I can't speak Spanish, but I assume the videos are faithful Spanish translations :)
11.  The project creator has relevant experience in editing and creating media. All the pieces seem to be there.
12.  Translating words in existing video material in Spanish doest simple equal to education. There is no metric to represent what you want to achieve which is educating and keeping Hispanic community informed about the Cardano project.
13.  There are no success metrics present. We can only assume they are based on youtube stats.
14.  Although the amount of translated content is measurable, it is not clear to me how to evaluate the number of developers and entrepreneurs it has managed to attract.
15.  It would be helpful to to have some KPI's and maybe a road-map with some goals.
16.  Unfortunately not
17.  There is no clear definition of success presented. The proposer mentions the translation / dubbing of educational material, but doesn't specify what type of educational material he will translate, so it is difficult to check the efficiency of the project. There is no clear argument regarding the need for Spanish content to meet the fund2 challenge. The proposer set the number of translated words to be evaluated, but this doesn't indicate the engagement of devs or entrepreneurs, nor does it indicate the number of views and audience of this material.
18.  An existing YouTube channel is provided with up to date existing content.
19.  No assessment in the proposal of the amount of developers this could possibly onboard.
20.  The proposal includes a cost breakdown. A biweekly report will be published on the Cardano forum.
21.  ""I am missing basic items on benchmarking metrics.
22.  Proposal makes decent effort outlining the costs - highly appreciated. Unfortunately, it falls short heavily on determining what would be considered as a success.
23.  Now, I understand these are hard figures to come up with initially - but it shows level of depth thought through when planning for future.
24.  I am missing that vital portion to be expanded upon. Otherwise, unknown how to benchmark success of invested funds or lack there of. ""
25.  Feasible proposal, but off topic from Fund 2 goals.
26.  It gave a comprehensive view of the proposal and all of the details needed to have an initial project.

1.  
2.  The use of Cardano to establish authenticity of provenance. The proposal does not address the challenge of encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
3.  Off topic for Fund 2.
4.  An interesting idea towards solving the fake news problem in the world. It does not however address the challenges of Fund2 and is an idea more than a proposal.
5.  Not in the Challenge scope.
6.  need details

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  ""I would really love to see the ADA logo as marketing strategie in a football tournament. But I don't think this is the right moment for this proposal. We want to attract developers in our ecosystem and after that we want to make our self recognisable.
2.  I don't say this is a bad idea(I would be very proud to see the logo in a Dutch football match). But I think Fund 4 or 5 will be a better timing because of the larger ADA treasury and for now not matching the Challenge. ""
3.  ""The proposal is focused on marketing and promotion which is not in line with the Fund 2 goal to encourage daps and businesses on Cardano platform.
4.  The marketing platform, in addition, focuses on sport event and wide general audience for acceptance which is too early compared to the current development stage of Cardano.""
5.  I don't see how this would attract developers to build on Cardano platform
6.  Too early and too indirect, fund 2 challenge is about doing something to directly bring new developers/entrepreneurs so that other people will have a reason to use Cardano rather than another project.
7.  This proposal don't address the challenge
8.  ""As stated by Dor Garbash in the weekly Town Hall on 7/10/2020, proposals that exceed the budget will be automatically rejected. This proposal is requesting the entire fund2 budget.

5.  Sponsorship of a international football club so as to generate public awareness. A more targeted approach would generate higher ROI.
6.  Off topic for Fund 2.
7.  An appealing idea which may be suited to a fund much further into the future. For now it does not directly address the challenges of Fund2.
8.  The potential benefit is more than doubt able.
9.  ""I'am missing a bit of information about what the cost will be. Are all matches 2 million ADA, what does a regular match cost, are there any differences in country's, what excellently are you sponsoring?

1.  The idea is possibly valid but is missing any details for proper assessment.

4.  It's true and you are right that we need smart contracts. But that is not compleet yet. Also I am not really sure if this will contribute to the challenge of this fund.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  As stake pools are an important part of the ecosystem, I don't think tools to help with staking are aligned with Fund2 goal. This tool won't bring new developers to build on Cardano.
2.  should inform stakeholders
3.  ""The proposal is based on collecting and presenting info about the stake pools. It is a great proposal and the idea has been pitched by Charles Hoskinson in one of the AMA.
4.  However, the proposal is not in line with Fund2 goals since it does not empower developers or entrepreneurs to build on Cardano. It simply serves the community and network stability.
5.  ""
6.  I think this is a interesting project and it addressees the challenge for the perspective of other developers using this tools to build better rankings and reports.
7.  Having another website to list stake pools will not bring new developers or entrepreneur to the ecosystem... This proposal belongs to another fund.
8.  This project is a bit tangential to the challenge, but it is close enough to make sense.
9.  ""There are currently two Cardano blockchain explorers (Pooltool.io and Adapools.org) that have a good diversity of parameters for pool evaluation and they are already updated frequently. What would be the relevance of creating another similar service? I don't think it's an efficient way to allocate resources from fund2.
10.  The proposals presented on Catalyst by the blockchain explorers are very similar, I don't think it is efficient to finance them all with fund2. I believe that it would be more productive to merge similar proposals or to seek a different approach in the service offered by the explorers. On Ethereum, for example, there are explorers focused on blockchain txs and explorers dedicated to DeFi projects metrics. It would make more sense to finance two projects that were different and could add to the community than to finance similar solutions.""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++  

1.  ""I appreciate highly the idea - very much needed part of the ecosystem that could help.
2.  Unfortunately, the proposal fails to make a connection between its focus and the main dFund2 theme:
3.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
4.  I can picture what it could be - but it would be twisting the arm too much at this point. Would love to see this project come back at another time for different funding round.""
5.  Off topic for Fund 2.
6.  Stake pool explorer where users can discover pools based on non-technical attributes.
7.  The proposer and the team seem solid and experienced, there is also a detailed roadmap present.
8.  Proposer has relevant experience
9.  ""The proposal has a detailed plan, team members, KPIs and value to be provided.
10.  Goals, roadmap and milestones are also provided.
11.  However, sample work is missing and there is currently no work done.
12.  Based on the information provided, it is highly likely that the proposal would be implemented.""
13.  Yes, the teams seams capable to deliver this plan, i just would like to see some partners backing this idea or working together.
14.  The team appears to be solid and there is no technical challenge.
15.  they indeed seem to be well enough equipped to get this done.
16.  ""The team has 5 members with extensive experience in the areas of development, entrepreneurship and marketing, which brings confidence that they have full capabilities to execute the project.
17.  There is a detailed plan for the proposal, but the budget allocation is not detailed.""
18.  ""I have confidence that the proposal owner and the team were to carry out this project. However, there are some inconsistencies which do not inspire too much confidence. I explain in the other section, too. My other major worry is - the proposal owner has submitted several large scale project which require a lot of attention to be able to carry out. I worry that the attention/focus would be spread too thin for what it will need to be implemented. This has not been addressed in the proposal at all as a mitigating factor/risk element.""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  
2.  Solid tech team with a plan
3.  The proposer has a team and relevant business management and software development experience. They have submitted 2 other proposals. The proposal could explore working with existing stake pool explorers instead of building another from the ground up.
4.  The proposal provides info about feasibility but I don't see much about directly addressing the challenge. The success here is defined as ""5 or more 3rd party developers using the API"" which doesn't mean new devs build on Cardano.
5.  Seems simple enough
6.  ""Detailed and sufficient information is provided, but the proposal addresses more the utility support to the community than the Fund2 goals.
7.  To conclude, worth funding but maybe not in Fund2 due to different goals.
8.  ""
9.  Yes, we have enough information and this proposal is clear.
10.  It's perfectly clear that this has nothing to do with fund 2 challenge. The goal is precisely defined but is unrelated to the challenge of fund2.
11.  The proposal is well organized, setup into phases with its risks well explained.
12.  ""There is a detailed roadmap, with several milestones defined.
13.  There is no precise description of how this proposal will have a significant impact in attracting developers / entrepreneurs to Cardano in the next 6 months. It seems that this proposal will have greater relevance for the community of delegators and SPOs.""
14.  ""Under licensing it says:
15.  """"All IP and licensing of the website will remain vested with me. The outcome of this proposal will be a service for the community.""""
16.  """"There will be lots of free tools and open source downloads to help grow the knowledge of the community.""""
17.  Would be useful to know what these are so that it isn't just an empty statement to lean onto.
18.  Also, have troubles understanding figures as these are inconsistent between attached document and proposal test.
19.  One of which tackles budgeting
20.  The attached document says:
21.  """"Having worked on the project plan in more detail I would require funding for 2-3 people for 6
22.  months working out to be approximately 100,000 ADA.""""
23.  Yet proposal claims:
24.  """"Having worked on the project plan in more detail I would require funding for 2-3 people for 6 months working out to be approximately 80,000 ADA""""
25.  Inconsistencies in budgetary requirements does not provide me with enough confidence that this project has been audited properly by the proposal owner.""
26.  This might be a feasible plan, but it is not aligned with Fund 2 goals.
27.  Proof of brand growth success would be useful for feasibility and impact assessment. Timeline with success metrics would be useful for auditability and impact assessment.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  I see this proposal as purely a description of a problem. No solution was presented, nor a document with a describtion where the requested funds will be used for. I guess it is a compensation for the time spend on the proposal
2.  Concept is coming, but the proposal lacks any clear solution
3.  This proposal is incomplete
4.  It wasn't clear what kind of solution this project is proposing, as there is already technology to solve the problem presented, and there are countless companies and protocols that offer this service. The current problem is the regulatory part of each jurisdiction, because in some countries there are no stable coins linked to the currency or there are restrictions on the use of stable coins linked to the national currency.
5.  While the idea is great, easy payments won't bring new devs to the platform. So this proposal is not aligned with the fund goals.
6.  ""This project isn't currently making the link between its scope and the general theme of the dFund2 proposal: """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  it lets the reader infer how this application could be used to foster Cardano developer adoption.
2.  This could (in theory) be useful as a building block to attract devs and entrepreneurs... but this proposal can hardly be called 'effective' in its current state.
3.  The is no plan for encouraging developers and businesses to build on Cardano within the next 6 months
4.  Remittance system with the feature to send staking rewards.
5.  The idea is interesting but is out off the challenge scope.
6.  Proposer has no market experience
7.  There is no detailed plan presented, no cost breakdowns, roadmaps, definitions of success and KPIs
8.  ""The proposer did not indicate relevant experience for the proposal.
9.  There is no clear problem-solution plan and there is no budget breakdown.""
10.  The description is not sufficient to take this proposal seriously.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  Insufficient detail provided to determine the likelihood of the proposal implementation.
2.  ""There is no evidence of any experience or capability to develop the required platform for this code.
3.  I highly doubt the requested funds are enough to achieve this""
4.  This isn't a plan. Just an idea.
5.  No experience and very low budget
6.  The proposal is still in the ideation stage; no implementers are committed.
7.  No information just description of the idea.
8.  What is miss is a plaan how to solve the problem, although the challenge is quit clear.
9.  No methodology is given
10.  No it lacks information
11.  The proposal is confusing and it wasn't clear what the proposer's intention was. There is not enough material to assess the impact or feasibility of this proposal, as there is no detailed planning or detailed budget.
12.  The description is not sufficient to take this proposal seriously.
13.  Proposal does not provide any level of detail to meaningfully address its budgetary requirements, timeline implementation, or other common project metrics.
14.  No, only the most basic of user stories is supplied. It is clear enough for the app. but there isn't enough evidence of competence or team to do it.
15.  Unplanned idea without sufficient information.
16.  The is no plan for encouraging developers and businesses to build on Cardano within the next 6 months

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Proposal has decisive solution to problem
2.  This is a very interesting proposal, as entrepreneur that want to build on Cardano i would like to see that the project its close to consumer.
3.  Indirect but a cheap investment compared to the potential gain in visibility and accessibility of Cardano.
4.  The proposal makes ADA more accessible but doesn't mention anything about bringing new developers or entrepreneurs to the ecosystem.
5.  This proposal does not address the challenge in any way. If this were to be released as open source, then maybe it would be less of a free integration point for their product.
6.  The proposal offers to offer Cardano ADA on the existing chain on BTC ATMs which will generate wide mass adoption and solidify token utility, but it does not, however, provide specifics on how this will solve the Fund2 Challenge.
7.  ""As far as I love the idea as such - I fail to make the connection between this proposal and actual dFund2 theme:
8.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
9.  It would be useful it were introduced in another funding round that would have greater scope.""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++  

1.  Not in alignment with Fund 2, but an interesting proposal. Consider resubmission in later rounds.
2.  Addition of ADA support to existing ATM network.
3.  Proposer seems to be established in the necessary fields.
4.  No questions about the execution.
5.  The company behind this proposal is legit and does have a working network of Bitcoin ATMs. All the infrastructure is there, it's just an integration job.
6.  The team behind the proposal seems to have the experience required to make it happen.
7.  They seem to be more than capable to do what is needed here.
8.  The team claims to be working with the existing global infrastructure of BTC ATMs and has industry networking capabilities in order to implement their idea.
9.  ""Seems like the history of the proposal owner has experience to see this through.
10.  Would have liked to read more on a real person behind the project to give it more credibility.""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  
2.  Leveraging and existing solution and extending to ADA from there seems a reasonable approach.
3.  The proposer intends to contract development work to Vacuumlabs, which has quoted a cost and timeline.
4.  seems feasible and could be the model for a global/universal system down the line
5.  Yes, Vacuumlabs is a well know partner of our ecosystem and having more POS help a lot the entrepreneur narrative to build on Cardano.
6.  The budget is an estimate, a feedback from their partner on the implementation requirements with a detailed plan would have been helpful.
7.  There are no milestones, metrics or KPIs present in the proposal
8.  It only has their problem statement, reputation and funds needed to complete their implementation. It does not discuss developer adoption for ada.
9.  The proposal does not aim to solve the current Fund2 Challenge but rather, will work on bringing ADA token utility around the globe.
10.  ""Unable to determine breakdown allocation of funds at all. There is a grand figure mentioned but no mention of how these funds are going to be allocated - at least no where that I could find it easily in the proposal itself.
11.  Hence, rather difficult to establish base line of feasibility, etc.""
12.  Feasible proposal, but not aligned with Fund 2 goals.
13.  Metrics would be useful for auditability/impact assessment e.g. transaction and address volume, Ethereum adoption by ATM owners

04/Nov/20 2:28 PM,322366,1537,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  The idea of ​​pitching developer is great, we definitely need this, now we are close to having great demand, this proposal goes straight to the problem.
2.  This is a challenge oriented proposal offering proactive developer seeking. I feel that this is not the right approach as ideally the developers should be attracted to our platform simply for wanting to develop on it and having the tools the need for it.
3.  A very strong and direct way of getting more developers onboarded, with a clear plan for execution.
4.  A fresh idea, aligned with fund goals. I just wonder if cold calling is the way to convince developers to build on any platform.
5.  ""The proposal has a direct approach to the challenge presented in fund2. There are several projects at Ethereum interested in migrating to another more scalable blockchain. This year some have already migrated to Polkadot. I believe that SingularityNet was the first of many that will move to Cardano. I can indicate two who were interested in changing blockchain.
6.  If we have a team of specialists who directly approach developers interested in porting their projects to another blockchain, i believe that we may be able to have a significant impact on the objective of fund2.""
7.  ""One of the VERY FEW proposals that has a clear link established between what the dFund2 challenge is and the scope of the proposal itself.
8.  Thank you for that. Unfortunately, it falls apart for me somewhat in subsequent sections - I assume it is something that can be fixed rather easily but unfortunate not to have it included in the current proposal form. ""
9.  ""I am on the fence here. I am a software developer and get really annoyed by recruiters spamming me. But have a number of contracting colleagues that respond well to it and move jobs constantly as offers come in.
10.  This could be an effective tool, but could also give Cardano a bad name. Approach with caution.""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++  

1.  
2.  Developer acquisition campaign which directly addresses the fund challenge to encourage developers to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
3.  The implementation is possible, but likely this proposal will not be successful because in most cases the developers need training and high learning curve, and this requires time and stability. The best way for this proposal be successfully will be integrated with another proposal that will hire and train developers to the ecosystem.
4.  The probable implementation of this is of no question. The question is how should we measure success of said campaign simply by getting X amount of ""developers"" nod yes to the luring process? To what end? I feel like this is a proactive enthusiastic proposal only offering the wrong approach.
5.  20.000 ADA for 6 months of work (10 hours a week \* 24 weeks = 240 hours) is not a lot. It's about $8-$9 per hour, which is unlikely to attract any talented people, unless they are mostly doing it based on their passion for Cardano.
6.  The plan seems thought through, I rather have doubts about the success rate.
7.  ""The proponent has 7 years of sales experience and training experience. There are no details on jobs or projects or companies in which he participated, which prevents a better assessment of his ability to execute the proposal. The proposal describes the need to hire a team of up to 5 consultants with varied skills to participate in the project.
8.  There is a roadmap with detailed goals to achieve the proposal's objective. The budget is not very detailed, there is only mention of dividing the budget among the team members.""
9.  ""Unable to determine credentials of the proposal owner. Cannot find any references that would help boost the visibility of the proposal owner.
10.  I am also uneasy with the fact that this project has no established team yet. One of its first goals is to go and find that team. It would be a lot better positioned if the proposal already came with a team in place with established strong track record that we can lean onto.
11.  I am unable to judge the project with this level of anonymity at the moment. ""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  The timing and numbers involved seem reasonable, but not background experience (e.g. a linkedin profile) has been provided for provenance.
2.  The proposer plans to build a team of up to 5 people from the community, with at least one developer to help answer technical questions other members might have. They will also need buy in from projects - from Project Catalyst or elsewhere - that onboarded developers could work on.
3.  Yes, the proposal provide a clear definition of success but the efforts we be lost if we dint have a clear path to acquire and train this devs.
4.  It is at all possible that by campaigning we'll gain a high quality developer who will code dUBER on Cardano but do we see it as a probable result of solicitation for developers ""door to door"". I think the better approach is to offer the right tools and education. I can not see huge benefit to the Cardano ecosystem, do we want to attract developers this way anyway?
5.  Clear plan, great execution strategy but lacking on the financial side. A full budget along with a comparison of the wages people like this can get in other positions would have helped.
6.  Goals are present, seems quite well prepared.
7.  ""There is a detailed roadmap, detailed deadlines and plausible milestones.
8.  The solution presented in this proposal depends on many variables but the established milestones are good metrics to evaluate the success of the project.
9.  There is sufficient information to indicate a great potential for impact on the fund's objective.""
10.  ""Funding requirement falls short of ability to comprehend clearly.
11.  """"Ideally there would be some sort of commission system for compensating team members for acquiring new developers, but I am unsure how the logistics would work for such a system, so instead I am proposing a flat 100,000 ADA, split equally between all team members (max of 5)""""
12.  That doesn't sound like a viable business plan decision for the project of this size - it would be ideal to better understand why this figure is the right amount and what it will cover and for how long.
13.  ""
14.  There are risks this money will be completely wasted, since there is very little accountability that is possible short of only releasing funds after developers are recruited... but the rates don't seem unreasonable to me in term of 'head hunting bounties' for recruiters.
15.  The proposal has set 10 developers a month as a goal; it could elaborate on how they would be considered 'acquired'. The proposal could publish reports as a deliverable, which would serve to keep the team accountable, as well as share successful developer acquisition strategy.

04/Nov/20 2:26 PM,322362,1535,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  I am not sure this round of funding is appropriate
2.  Yes this proposal addresses the challenge but could be more meaningful for the challenge if developers could do API requests.
3.  ""The proposer stated in the planning description that Cardano needs tools to support users and developers, but did not describe how this will result in the arrival of devs and entrepreneurs in the next six months.
4.  The most impactful implementations on blockchain explorers today would be in relation to the relationship of SPOs and delegators, but that does not make it clear how new developers or entrepreneurs would embark on Cardano.
5.  As a blockchain user I know the importance of data analysis tools and I think Cardano needs more sophisticated tools to give the community the conditions to be able to better explore Cardano's blockchain, but I think these tools are more useful when there are different tokens , dapps and procolos that can justify the use and the need of analysis tools. There is no solid forecast that we will have many tokens, protocols or dapps on Cardano's blockchain in the next 6 months, so I don't see the urgency to prioritize this proposal in fund2.
6.  I think this proposal is more suitable for the next steps (perhaps in fund3), for a few reasons: 1 The budget request for this proposal corresponds to almost half of the total budget (45%) and no clear goal has been given on how this proposal can affect significantly in the embarkation of new developers or entrepreneurs in the next 6 months.""
7.  The proposal will product more advanced query tools for developers, but will not be a direct help to onboard them. It might make some things easier, but will not be central in the developers decision to build on Cardano.
8.  ""I understand the need of the explorer like this one. Fan myself.
9.  Unfortunately, it would have been better to clearly declare in first paragraph the link between the scope and the actual dFund2 theme:
10.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
11.  This is especially true as it asks almost for 40% of all funds allocated. Given the theme requirements - I cannot in good faith score high under current ambiguity in text vis-a-vis fund theme.
12.  Explorer type is a tool - but it doesn't connect the dot how it can promote activity pro-actively at the moment.""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Off topic for Fund 2. This is certainly a useful tool, but doesn't align with the goals of Fund 2.
2.  Support for development of Cardanoscan.io. Some of the proposed developer API functionality would be a wrapper of existing cardano-node features.
3.  Yes, Cardanoscan has a good track record and put a lot of effort in his back end.
4.  ""The proposer is a software developer, engineer and creator of the explorer Cardanoexplorer.io that has been an option for the Cardano community. He did not detail how much experience he has with software development, nor did he give more details about his academic or professional experience, making it difficult to make a detailed assessment.
5.  The proposer did not mention anyone else to assist in the development of the project.
6.  Some goals were given to evaluate the success of the project, but there is no detail of the deadline for completing each stage. Four sub-items were defined in the definition of the budget, but there was no detail on how the budget will be allocated to each of these sub-items. Considering that the project is requesting 45% of the total fund2, I think it is crucial that details are provided about the need for all expenses.""
7.  Lots of prior work and experience. There is however no clear budget or breakdown of costs for each part.
8.  ""Great track record within the community for the scope of the project. I would have wished more clarity on who is behind the project with auditable references, such as a LinkedIn or similar.
9.  That's to establish better trust factor. Especially given the amount of funds requested to make it happen. Somewhat uneasy with that part presently.""
10.  It seems realistic that the successful author of the existing site would be capable of running and expanding the site.
11.  Single proposer that built Cardanoscan.io. The proposer plans to contract product management and development work. Large budget could use a detailed cost breakdown.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  Yes but i think there is room for improvement, i think cardano scan can bring more utility to developers with an API service.
2.  ""Some goals have been defined, but there is no detail of the individual deadline for each goal.
3.  It was not clear what is the relationship between the challenge of fund2 and the objective defined for this proposal. There is no information on how the community can evaluate the success of the project in relation to the challenge of fund2, as no palpable goals were given on how to judge success .""
4.  No projections for developer onboarding and no clear statements on how thing would actually help a developer to get onboarded and build on Cardano.
5.  ""This is a major portion of funds requested. Now, I understand the scope and nature of the project itself - but we have no way to establish relevancy of funds requested against goals/task and to benchmark it effectively.
6.  I wished this was spelled out in any detail absent of current condition. Quite unfortunate as I've had good hope of this proposal come final submission date. ""
7.  Very feasible, but not aligned with Fund 2 goals.
8.  The proposal has described deliverables and risks, and would benefit from a roadmap and timeline.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Imo one important issue is forgotten in this proposal. I can maging that for the first round every one will get a ticket, because of a 10% chance to win this lottery. In the second round the winner of the first round will not particitate and cannot be forced to do so. Most of the people joining this lottery will loose money.
2.  I like the idea, like a usecase in cardano, but I don't see clear how this proposal could attract many developers and entrepreneurs.
3.  There is no plan to onboard developers to the Cardano ecosystem, apart from the one developer needed in this project.
4.  ""Unable to determine the link between the proposal scope and dFund2 challenge theme:
5.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""
6.  Off topic for Fund 2.
7.  A nice and simple idea that needs further development. Does not address the challenge of Fund2 and lacks a workable proposal.
8.  Lottery pool; the proposal does not address the fund challenge to encourage developers to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
9.  No
10.  There is no plan or timeline and no description or even success stories that this lottery will word. A system where micro credits could be issued against a 5% interest would be more successful in this field

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  
2.  When I read the proposal I can't know if it could be successfully implemented. many details are missing.
3.  Too little business plan given, no details, and not shown any actual demand in the market for this.
4.  Not enough detail available to credibly determine how to judge this proposal at the present time.
5.  There is no plan here, just a gambling idea.
6.  Some start up experience but no prior experience at setting up a lottery system. No plan, budget or sample work provided.
7.  The proposal is still in the ideation stage; no implementers are committed.
8.  No
9.  There is not enough information presented to convince me, as sceptisist of the result of this lottely, that my thoughts are wrong. I hope that the proposer will be able to do more research because I believe that somewhere in the world this system will be used and might have success. But i believe, it wont work in an anomymous enviroment as Crypto is.
10.  Insuficient information.
11.  No business plan and no projection for developer onboarding.
12.  This proposal hasn't included all the relevant information - especially with regards to their budgetary requirements - unsure to determine if this is a serious entry at the moment.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  Off topic and unplanned.
2.  Insufficient information to assess feasibility or impact of proposal. No roadmap or milestone.
3.  The proposal is still in the ideation stage and is missing substantial detail.

04/Nov/20 2:15 PM,322338,1517,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  I agree , you state your intentions clearly
2.  This project is trying to develop a similar application to Compound, Aave etc. on Ethereum. It is basically trying to open widely the DeFi space on Cardano which can onboard a whole lot of people.
3.  Assuming the app is finalized, please describe how the challenge goals are met: How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?
4.  Absolutely love this idea and the spirit is in line with the core Cardano values.
5.  DeFi projects in general have attracted many developers, which can be seen by the large number of existing DeFi projects at Ethereum. By looking at sites like defipulse.com it is possible to check the main DeFi projects on Ethereum and check the amount of money allocated to these projects. Liqwid's proposal resembles two of the biggest existing projects in DeFi today (Aave and Compound) and as these protocols have composability, it is possible that different projects build collaborative solutions using code from different projects, this creates a very attractive environment for devs and entrepreneurs and I see Liqwid as a primordial piece to start composability and accelerate the development of DeFi at Cardano.
6.  The most detailed fund2 proposal that I've read so far. Not only could this have a huge impact on bringing devs to Cardano it could also attract (DeFi) users from other blockchain platforms.
7.  Is one of the few projects that will bring developers to the ecosystem.
8.  The proposal offers to innovate within the emerging DeFI ecosystem on blockchain. This project would be the first of its kind on Cardano and could attract developers from failed DeFI projects in the industry.
9.  ""Building a cornerstone on top of Atala Prism makes this off topic for Fund 2. Because Liqwid undertakes to require participants to undergo KYC using technology that hasn't rolled out yet in the real world governments; it is therefore too early for an output of this proposal to bring devs and entrepreneurs into the space by leveraging those solutions. Remembering that Fund 2 is what would bring in those users within 6 months to build businesses.
10.  The proposer is encouraged to re-submit in further funding rounds when Atala is more mature... or consider alternatives whilst Atala remains unreleased.
11.  Bumping the score to 2/5 though because of the contract work being open source.""
12.  ""I like the general direction of entire project. There is so much to actually go through and review even though I've done this few times on this proposal already. It would have been beneficial to remove ANY doubt whatsoever to include one simple pitch line answering:

""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""  
There is so much information overload that it is UNLIKELY every reviewer will look through everything - an executive summary with a leading answer to the above would have been sufficient.  
Because another element I am missing - what impact does it have beyond the immediate work on this liqwid protocol as most of the time based on the roadmap will take to develop everything - and that doesn't account for delays. So - addressing that issue would have been beneficial so mo doubts would be left hanging over the fund theme.""  

  

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Liquidity pools, fiat ramps, credit scores and delegation.
2.  I see DRIVE, and MOTIVATION , and a well planned project .
3.  The plan is extremely detailed and well thought out, engagement in comments from the team shows tremendous understanding of the material.
4.  ""The founding team is composed of 3 people who were already involved in fund1, the experience of the three adds experience in financial market, marketing, project management and operation as SPOs.
5.  There is support from some companies that will participate in the development of the project and appear to be extremely qualified. Tweag.io engineers participated in the development of the Plutus programming language, which is used by Cardano and seem to be qualified to create a quality code. Appinventiv has engineers specialized in blockchain and are used to developing DeFi Dapps. Credmark is one of the startup supported by Emurgo.
6.  A very detailed planning has been defined, with objective goals and there is a good detailing of the budget allocation.""
7.  Clear timeline, clear budget breakdown, being the SPO is a bonus, excellent understanding of Cardano blockchain and its future functionalities as well as being a team with different areas+years of experience.
8.  The team has already started working on the early stages of the project and seems to be driven and motivated to bring it to completion no matter the circumstances. Community support will speed up their process however.
9.  Very high quality tech teams behind this proposal. There's little doubt it can move fast and deliver on proposed outcomes.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  ""As per other comments - it seems to have highly devoted members - but there is a great need to create plans that are also consumable by the general public, too.
2.  If this was another VC meeting - I would have been a drop out without knowing ANYTHING about Cardano.
3.  Which is surprising - because the website itself is actually very clear and easily consumable. So that's a huge disconnect between that clean interface and somewhat of a cluttered proposal as this one.
4.  Perhaps it is also with the medium of ideascale - but when so much is added - it needs some organisation that makes sense.
5.  I couldn't easily identify any assessment of risks associated with the development roadmap. Would have gone a long way understanding what are things that would keep you awake until this is done.""
6.  Budget would go towards contracted development work. Appinventiv may be a top-rated mobile app and dapp firm, but Haskell/Plutus experience should be noted in the proposal.
7.  ""you have started / you have direction / you have a plan
8.  the fact you are doing this NOW with out funding screams VALUE to me .""
9.  Very detailed proposal, no stone left unturned, clear and concise presentation, engagement with the community, presented roadmap.
10.  My main concern is that the cost of this project is vastly underestimated.
11.  ""A detailed schedule of goals has been made available which makes it easy to assess the development of the project. The problem to be solved is simple and well described. There is currently a gap in DeFi projects that offer undercollateralized loans and this niche is the most important for low-income populations.
12.  Liqwid is being one of the pioneering projects when integrating credit scores to facilitate access to DeFi, currently I don't know of any project that has this implemented, but there are already some projects working on it in other blockchains.
13.  There is a lot of documentation to describe details about the project and the final success of this project depends basically on the use of the protocol by the target audience referred to in the documentation and this can be easily observed by observing the blockchain.""
14.  Understanding of how DeFi works (and its weaknesses and strengths), understanding of multi-asset-ledger and the Goguen functionalities is explained in great detail on several websites (github, medium, discord, reddit (1st place Wyo-hackathon), etc.). All information and detailed roadmap are present to properly assess the proposal.
15.  Effectiveness is simply based on having a functional product (the App) produced within the allocated development period.
16.  Feasible and give the team and experience, this project address the challenge.
17.  Sufficient information is provided on budget and timeline breakdowns. The team has clearly stated how it will distribute roles and responsibilities. The proposal lacks additional information on how this project specifically solves the issue of Fund2 Challenge.
18.  A very feasible and exciting proposal, but not well aligned with Fund 2 goals.
19.  ""At this stage - there is an information overload - for an average person to be able to process this all - unlikely.
20.  Some of my concerns - there are too many personal names, brand names, companies seemingly involved which makes it after a moment difficult to navigate who is who and what's what.
21.  Just trying to understand budgetary requirements. For some reason - attached financial proposal is actually less detailed than the actual breakdown in the ideascale itself. I would have expected it to be the other way around.
22.  It is confusing to say the very least. It is very technically written but not very business time savvy. The executive summary sheet - that needs to include basic business principles and some sort of financial deck. In there - where it would be greatly suited - there is no such information included.
23.  For how great of the project it is - it needs to be communicated more effectively. I have no doubts this will have a good community support (including myself) but just something to think about for the future submissions. ""
24.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, and deliverables.

1.  
2.  More details are needed
3.  There is no plan or timeline presented how to solve the proposal, only a list of requested mone. The requested funds are far over the current budget of this fund
4.  The idea is good and this type of projects is needed for the community however not enough information is given about the challenge and how this project will effectively address it
5.  As stated by Dor Garbash in the weekly Town Hall on 7/10/2020, proposals that exceed the budget will be automatically rejected. This proposal exceeds the budget by 2,000,000 ADAs, so there is no need for further evaluation.
6.  The idea and the intention can be good. But by not developing the proposal, I feel that it is an idea for now, the funds are requested and then we see how to carry it out.
7.  This proposal may address the challenge but the lack of information its turned hard to assess how the goals will be achieved.
8.  The idea is nice, requested funds are the way too much, in general, I would not take this proposal seriously.
9.  ""It is a potentially an interesting idea but it needs further development to make it stick better with the dFund2 challenge:

3.  Gig economy platform where developers can find work on Cardano projects.

12.  Unable to determine based on the information provided so far.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  The proposal is still in the ideation stage; no implementers are committed. The 4m ada budget is larger than Fund 2.
2.  I agree with the proposer that hiring technical people is costly and, from the developers point of view, always a struggle. The solution where programmers will be paid in ADA will, imo, not lead to a great number of developers who will join this platform. Maybe in 2-3 years this might be a project to be funded
3.  Not enough information provided

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Hackathons are a great way to build community, awareness and buzz around new technology. They have potential for a lot of attention for relatively low capital, especially if it is s digital event or campaign
2.  ""Hackathons are one of the most efficient ways to engage developers and entrepreneurs. This is noticeable when looking at the large number of projects and ideas that emerged in the hackathons promoted for Ethereum. See the following article for further clarification:
3.  https://medium.com/ethglobal/ethonline-why-hackathons-matter-a09eec05c890""
4.  I think hackathons could attract developers and entrepreneurs. But the proposal is poorly explained to make a good financing decision.
5.  The idea is great to attract new devs to the Cardano ecosystem.
6.  ""I don't fundamentally disagree that this proposal would work... but I can't call it effective in the current state of the proposal.
7.  Recommend the proposer collaborate with a broader team on ideascale to re-submit in later rounds.""
8.  ""I like generally where this idea is headed but needed more clear articulation as how it actually will be carried out. Seems like this was forgotten to be withdrawn seeing when the last edit was made.
9.  It would have made a good alignment with the dFund2 theme that reads: """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  
2.  Directly pointed at getting developers onboard
3.  Online hackathon.
4.  The proposers experience looks highly relevant, but a clear communication and engagement plan are critical to the success of the project. It is a risk to omit that information, with such limited funds a little capital and a lot of effort have to go a long way. A clear engagement plan, plus backers/collaborators like podcasters or prominent stakepool operators or other attractors/catalysts would be needed to change this to a five
5.  Very well laid out , proposal attracting devs is in the direction of adoption
6.  I believe there was a lack of clarification on how this proposal will be executed, there are no tangible goals and no further details on who will participate in the project. It seems that there is only one person involved in this proposal. There is no information on the budget allocation for this project, which makes it very difficult to assess the need for the 250000 ADA budget.
7.  Apparently there is experience but I cannot verify it in the proposal. Hackathon could be done successfully but when reading the proposal as it is presented I cannot assure it.
8.  Unfortunately, the description is not sufficient to take this proposal seriously.
9.  There is no plan, here just an idea.
10.  Not enough information provided to assess properly.
11.  Low budget, many dependencies, no IT experience
12.  The proposal is still in the ideation stage and is missing substantial detail.
13.  Lacking clear goals and target outcomes. Is this a hackathon with five people or 1000? Are there VCs that would be ready to back the winning submissions to help bring them to fruition? Or is this just a small zoom party for curious cs majors? Hard to assess because the proposal mostly focused on the concept rather than the implementation
14.  Although the concept of hackathons is very objective and simple, not enough information about goals, objectives and budget has been given to assess the success of the project.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  
2.  The information provided is poor. For example, progress metrics and expense structure.
3.  There are no milestones, metrics or KPIs present in the proposal
4.  No plan and no exploration of risks etc. associated with running large cash giveaways or bounty systems.
5.  Unable to determine with the information provided.
6.  A bit lacking on the implementation plan
7.  The proposal is still in the ideation stage and is missing substantial detail.

04/Nov/20 2:02 PM,322325,1512,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Yes! Resources like these are vital to getting people involved and lowering the barrier to entry. I love the focus on women in tech, which has a potential to reach an audience that is rapidly growing
2.  Address challenge, not in the best way though.
3.  This proposal directly addresses the FUND2 challenge (not that many around). I like the Cardano's Smarter Contracts Series draft a lot. Potential developers will surely appreciate this youtube series..
4.  ""
5.  Lovelace Academy can create content and facilitate education on Marlowe, Plutus and more needed to develop on Cardano.""
6.  Yes this proposal directly address the challenge.
7.  A podcast focusing directly on Cardano development with an educational context. There is good potential for bringing in new developers here.
8.  ""One of the very few proposals that makes clear and efficient connection/link between the scope of their proposal and actual dFund2 challenge which reads: """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""Thank you for doing that - majority have forgotten to do it by default. ""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++  

1.  
2.  YouTube series for Cardano news and smart contract tutorials with accompanying GitHub repositories.
3.  Clear budget goals, and an experienced team
4.  Well thought out plan.
5.  As it is laid out I don't doubt that this can be done and that it can be done very well ;-) As to the risks. These languages evolve so quickly that some might suggest that by the time of watching the educational series it will be somewhat obsolete, that to me is no reason for not trying..(potential developer we are trying to attract surely has an appetite for continuous learning anyway)
6.  The team is training and shows commitment and experience, so it can be successfully implemented. Translators from the community itself could be added to offer content in multiple languages.
7.  Would be nice a POC as many others presented but its a very likely this proposal will be implemented
8.  The team seems put together well. I would have scored better if we could see a test episode.
9.  ""I have every reason to believe this would be carried out with success. Proposal owners seem to be knowledgable in number of relevant areas specific to this project.
10.  Few plan items missing including metrics which is touched upon in the next segment. ""
11.  The proposers have relevant content creation and developer training experience.
12.  Very detailed plan, a lot of work has clearly gone into this proposal. This is a very strong indicator that the project itself has a high chance of success
13.  Feasible based on team and plan however does not address challenge in a significant way.
14.  I like that this proposal directly addresses the challenge and that it is absolutely feasible. The budget is reasonable and the enthusiasm for the project can be felt from reading the projects description, this to me is a project Voters should strongly consider to approve ;-)
15.  The information provided is useful and addresses the proposal well. But I can't quite see how to measure whether the content reached the target audience of fund2. Because in 6 months it should attract as many developers and entrepreneurs as possible. Perhaps it will take a very active role in the different spaces where this public congregates. You might even consider contributing to new courses on Udemy.
16.  Yes the only missing part is the capability of this developer to present this material
17.  Again a test episode would have been good. But there is an outlined plan for episodes here.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  ""For how well thought out proposal this generally is I am missing some key moments within its scope. I am unable to determine with clarity what the milestones and performance metrics targets are that would in turn help us understand effectiveness of deliverables (or lack there of).====== METRICSNumber of views, geographic data, subscribers and how long are the people actually watching the videos ====It shows what direction these are to take but not specifics that would enable us to anchor in certain values. Then, we can benchmark these in the future and reference how well or not the project is underway. At the moment, there isn't something to hold on to - and would be very desirable to add them if the project is to go ahead.
2.  I would have also liked to read about some of the risks associated with the proposal and how these are accounted for/though about. For example - content possibly being driven out of date very fast, etc. I recall some of this may have been mentioned in one of the many interviews - but it hasn't been brought back to the proposal with an update.""
3.  Detailed proposal with risks and draft episode plan for the smart contract series.

04/Nov/20 1:57 PM,322314,1510,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  This is where we need to go
2.  The proposal and the comments from the proposer clearly state that plug-in enabled wallet will open new options of interacting with Cardano blockchain and it is explained why this route is taken and not the route of further developing Yoroi or Daedalus.
3.  More platforms to develop upon for Cardano is a good thing but this is a difficult project, with high risks for users in case of defects. This kind of project should not be rushed (secure code implies quality which implies time...).
4.  Yes, this proposal for sure addresses the challenge, when you allow more developers and entrepreneurs to build custom tools to interact with cardano wallet.
5.  I am not sure how a new wallet in an ecosystem that isn't even feature complete yet is going to attract more devs and entrepreneurs. Bumping the score slightly to 2/5 just because some developers might like the idea.
6.  I appreciate the concept. However, it doesn't seem to explain - beyond creating the tool - how will it go ahead promote its actual adoption. Because - that's another item to be adopted on top of the fact that we are trying to drive Cardano adoption in general. Unsure how to resolve this thought presently.
7.  Support for design and development of the plugin system and some plugins for the ENVLP wallet.
8.  Experience and education of the proposer are plentiful. Plan is well thought out and clearly explained, proposer wants to make this project his full-time job.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  
2.  While the idea of having wallet plugins could add a tremendous amount of functionality, the proposal omits the extreme security risk this poses as well as underestimates the difficulty of building such a feature rich wallet from scratch.
3.  There is a an important risk that the project will be much more difficult than anticipated. Even if talented, the proposer seems to be working alone.
4.  The interface has been build and Jeronimo seams capable to deliver a full product.
5.  Very solid tech background and proposal
6.  ""The proposal author suggests - that this would be their full time job - but knowing there is at least another proposal that requires time and commitment - I don't know how that fits into the narrative presently. It is a big red flag that needs to be addressed.
7.  Will there be enough resources committed towards the project to see it through? The answers aren't clear to me.""
8.  The proposal could have justified why a plugin system would not be feasible on the Daedalus and Yoroi wallets. It will be an uphill task to acquire developers and user trust for a new wallet.
9.  Funding this round may be tight
10.  Proposal contains a detailed plan that can be easily audited and the progress can be tracked through git repository if necessary. Proposal was challenged on its impact in the comment section and the proposer gave clear and concise solutions.
11.  He is very clear and open in the tihings he does. All software is open source and every programmer may use and/or test it. I love this project

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  The difficulty of creating a wallet and enabling plugin features is underestimated and there is no mention of how a decentralized community would go about auditing plugins (aside from the simple rating system post launch).
2.  Yes, in the moment you allow more developers to build plugins in easy way, there is no possibility to tell this proposal don't address the challenge
3.  The proposal properly assesses the risks but more relation to the current short term (6 months) challenge would have been useful. This project clearly deserves more time in order to deliver a qualitative project.
4.  A solid proposal, but off topic for Fund 2.
5.  ""I would have liked to see and understand more clearly what sort of activity is expected after deployment of the tool.
6.  Because - tool by itself - does not help do any adoption. Hence, knowing what the success metrics be in usage - that would be a lot easier to grasp. How do we determine that return on intention beyond the ENVLP project itself in a wider Cardano territory. I am unable to quantify that metric - proposal should have looked into it though.""
7.  Detailed proposal that also includes risks. The proposal would benefit significantly from traction with other developers and users.

04/Nov/20 1:54 PM,322208,1453,ola.ahlman,"To start I want to thank the community advisors for constructive feedback. Writing a proposal like this is new territory and the input will help me write improved proposals in the future. Reading it through and breaking it down, this is my take and summary. I took the freedom to rearrange notes into where I feel they belong as it was a bit of a mixed bag.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++  

The main concern on this topic seems to be that the proposal indirectly addresses the fund2 challenge. My take on it is that we can't only focus on educational projects to bring in entrepreneurs and developers, but also look at the foundation it's meant to be built upon. One can't just assume that there will be a healthy network available.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++  

Mainly positive feedback given the history and ongoing development. The main concern here is connected to KPI and that there are no clear breakdown and timeline for the features to be implemented. I can see why this was brought up but the reason is rather simple. The list of work to be done and features added is dynamic and ever-changing to meet the demand/wishes of the SPO community. The ToDo list mentioned contains features I can see being useful but is in no way complete and some items in the list may even be discarded. This brings us to the metrics/KPI. Because of the dynamic development, the progress is best measured by the commits and releases provided.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++  

I will put the fund request breakdown in this section and the main concern regarding this is tied to it being an hourly breakdown instead of tied to the development milestones/KPI/ToDo list. This brings us back to what I mentioned in the previous section about the dynamic development. Without being able to specify exactly what features will be worked on and in what order I felt the best thing would be to look at past history and from this make an educated guess for the time to put in I know I can commit to.",NO
04/Nov/20 1:51 PM,322288,1501,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  
2.  Funding this round
3.  Impact can be huge if shop owners are going to offer the payment option to the shop customers.
4.  Yes this is a direct acquisition of a developer that is bringing adoption to entrepreneurs in our ecosystem.
5.  An excellent project which I hope succeeds but it does not address the challenges of Fund 2 directly. I envisage a fully operational project after 6 months which will only then inspire entrepreneurs and developers to create their own Dapps on Cardano. This project certainly has the potential to gain some funding in another challenge.
6.  ""Not the most accurate proposal, as many of the fund 2. But it can give much positive impact to ADA and Cardano platform.
7.  For example to build a buissness on top of one of the online shop with ADA payment option""
8.  A seamless plugin is highly encouraging developers to further integrate Cardano into their products and services.
9.  If implemented could be effective at onboarding, but the plan is rather specific to just Shopify rather than being more widely applicable to all potential vendors
10.  The proposal is very interesting and important for sellers and Ada holders. But I feel that at this stage we need to fund proposals that attract as many developers and entrepreneurs as possible. This proposal is underway without support and I feel it could be supported in future stages where crypto adoption is greater.
11.  This proposal will help to foster greater DApp development and new businesses using the Cardano blockchain as an e-commerce friendly wallet for cardano is really necessary.
12.  Facilitating trade on top of Cardano with merchants that don't even need to care that Cardano is providing their payment rails is perfectly aligned with Fund 2.
13.  I can see synergies with the project proposal itself and dFund2 theme. Especially from business perspective side.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Support of development of a Shopify integration that would allow users to make payments in ada.
2.  """""" How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
3.  The proposer himself is a software developer with 20+ years of experience. His proposal is the making of an application for online platform Shopify so that users can directly pay with ADA as a currency. This eliminates the intermediaries and brings a use-case for Cardano as an payment system.
4.  As ROI --> 1 developer is making an app (not a Dapp) using ADA as a currency. The possibility for paying with ADA on Shopify (> 500 000 stores). This make (brand) awareness and gives a use case for the Cardano ecosystem (adoption). By building this use case , the developer learns a lot how to build this stuff and he will share this information with the community. Also the code is open-source so other developers can see how it is being made and learn from the process.
5.  Especially this possibility of this (open) learning process is worth a lot as return on investment. Some developers (sitting at the sideline and watching) will take the step to start developing for themselves.
6.  Timeline: the Shopify app will be available within 5 months + 1 month maintenance and monitoring.""
7.  Funding
8.  ""From a technical point I am positive of the likelihood of success. The proposer shows experience and there is a working prototype. What could make this proposal even stronger is to make sure the technology not only works with the ADA token but also with native tokens like stable coins. This will make the adoption even bigger due to lesser riks of fluctuations of the token for shop owners.
9.  The commercial part I am missing. The final app needs to be used by shop owners. That part needs more attention. Try to find someone within the community to help you with the commercial part of the Shopify app.""
10.  Yes, the developer has been proving capable of delivering the implementation with a POC running.
11.  ""There is already committed experienced implementer, who propose a plan, budget for the hole time horizon,.
12.  And the most important, there is already some work done, showed to the community how will it works, and how it is going.
13.  There is only lack of discord channel, to show the progress to community and answer the questions.""
14.  ""The ENVLP wallet must be released before anything else..."", however building a whole new wallet from scratch with enhanced capabilities and features is a project in and of itself which would take years, not to mention is reinventing the wheel (as opposed to adding functionality to the Daedalus or Yoroi wallets).
15.  Experience shows to be high. And this project is his current and future job, so he is already developing, leading him to be able to implement it successfully.
16.  The proposal does show relevant experience of the team behind the proposal with work already started on the project and key milestones and deliverables envisaged.
17.  This is a quality plan with a lot of detail and demonstrated technical capabilities

""This is a second proposal from the author that claims that this project will be their full time job.  
There needs to be clear definition and terms of what that means because you can't possibly have two full time jobs on two different projects when seeking for an investment.  
So if ENVLP project is a pre-requisite - then this should be part of this proposal - or this proposal needs to come at later stages.  
That's generally a red flag for me. There needs to be a specific focus or the proposals be merged in such a fashion that it makes sense together.  
Otherwise, that's odd. ""  

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  The project depends on development of the ENVLP wallet and its use by ada holders. The Shopify integration is a use case for the wallet and could help to popularize it, so this seems like a chicken-and-egg problem.
2.  ""The (individual) proposer has labeled himself as Developer, Entrepreneur, Stakepool operator. He has 20+ years of software development experience, masters degree in computer science and a creator of multiple open-source projects. A quick review of his proposal shows that he indeed can be called an experienced developer. Therefore he seems reliable and up to the task. He is making the code open-source so others developers can read his work and help with specific problems or give comments on how to approach some problems.
3.  The implementer has already committed something. He has made some progress and has visualized it by creating a video on YouTube, shares links to GitHub, … He asks the opinions of community members on forums like Reddit, …. He seems very dedicated.
4.  He has given an detailed plan on how to approach the proposal. Setting milestones, explaining risks, giving a quite complete activity breakdown and expected cost. His budget and timeframe for building this app seems realistic. He asks for 724437 ADA for a full-time job (period 6 months).""
5.  ""Clear roadmap with milestones for the first phase (6 months) but technical.
6.  What are the milestones on the commercial part to build attention at the shop owners? For example after 4 months with release of the candidate version of the Shopify app start to set up a pilot with 10 shop owners to do a pilot and get very valuable feedback. Another: Marketing of the benefits from a commercial perspective is very important, so what's in it for the shop owner to use this payment app next to all the others they already have?
7.  Next to this add a list of what is delivered after 6 months: The ENVLP wallet v.xx, Shopify integration app v.xx and describe which features are included.""
8.  Yes, all information is available.
9.  Comprehensive cost breakdown with defined milestones gives credibility and makes this project quite enticing in itself. As the project does not directly address the challenge of Fund2, there is insufficient material and measurable metrics to assess it's impact on encouraging others to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano.
10.  ""Clear definition of success with milestones, easy to undersand what problem is solving - Enabling Shopify to sell goods and services for ADA.
11.  Already done prototype to assess feasibility, and easy to imagine impact of the project.""
12.  Highly relevant and well thought out.
13.  While information is provided, there is little to support the extremely optimistic task completion times.
14.  Although it would be very good for Cardano to have this service, it is not clear to me how it will attract developers and entrepreneurs in 6 months.
15.  The proposal is feasible according to the information provided and it does address the challenge of promoting the greater developer and commercial use of Cardano.
16.  A very polished and on topic proposal for Fund 2.
17.  ""Generally, similar to the other proposal - I am missing measurable metrics beyond the creation of this tool.
18.  How are we going to understand if the creation of this tool has lead to desirable outcomes? For that we need good benchmarking. The proposal goes in good detail what that can look like with regards to development of the product itself - but I can't seem to comprehend what after deployment looks like.
19.  What is the definition of success? Create a tool is one huge milestone. Getting people to use it another. I lack that focus entirely in this presentation.""
20.  Detailed proposal that also includes risks. The proposal would benefit significantly from traction with other developers and users.
21.  ""The proposer has made a clear breakdown with timeline and goals. He gives a detailed overview of different costs, ... His presentation and information are clear and understandable, as is his description of the problem and solution. The proposer provided enough content to assess the feasibility and impact.
22.  Everything is open-source and readable on GitHub. He keeps the community up-to-date by submitting video updates every time any relevant development is complete and he is active on community forums. You can ask him anything about his project and interesses.
23.  Code activity can be measured from the commits on the mentioned GitHub projects. The projects can be compiled and deployed by anyone interested in seeing how the software is working at any point during development. He will provide step by step documentation on how to build, run and test everything independently. Once the free-commerce app is available to online stores on Shopify, we can obtain reports and feedback from businesses that are using the integration.""

04/Nov/20 1:47 PM,322286,1499,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Understanding from the documents and Wiki it seems to be proven cocept, So it won't be too difficult to realize the proposal
2.  ""The proposal acknowledges the Fund2 Challenge, but fails to provide targets for how many developers or businesses may be attracted by funding it.
3.  The revenue generated is slated to be donated to worthy causes. However, there is no discussion about how this would increase the number of devs and businesses building on Cardano. ""
4.  How a registering a stakepool will help to bring more developers for the next 6 months? This proposal was reduced from 900k to 35k, its hard to assess half of a proposal. I think this proposal should be re applied in a proper challenge.
5.  Funding is required in every initiative, through additional funding we can attract even more developers to the Cardano ecosystem.
6.  ""Proposal itself does not take good effort to clearly and concisely address the relevancy of its scope with the immediate measures of dFund2 challenge:
7.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
8.  I appreciate the thought behind it but unsure how well it can scale in the time frame period provided, less how it will attract the level of development activity envisioned with the fund challenge.""
9.  Off topic for Fund 2. This might bring startups to Pyne... but it has no bearing on developers and/or entrepreneurs wanting to build on Cardano.
10.  Funding the operation of stake pools for social good, and the creation of ""how-to"" guides, which could welcome an excessive number of stake pool proposals in future Project Catalyst funds. The proposal does not address the fund challenge to encourage developers to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
11.  The team is highly skilled. The Proposal does not address specifically all of the skills required to run stakepools.
12.  Scope, team and funds are good and realistic.
13.  Yes, the full proposal has some nice ideas to achieve the goals.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  The team seems solid, they have required experience and they came up with a very nicely organized proposal.
2.  ""Total amount of ADA requested to bootstrap a viable stake pool operation at the moment as not viable. It requires hundreds of thousands of ADA initially to make it good on the yield projections even before touching the amount of delegation required.
3.  it is highly unlikely, given the absence of the thought out plan how to achieve desired level of delegation that could support stake pool by itself.
4.  Not impossible - but it just needs a lot more through put through. Stake pool operations are as easy to make sustainable, much less profitable at the level required by this proposal to make a good use of time. ""
5.  ""There is a chance this will work, but doesn't seem likely when the proposal is focused on starting an SPO for now... with no research or evidence put forward on how sustainable an SPO is as a business... let alone a business capable of funding a second business built on top of it.
6.  Perhaps consider resubmission on a later funding round in partnership with an SPO.. or SPOCRA?""
7.  The proposers have relevant experience. The plan has an achievable timeline.
8.  According Wiki (But how reliable is WiKi nowadays) all is driven by a philantrope. What they ask for is only 35K Ada. Let's have it a go and monitor the results of it. It could be something great to have on the Eco system
9.  There are no metrics provided that address specifically how many devs or businesses will be attracted by the Proposal over time.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  It reads feasible, but not fit for the challenge.
2.  I cant find information that this proposal address the challenge
3.  The proposers prepared a separate chapter "" What do we think success looks like"" explaining this.
4.  ""Again - I like the concept/thought behind the fund.
5.  Unfortunately, this proposal falls very short of explaining how the stake pool will reach the sustainable levels of delegation.
6.  It seems to misunderstand the concept of stake pools somewhat. Not saying it is not impossible. But the proposal suggests it is a lot easier than what realities are. Some additional research content and reasoning would be needed to add to know if it is feasible or not.
7.  Unable to determine at the moment. ""
8.  Off topic and there is no credible plan on how 35k ADA will be sufficient to found, pledge, market and then run a successful SPO, which is the foundation of the rest of the plan.
9.  Detailed proposal that includes market research.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  This is missing the point of this funding round.
2.  Yes, this proposal address the challenge in a non direct way, but there is no strategic plan or episode that specifically addresses the challenge.
3.  ""I didn't find a direct relationship between this proposal and the challenge of fund2. The idea of this proposal is to create a general purpose podcast on the crypto market, addressing:
4.  \- Technical analysis of graphics, which has nothing to do with the challenge of fund2;
5.  \-News / events, which is already being done by several members of the community for a long time and without the need for financing by Cardano's treasury;
6.  \-Interviews with guests from the crypto sectors or the financial market, which is difficult to measure in relation to the challenge of fund2, as the only metrics are related to the disclosure and visibility of the YouTube channel.""
7.  Off topic for Fund 2, but bumping score to 2/5 on the chance that more podcasts on Cardano might attract more devs/entrepreneurs.
8.  ""Likely one of those more suitable podcasts to address the issue of motivating businesses to come online as per dFund2 challenge theme:
9.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build dApps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
10.  However, it is a potentially vague concept because it will be challenging to quantify its effect in real time. I have good hopes that Umed can make this run - but have some reservations if we aren't too optimistic.
11.  We have a lot of competitors out there against which we need to be making our case. Slot Podcast will have an uphill battle making its way out of Cardano 'bubble' to ensure it is taken seriously beyond our immediate world. Hopefully, it works out.""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Funding of weekly video/podcast content targeted at business/finance professionals, for 6 months.
2.  ""No doubt that a podcast could be made.
3.  ""
4.  Umed's experience is very relevant to this proposal, as he has extensive knowledge in the crypto and financial markets. Umed is the only one involved in this proposal. The budget allocation was not detailed enough to explain the need for 145,000 ADAs.
5.  Clearly high quality content as demonstrated by test videos already delivered.
6.  ""I have every reason to believe that the proposal owner has what it takes to implement the proposal successfully. However, that is based on being a member of the community and knowing/being aware.
7.  I think it would have been useful to include reference links beyond podcast to allow newcomers learn more about it.""
8.  The proposer would continue producing videos for their YouTube channel. 30% of the budget would go towards marketing.
9.  How much info does it need to assess how feasible it is to deliver a podcast (especially when quality is not in the equation). It still fails to explain how this is attracting developers to cardano.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  
2.  No, we are lacking a strategic plan to address the challenge.
3.  I didn't find any tangible objective metrics to assess the success of the project in fulfilling the goal of fund2 nor was it clear enough how the podcast will bring new devs or entrepreneurs. The only metrics proposed are data on YouTube analytics and contacts from the podcast.
4.  Off topic for Fund 2, but well executed.
5.  ""Would have been more beneficial to understand costs per episode.
6.  Right now there is 70/30 allocation of the funds between videos and marketing. But that's a bit too little of detail to understand how this budget works per above mentioned episode and also in terms of timeline - how far does it takes us in terms of longevity.
7.  Further, aligning that with Charle's call to match - how does that pay into funding - is this podcast viable without that additional funding? The attached document makes no mention of it - however - there is some reference to it on main ideascale - but fails to mention the bounty, etc.
8.  Unsure why this hasn't been incorporated into the project. And if it isn't dependant - it should likely be mentioned specifically to alleviate any doubts.""
9.  The proposal includes well-defined engagement success metrics. It could explain how the number of external guests would be measured. The marketing plan could be substantiated.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Defi is and will be a driving adoption to crypto
2.  This may add value on an abstract level, but sure not when it comes to the challenge for this fund.
3.  I was not able to see direct point in how this proposal can bring developers and entrepreneurs in the next 6 months, there is no KPI and milestones for this 2 points.
4.  It is an interesting idea that can accompany other projects in fund2. It is not directly correlated with fund goals but can be a valuable addition in the long run.
5.  ""This idea is focused on improving the Catalyst model, which I consider extremely important for the community to be able to finance good projects and stimulate the development of Cardano. The proposal is not directly linked to the objective defined in fund2, nor does it demonstrate the possibility of causing a short-term impact (6 months), but this project can improve the efficiency of Catalyst as a whole and this would have an impact on everything involving Catalyst .
6.  I think this proposal is important and I suggest that it be kept for the next funds if it is not approved in fund2.""
7.  Off topic for Fund 2.
8.  ""Proposal does not make appropriate effort in linking its core focus with the primary dFund2 theme challenge:
9.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""
10.  Decentralized funding case study that would pave the way for a more streamlined Project Catalyst.
11.  Funding for this round may be a little tight
12.  The quality of what will be delivered is not challenged, so it gets 5 stars for probability of 'success' to deliver something.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  
2.  It was hard to assess information about the team, there is no way to check qualifications and compare previous research in the same context?
3.  Despite the fact that plan is not present, the team behind it seems experienced and present in the crypto space for a long time.
4.  ""The ICO Reasearch Groups has demonstrated relevant experience for the proposal, but there is no mention of those involved in the project and how many people would participate.
5.  The plan defined in the proposal is simple and depends only on an analysis of the company's research methodology and a report / feedback for the Cardano community.
6.  The budget has no details on the allocation of funds.""
7.  There is no experience or plan presented in the proposal. No linkedin profile or background portfolio of similar work. Just a link to a very shallow website with a few months of generic blog entries.
8.  ""Unable to meaningfully establish the credibility to undertake the project scope with funds requested.
9.  Unsure about comparison to the world tiered PwC or EY - as proposal is too brief of to make that comparison reliable.
10.  Also, unable to match real life persons to the project itself. I don't know who the people are, their relevant experience, etc. We would need another source of reference to make this a considerable proposal. Otherwise, who/where are we sending money to. Unsure about accountability.""
11.  The proposers had experience with a prior fund, and has contributed well-reasoned views on the Project Catalyst community docs.
12.  Relevancy to the challenge is not clear.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  I was not able to find information how this proposal address the challenge.
2.  Unfortunately, there are no milestones, metrics or KPIs present in the proposal
3.  ""The roadmap and milestones are very direct and objective due to the simplicity of the proposal, there isn't much scope for interpretation and evaluation since the result of the project = feedback from the methodology of the ICO Reasearch Group.
4.  The proposal is clear and the definition of the problem and resolution is very objective, but there is no relevant indication of the impact of this proposal on fund2, considering the period of 6 months.""
5.  Off topic and unplanned.
6.  ""Proposal lacks appropriate level of depth in segments like budget, timeline, deliverable/measurable benchmarks. Without these, there is no moving forward possible as we aren't able to credibly establish baseline against which community can compare progress or lack there of.
7.  Including Return on Intention. It is potentially an interesting idea but it hasn't been given enough effort yet to be able to stand alone on its feet.
8.  There seems to be too much focus on largely irrelevant items gathered from community (snippets) and stake pool operation. Unsure about relationships here with proposal itself.""
9.  The proposal could provide an example insight that an existing stakeholder can act on, which would demonstrate feasibility and impact.

04/Nov/20 1:29 PM,322271,1489,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  It is very difficult to figure out how the proposal intends to address the challenge. There does not seem to be any metrics provided for measurement of how many new Devs and Businesses might be attracted as a result of the proposal's efforts.
2.  I watched his video. He did not impressed me enough to be sure the project will be carried out with enthousiasm
3.  The reason given why this will attract developers is to far fetched.
4.  After reading all the project details I still don't understand what will be the deliverable of this project
5.  This proposal was a bit hard to assess, it was difficult to sintetize the idea in something piratical to understand. One point that lead me to believe this proposal don't address the challenge in full extent is because is too much focused in the ppl that don't know nothing about crypto. This challenge is focused in developers because we need to attract a lot of ppl that already in the crypto sphere like ethereum.
6.  A very original idea to constantly offer Cardano related content. Can help with bringing new developers to the Cardano ecosystem.
7.  Off topic for Fund 2... but an intriguing idea. I hope the proposer continues to progress this with additional collaborators and considers re-submission on later funding rounds.
8.  ""There is a moderate attempt to establish clear link between scope of this proposal and dFund2 challenge that reads:
9.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
10.  I would have loved a straight forward answer instead. The proposal reads more like an essay initially than targeted attempt to convey a business logic behind it.
11.  Funding of content creation for a 24/7 stream. Comes with a web app. The proposal does not address the fund challenge to encourage developers to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++  

1.  
2.  ""The intent is to do a 24/7/365 live stream. The Proposer is the only live person identified.
3.  What is found in the text and the video attachments is a collection of concepts. The concepts provide very little detail about how the Proposer's experience is utilized.
4.  The plan could be better laid out to allow for the reader or voter to quickly get a feel for the success criteria.""
5.  Realistic goals and funding.
6.  No experience detailed in the proposal
7.  The execution plan need better explanation, some developments topics was very vague, like maybe we do this or not.
8.  I'm not sure if a single proposer can achieve this very ambitious goal but I would love to see it happen. The proposer seems to have thought it through and is good at communicating progress regualrly.
9.  The idea and production skills look promising, but more contributors needed.
10.  ""Unable to determine who is the owner of the project beyond nickname/and 4 uploaded videos - some showing a face.
11.  No clue as how to reference that independently - nor there is any attempt to showcase own experience/past engagements throughout the text provided.
12.  There just isn't enough information to establish this base.""
13.  The proposal is missing substantial detail. It mentions that two people are ""needed to advance past mvp"" but not what they would work on. A Gantt chart would be ""coming at some point"" but has not been added.
14.  ""While there is a great deal of text and video content provided, there is a lack of clear and distinct planning with timelines and metrics.
15.  There is only one person identified in the team, and this is to be a 24/7/365 live stream effort. This proposal would require a dedicated team of several people in front of the camera. This would not be the only personnel required, as there is a content Curation piece as well.
16.  ""
17.  It is my opinion that the proposor need more time to work out his plans. Maybe it is better for him and the community to try it again in the future
18.  It is not effective at attracting developers.
19.  No credentials and no past experience detailed so not sufficient information on the feasibility of the project

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  
2.  To me seams clear that this proposal seek laymen adoption, and this is not the case for this challenge.
3.  Roadmap and auditability sections are provided.
4.  Seems like it might work with more collaborators, but needs to be re-submitted in a more aligned funding round.
5.  ""There isn't enough information presented in a good and readable way. It seems like the proposal here wasn't updated or cleaned up prior final submission deadline. Which brings me to the point that I don't know what details to follow presumably.
6.  For example - budget has """"work in progress"""" - """"gantt chart coming at some point"""" and similar word snippets that raise my eyebrows somewhat.
7.  There is also irrelevant information included such as Cardano protocol treasury calc sheet - unsure significance here.
8.  When it comes to deliverables - there is no base of information that actually establishes benchmarking figures. And that's the problem with the entire proposal - it is too vague.
9.  Should mention - that the SWOT analysis was appreciated and some good thoughts on there. However - that generally needs greater commentary.
10.  Thus - give all above - cannot reasonably establish base line metrics of this project given some insecurities from the details provided.""
11.  The proposal is missing substantial detail.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  It's a learning show for developers, even offers bounties in ADA if the viewer can fix some bug in the code. When a new person decides to become a Cardano developer, this is the material that will move them forward.
2.  Entry-level content for developers to digest in video format and hosting of code snippets relevant to the presented content is tackling the very core of this challenge.
3.  This is a great proposal and it is already delivering nice sample content upfront for our community.
4.  perfectly aligned with the challenge
5.  The videos act as good educational entry gateways to both non-Haskell developers considering Cardano and background material for entrepreneurs wanted to explore the possibilities of the space.
6.  One of the few proposals that actually tries to actively address the issue of the dFund 2 theme and its own scope. Thank you for making that distinction clear.
7.  Funding of a video series where the proposer learns Plutus from a developer.
8.  Funding this round
9.  Since the plan is simple - number of episodes in a given time frame - and there are already 5 episodes on the YouTube channel (self-funded), there should be no obstacles.
10.  There are already videos done.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  This proposal demonstrate that already have the means to deliver content to our community.
2.  This team provided a POC through this serie of 5 Youtube video, great content
3.  I love the idea of it being free on YouTube, I'm just not confident you will get the viewership/exposure we all would hope/expect. I feel a website that runs alongside the YouTube channel would be necessary (if not the only place to view the videos).
4.  Test videos delivered already look really good. The team just needs to keep doing more of the same.
5.  ""I would have liked to read more on each individual team member profiles to establish the credibility a bit further. Such as LinkedIn profile, background, etc.
6.  If I weren't member of the community it would be difficult for an outsider to determine that legitimacy. I think that would go a long way - proper team introduction. Couldn't find it on the website either - which is already a step separated from proposal itself. ""
7.  The proposer would continue producing videos for their YouTube channel. The budget would go to the developers and viewer prizes.
8.  laid out nice very understandable
9.  The proposal and the idea are straightforward, easy to understand and, considering that this project is ongoing, should be relatively easy to deliver.
10.  It is already in development and episodes made.
11.  Yes, this proposal is spot on
12.  This team provided a POC through this serie of 5 Youtube video, they are likely to deliver

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  
2.  Test videos were very good an demonstrating feasibility and the content is very on topic for Fund 2.
3.  ""Missing benchmarking capability of the proposal. There is desired target of episodes to be made but the proposal doesn't go beyond that. Namely - what the the conversion rate like - how many viewers is target, how many interactions/shares/likes, etc. It would be great to understand to see how project is on pace or not. Now, these needn't to be perfect - but they are great way to self-check whether estimates were realistic or not when next review cycle comes. There just isn't anything to meaningfully review progress/feasibility outside of projected cadence of output. That output needs to be measured against something tangible - which I wasn't able to locate within the proposal itself.
4.  In terms of budget - it is broken down into three categories:
5.  BUDGET
6.  """"$3000 HOST Haskell DEV a month ($375 an Episode)
7.  $3000 HOST Front-end DEV a month ($375 an Episode)
8.  $800 monthly for prizes for viewers""""
9.  Which together gives us 6,800 USD. Which is pretty straight forward to decipher. But then the funding requirements listed actually are 13,600 USD - which doesn't take good depth/detail what differences are for exactly. Unsure why that is which leaves me with some question marks
10.  The proposal would benefit from traction within the developer community.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  proof is in the work , current product is great
2.  My comments on this rating are similar to the feasibility score. The work proposed here is valuable to the ecosystem, but I do not see a direct linkage to the challenge goals.
3.  The proposal tries to solve a perceived decentralization problem and does not have the goal to attract developers to the cardano platform.
4.  This proposal does not seek to directly attract outside developers to the Cardano platform, but rather create a more fair and even playing field for SPOs and delegators in order to spur innovation within the existing ecosystem.
5.  The proposal benefits SPOs, whereas the challenge targets developers and entrepreneurs. Can you elaborate how your proposal attracts businesses other than SPOs?
6.  The proposal in itself is great, but has nothing to do with he challenge given.
7.  This proposal aims to improve the PoolTool, improve the interaction between SPOs and stakeholders and provide more metrics and services. This proposal has the potential to improve several important aspects for the sustainability of the blockchain, giving additional options for SPOs and delegators, but it is not clear how this can bring devs and entrepreneurs in the next 6 months.
8.  ""Possible to extend the proposal with integrations and further services ontop of Cardano.
9.  Otherwise an extremely indirect way to address the challenge ""
10.  This proposal does effectively address the challenge of onboarding new businesses and facilitating the development of new Dapps.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  This proposal is addressing a very important aspect of PoS: Allowing SPO's to directly interact with their delegators. This would enable SPOs to establish a 'community' with high retention and would help to counteract the threat that 'zero fee pools' will dominate the scene. My only BUT is, that I see this proposal slightly outside the challenge formulated by this fund 2 (even though this can trigger a lot of application development and multiplication later-on)
2.  Pooltool is a well known and widely used community tool. This project is trying to create a dialogue between SPO's and their delegators wanting to fulfil potential needs found. I don't see this directly relating to our challenge although many might find use for such a communication channel.
3.  ""Off topic for Fund 2. The goal is to attract more devs and/or entrepreneurs. Whilst you could argue that this proposal might attract new SPOs it is difficult to justify that is needed in the current saturated SPO market with k = 150
4.  Consider later funding rounds""
5.  ""Proposal itself misses a grand opportunity to make the clear connection between its core scope and the dFund2 theme challenge which reads:
6.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
7.  In the ideascale proposal word dApp is used one, in the attached proposal it is used only twice - and in each instance it isn't the focus of the message.
8.  I can imagine what it could take but the proposal should make this clear in the first paragraph so there would be no confusion left.
9.  It is unfortunate - because it is a fantastic idea on its own merit - but based on this criteria - unsure how to rate it better. As there is no proper branch to hold on to provided by the proposal as it reads at the moment.""
10.  Enable stake pool operators to differentiate themselves with non-monetary incentives.
11.  Great product / service / value
12.  Given the author of this proposal is already building out the PoolTool platform and has provided an incredibly valuable website without any direct compensation is a testament to the dedication and capability. High confidence that this proposal would be implemented successfully. My concerns are not on the ""what"", but more on the ""why"" and how these features achieve the challenge goals.
13.  The quality of Sky is beyond doubts. Implemention of the proposal is nearly guaranteed.
14.  The team already built a great product which is widely use in the cardano ecosystem and continues to evolve.
15.  The proposer team consists of individuals working with SPOs and are the creators of PoolTool.io. With their expertise and outside help, they should be able to bring their plan to fruition.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  This team has already proven itself, but still the proposal is very ambitious and the time frame might not allow it.
2.  The 3 people involved in the proposal are active members of the community and are already working on the development of the PoolTool, which shows commitment. There was a decent detailing of the budget of 210000 ADAs in relation to the established objectives. There was a good detailing of the goals in general, with well defined execution times.
3.  Not enough risk analysis given the unclear airoso offerings from spos
4.  The team has relevant experience behind them as well as proof of commitment to the Cardano ecosystem and its interest. Deliverables are clear and there is a timetable that is realistic.
5.  There is a very experienced and 'result-proven' team behind this proposal. The team is already committed and shows very reasonable planning with milestones, activities and a proper project roadmap.
6.  As per the proven record of these actors the implementation can be expected to be a success.
7.  The proposal looks pretty well put together and seems reasonable that the team would execute well.
8.  I have every confidence that given the high profile trio of proposal owners - this is very likely to be implemented successfully.
9.  The proposers built PoolTool.io. The roadmap and timeline appear achievable.
10.  Would think this would grow and grow and funding is needed
11.  While this fantastic proposal deepens the cardano ecosystem, it is not clear to me how effectively it addresses the challenge. The goal is NEW adoption, developers, ada holders, etc. New adoption would be a second order affect, not a direct goal of this project. It does have potential for establishing new lines of business for SPOs, but lacks clear examples of what those businesses and services might be
12.  Changing the app will hardly effect the situation for small Tool operators. The system needs adaption
13.  As stated before, the proposal addresses a different problem than the one posed in the fund2 challenge.
14.  Well laid out plan, but lacks detail on budget spending and timeline breakdown.
15.  The feasibility is convincing but the challenge is not addressed.
16.  Goals, deadlines and definition of success were well established, making the monitoring of development and fulfillment of goals very objective for the community. All of this information helps to clarify the impact of the project on structuring the blockchain with respect to SPOs and delegators, but it is unclear how these changes and improvements will attract devs and entrepreneurs in the next 6 months.
17.  Missing potential offerings, how they would be implemented, and how it could address the actual challenge
18.  I agree that there is enough information on the feasibility of the proposal. A third-party pool information system is of great value to Cardano right now, especially if it can be improved with these planned tools for direct communication between SPOs and staking parties.
19.  The team has provided good background information, including goals and a clear 'definitions of done' for the different milestones. My only concern is that the effect of this very useful work will not show within or directly after the 6 months periods of fund 2. This will probably take some time for unfolding its multiplying growth potential with regards to activating developers and entrepreneurs.
20.  This is a useful platform to many already having high reliability and wide usefulness to the whole community. Should you wish to establish the communication channel between your SPO and find spending 210000 ADA for it reasonable then ok. I feel personally that I have no such need.
21.  Seems feasible, just off topic for Fund 2.
22.  ""I have concerns that KPIs are set conservatively too low. 5% stake address participation 6 months from now seems unreasonably low. It could be not - but then the KPIs need additional level of detail to help understand how these KPIs are reasonable and not arbitrary in its essence. Namely, are they too safe or just right?
23.  Randomizer item is missing timeline block in the graphics. But that's just a detail.
24.  More importantly, I am missing sense of budget allocation against the timeline provided. And its distribution towards each element/or person if this is based on work hours input solely.
25.  There is only one big figure and it falls short just there.
26.  Unsure what to make of that at the moment. ""
27.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, credentials, and stakeholder analysis.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  The idea is sound drives adoption
2.  Although the statement in the proposal might be true, this is not the time, with the limited funds of this fund, to think out enabling stock markets to a continent of which most people are still unbanked
3.  Outside of the creation of the proposed dApp, this project does not seek to attract developers long term.
4.  It is not very likely in my opinion that this proposal will succeed due to a lack of a sensible plan and budget for the task described, team in charge and relevant experience.
5.  I cant see this proposal addressing the challenge, this proposal is incomplete, lacks a better scope, road map, details of companies, teams and management skill.
6.  Maybe it's a good idea for the future, and so far it's just that, I don't see that it meets the current need for fund2. It would be different if it aims to find developers and entrepreneurs in those countries.
7.  The challenge is to attract developers to the cardano platform and not to funds.
8.  Requested fund higher than the total fund available
9.  This would be a good example project if it came with more credibity.
10.  As stated by Dor Garbash in the weekly Town Hall on 7/10/2020, proposals that exceed the budget will be automatically rejected. This proposal exceeds the budget by 1,000,000 ADAs, so there is no need for further evaluation.
11.  This project lacks to make the connection between the fund2 theme and is goal.
12.  Off topic for Fund 2.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  
2.  The is no plan for encouraging developers and businesses to build on Cardano within the next 6 months
3.  The proposal does not address the fund challenge of encouraging developers to build on Cardano in the next 6 months.
4.  Need more detail
5.  I was not able to find out how this proposer solves the problem. So i cannot make a statement whether this plan could be successful.
6.  The proposer does not clearly state what relevant experience they have which might help bring this project to fruition.
7.  The experience of the proposer and the lack of a structured plan, make this proposal unlikely to succeed.
8.  Can't find a plan
9.  The proposal is too little developed to know if it could be successful.
10.  There is nothing to assess in this proposal.
11.  no credentials and not enough information provided
12.  No. Nothing is stated
13.  As stated by Dor Garbash in the weekly Town Hall on 7/10/2020, proposals that exceed the budget will be automatically rejected. This proposal exceeds the budget by 1,000,000 ADAs, so there is no need for further evaluation.
14.  It provides no additional detail that would enable us to look more effectively into what/or who is proposing this idea.
15.  Vague idea with no plan. Also requesting more funds that in this round
16.  Extremely lacking plan and no experience.
17.  The proposal is still in the ideation stage and is missing substantial detail.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  Funding is not for this round
2.  The proposer provides sufficient information in order to determine that this project does not align with the current Fund2 Challenge.
3.  The lack of a timetable, milestones and an effective team make it more of an intangible wish than a specific plan
4.  There is no sufficient information
5.  Metrics are not presented to evaluate results.
6.  It is not even trying. There is nothing to assess in this proposal.
7.  no credentials and not enough information provided
8.  In my opinion it is far too soon to make a dapp for stock market succeful for the unbanked. I believe that there are more important issues to be solved first
9.  Suggestijg to contract out an idea written out in two paragraphs is ludicrous
10.  As stated by Dor Garbash in the weekly Town Hall on 7/10/2020, proposals that exceed the budget will be automatically rejected. This proposal exceeds the budget by 1,000,000 ADAs, so there is no need for further evaluation.
11.  ""The amount requested is not met with enough effort invested to highlight its use, budget, benchmarks, etc.
12.  At this point this proposal lacks anything actionable. ""
13.  Off topic and unplanned
14.  The is no plan for encouraging developers and businesses to build on Cardano within the next 6 months
15.  The proposal is still in the ideation stage and is missing substantial detail.

04/Nov/20 1:18 PM,322239,1475,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  your videos are very informative / timely / and needed
2.  Podcast is heavily directed towards tech developments and sharing of Cardano ideas and future possibilities. It is not a run of the mill news feed. It is very helpful to beginners and also communicates on very technical levels which are over the head of most beginners. I feel that there is real value in this podcast as it is bringing together new members and experienced developers in an atmosphere of learning and community propagation. Not an entertainment channel on any level, except for the great personalities of the persons involved.
3.  Showcasing developments on the Cardano Aura Podcast would certainly demonstrate the creative potential available by building on Cardano. I see interviews with community members, interest groups and etc, highlighting the vibrant ecosystem which exists below the surface. Friendly Q and A's with the community and we have a welcoming approach to encouraging participation and further developments in Cardano. I would however have liked to see some relevant measurable metrics on the number of actual projects you encouraged to build on Cardano for ROI rather than focusing merely on YouTube conversion rates as a benchmark.
4.  ""Providing a media outlet (youtube) for developers and businesses to discuss what they are building has value in spreading the word and attracting more to build on Cardano.
5.  This sort of long format media is growing in favor for exploring ideas.""
6.  Fails to address challenge.
7.  This proposal does not aim to attract developers from other projects/industries, but rather give them an ability to broadcast their projects once they have decided to work with Cardano platform.
8.  This proposal does envisage the development of a supportive independent platform for Cardano developers and entrepreneurs who want to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months. What is lacking is a specific number of DApp developers and entrepreneurs who will be ""targeted"" for participation. The door must be open for them to contract the Podcast, but does the Podcast have a well defined plan how to actively seek the best candidates in its target population?
9.  ""
10.  Although the content that is proposed is very valuable and it is very necessary but at this stage I think we need to create tools to make it easier to enter and create in cardano. I think this podcast would serve to spread the word about those who are already in cardano, but I don't see a clear proposal that explains how to attract new developers and entrepreneurs.
11.  ""
12.  The proposal does not even try to make the point of attracting developers to the ecosystem. The challenge of this fund is not to attract developers to appear on youtube videos.
13.  It is my personal opinion that Cardano podcasts won't be a very effective way of onboarding new users and developers into the community for the simple reason that their streamer base are in large majority ones who are already a part of the community as the content is not broad enough for a larger audience from which to draw new users in.
14.  ""I don't see how this interview channel can be effective in attracting new devs or entrepreneurs, because this YouTube channel has less than 5,000 subscribers and the majority of the audience is from the Cardano community, our own echo chamber. This is not a problem exclusive to the Big Pey channel, as all Cardano's YouTube channels have a small number of subscribers.
15.  In addition, there are already countless channels on Youtube that cover news related to Cardano's ecosystem and allocating 150000 ADAs to a project that is already being carried out by countless Youtube channels did not give me any solid reason to indicate a good return for fund2.""
16.  Yes, its very important to reach out the community with content about developers and entrepreneurs in or own ecosystem, if other developers can understand they have a nice place to reach the community it will help and encourage creation of more dapps in Cardano
17.  Off topic for Fund 2, but bumping score to 2/5 on the chance that more podcasts on Cardano might attract more devs/entrepreneurs.
18.  ""This proposal makes a good effort explaining how to align it better with the dFund2 challenge:
19.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
20.  It falls a bit short for me on the merit of sourcing. It doesn't explain how it will attract people to come and be on the show.
21.  There is just an e-mail posted but that's it. I don't see any strategy element to how to drive interest anywhere in this proposal.
22.  I assume that's an easy add-on but it should be outlined in the proposal. Otherwise - it is too free of a concept not grounded in a methodology that can then deliver on the measurable metrics - which then brings me to later point in another grading segment mentioned.""

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  
2.  Showcase community projects, followed by a Q&A session between the contributor and the audience. Highlighting the challenges these projects face as well as the value they deliver to the community, would encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
3.  ""Youtube channels and podcasts are a great way to get information to other people and to help get information to new users that may have just found Cardano.
4.  With that said, I need to grade this proposal strictly on the criteria given. Does this proposal, """"... encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"""". The answer is, I don't know… Two of the questions that need to be answered in this section are, """"How many developers were encouraged to build on Cardano?"""", and """"How many entrepreneurs were encouraged to build on Cardano?"""" This is where my issue with youtube channels and podcasts come from… How can we answer these questions? I did not see any ideas in the author's proposal about how to measure the number of developers or entrepreneurs the podcast will create. How are you going to know if you brought in anyone? Maybe you can poll your viewers? IDK... There is really nothing in this proposal about developers or entrepreneurs. The only place they are mentioned is in the author's definitions about what applies to him. I would have to give you a (3 - Neither agree or disagree) because there is just no information one way or the other in the proposal.""
5.  Details shared simply and effectively
6.  Proposal is genuine and FULLY committed to Cardano and the future. There is no doubt in my mind that this team will succeed in their goals for this proposal.
7.  Bigpey, through his YouTube channel has demonstrated his commitment to informing and helping the community through product updates. His timely updates leaves little doubt that his proposal will be implemented successfully.
8.  ""The proposer's long standing channel provides evidence that successful implementation is likely. What is missing in the proposal is any metrics by which success is to be measured.
9.  There are no targets established for the number of developers and businesses that will be featured.
10.  There are no targets for the number of shows that will be done over any specific timeframe.
11.  In the absence of specific success metrics, there can be no measure of success.""
12.  For experience of the last videos it is very likely that this project will be a success
13.  Has a great following and well thought out plan to action.
14.  The proposer currently has a Youtube channel where they are conducting interviews and providing informative content, however, this has the potential to be in direct conflict with IOHK's investment in the creator of video content on David Likes Crypto Youtube Channel.
15.  The proposer has relevant experience, is a true individual voice and ""stakeholder"" in many senses of the word in the Cardano ecosystem. Will running a stakepool and several podcasts be feasible - at the same time, wasn't able to judge whether a lack of team will be a hindrance.
16.  This proposal can be implemented successfully because you have been doing it for a long time and have experience. But I think the funds would be better invested in proposals that really meet the needs of the challenge fund2.
17.  No doubt that a podcast could be made.
18.  While I have little doubt that the podcast episodes would be released, I have my doubts as to if the caliber would be high enough to onboard new users and developers. Some of the interviewees are good, but I feel like you aren't experienced enough as a developer to know some of the best questions to ask for developers nor are experienced enough with other cryptocurrencies to be able to formalize good arguments for switching to or joining the Cardano community.
19.  Peyton is one of Cardano's most popular content creators and already has many months of experience on YouTube, so he has enough experience to make the proposal come true, but I was unable to assess the need for 150,000 ADAs in the budget, as no details were given on how the budget will be spent.
20.  Yes, we have some nice POC but i don't see any clear time frame to deliver this contents, i also don't see any risk assessment, what will be made with the funds for the next 6 months if we don't have all episodes addressing projects? A breaking down in costs would be good.
21.  It would simply be a continuatiin of ongoing efforts

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  
2.  Clearly high quality content as demonstrated by test videos already delivered.
3.  ""I have every effort to believe that this would be seem through with degree of success. This is especially true due to the name associated with the proposal.
4.  I would have liked to learn a bit more on a professional side of things for those who never met Peyton - maybe some additional references, etc. To avoid - that's just the dude from youtube sort of thing. Which isn't bad but...it seems the proposal is banking heavily on the known factor.
5.  To return back to the original thought - we are now unable to measure any progress because no benchmarking metrics have been established as mentioned in the next section.""
6.  The proposer would continue producing videos for their YouTube channel. Project Catalyst would mean more projects would be developed and could use a voice.
7.  The author seems to have a few youtube channels so I see no reason why the podcast would not be successful as a podcast… I think the implementation should go fine. The author, although seeming to be still learning, should be fully capable of pulling off what he is talking about doing. I am going to give you a (4 - agree) because I still don't see how it is going to bring in developers… or at least be able to prove any developers were brought in..
8.  Proofs in the pudding great examples
9.  I feel that it is pretty hard to personally asses feasibility of your own project, especially taking into account timing and where Cardano currently is on the Road map. That being said, I feel the proposal does provide sufficient information for others to assess its feasibility its effectiveness to address the challenges that it wants to tackle, if voters actually research the information provided.
10.  YouTube quantitative figures have been provided and coupled with the frequent positive comments received, does support the effectiveness of your podcast in helping the Cardano ecosystem grow. As such, I believe your podcasts could play a hand in encouraging others to build on Cardano and to a certain extent succeed in addressing the challenge. It would have been nice to see some qualitative information such as references in your proposal such as specific examples of how you have brought in new community members.
11.  Peyton is an important member of the Cardano community. That said YouTube has its own set of incentives and compelling content should be sustainable in and of itself. What this proposal lacking is clear metrics to demonstrate it is achieving the goals of this fund2 challenge. Fund2 is dedicated to expanding the ecosystem. Right now cardano is generating interest and engagement in and of itself so this proposal does not demonstrate how it is creating unique value within the cardano ecosystem.
12.  The proposer provides a good explanation of what will be done, but not how often. There is no information about how participants will be attracted to be on the podcast. The proposer has a good name in the community, which indicates the feasibility of success. It would be good to provide a solid roadmap with metrics to measure.
13.  We have to take in consideration that your videos also contain personal advertisements to your own Stakepool. So, IMHO your videos should not contain private advertisements
14.  Feasible but does not address challenge.
15.  The proposer clearly outlines how their mission aligns with that of the current challenge and what they are trying to solve. It is unclear where the requested funds will be directed.
16.  Providing a platform for developers and entrepreneurs is a worthy approach. However, the lack of a platform for communication may not be the biggest challenge of Fund2 and a new Podcast may not be the best option out there.
17.  ""
18.  Although metrics can be used on how many videos were made and how many people interacted with them. It is not presented as evaluating how many entrepreneurs and developers joined Cardano thanks to this proposal.""
19.  How much info does it need to assess how feasible it is to deliver a podcast (especially when quality is not in the equation). It still completely fails to explain how this is attracting developers to cardano.
20.  I didn't find the definition of success of the established proposal clear enough, since the only metrics suggested for success evaluation would be the monthly analytics data of the channel on YouTube, which does not have a significant relationship with the challenge of fund2, as these analytics would only indicate general information about the channel's audience.
21.  I was not able to find information to give assess in how feasible it is. What will be the KPI, how will be measured that this episodes attracted a new developer and entrepreneur? How this can be measured and how we will be able to assess this in the future?
22.  Very little to add, and charts kf previous value are useful m
23.  Off topic for Fund 2, but well executed.
24.  ""This proposal does not make reasonable effort in showcases the business side of the proposal itself.
25.  It only mentions one grand figure but there is no additional dept/detail made available that can help us understand better how the funds are going to be allocated, etc.
26.  Even if it were to be simply - I need to invest into doing this this time amount which translates into this dollar/ada figure. At the moment - it simply seems to match CH public call for action - which doesn't sound unreasonable by default - but doesn't really take time to explain how to audit effect of these funds.
27.  Further, there are no KPIs established. Two screenshots of recent video metrics are attached. Unfortunately, these are not anchored in the proposal itself against values that we can measure/benchmark once the time comes down the road.
28.  It is unfortunate, because it has a great potential - but the proposal hasn't been put work into that it deserves for the amount of funds requested. Unable to establish accountability.""
29.  The proposal includes a cle...",NO
04/Nov/20 1:11 PM,322230,1470,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  The proposer is suggesting to hire/engage developers in order to create a marketing platform with a not-for-profit characteristic where charities will be able to raise money for their causes. Half of the marketing profits will be allocated to a Charity Pool from which distribution will occur. The proposer does not specify how this project will channel the marketing proceeds in order to attract future developers to Cardano specifically.
2.  I do not see how selling ads on a separated platform with a custom token integrated will help in getting developers to start making dApps on Cardano.
3.  This challenge is about making the platform itself attractive to developers and not writing dapps that just happen to be in the cardano eco system.
4.  It can definitely serve as an example of what is possible ontop of future versions of Cardano
5.  I spend a bit of time in this proposal, its hard to back private implementations that not even offer an opensource output. What will be the output of this proposal that others developers will be able to use after this project is finished? I was not able to see.
6.  Does not directly address the challenge, especially within the 6 month timeframe
7.  Off topic for Fund 2, but an interesting proposal. Recommend resubmission in later funding rounds.
8.  ""Not entirely convinced on the claim of the proposal that it makes sufficient effort to meet the proposal focus and dFund2 theme challenge under:
9.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
10.  I understand that the reasoning is to employ these existing developers to build dApp on the platform. But I don't see immediate effects on a broader scale of things.
11.  Because by that logic - this project is already attracted to build on Cardano - but how does it push that attraction beyond its immediate surroundings. That - doesn't seem to be addressed in good detail.
12.  I can assume what that could be - but proposal should make that distinction clear right away. Missing that component at the moment.""

  

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  
2.  A dapp where businesses advertise to audiences supporting a cause through nonprofit channels.
3.  Nicely presented
4.  The proposer claims to have 10 years of experience in marketing and non-profit fundraising. They are stating to be currently collaborating with the ABCD team, who have several proposals of their own on the Ideascale Fund2 Challenge.
5.  The grand scope of the proposal makes it hard to assess.
6.  The proposal unfortunately relies on unreleased (as of 2020-10-25 Cardano features
7.  Again, the milestones are very broad, and we dont know it the money request is for all project, only for the smart contract side? The project is already backed for other venture so i believe part of this roadmap is done, but there is no distinction in this proposal. What happens with the implementation?
8.  The amount of ADA requested in the proposal will not give enough runway for the project,
9.  It is a credible and well thought out plan.
10.  Given the relative uncertainty in several issues within the proposal - I don't have full confidence in provided proposal. I believe it has good merits but it needs more accountability and stronger alignment with the dFund goal beyond the basics. I like it - just can't wrap my head peacefully around it yet. Proposal should be able to convey that message quite rapidly. It just doesn't invoke that in me presently as hinted per other observations.
11.  The proposer has marketing and fundraising experience. They will engage development work, and has tentative partners.
12.  Funding could be a issue this round
13.  In the long term, this could be beneficial to Cardano brand image, however, this proposal's main goal is to target an issue that is outside of the Fund2 Challenge.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  Repeating 500 billion dollars that are spend yearly on advertising is no proper explanation about any outcome of this proposal.
2.  It sounds unrealistic and even if possible, has very little to do with cardano itself or the fund2 challenge.
3.  The authors don't seem to be aware enough of the challenges and limitations waiting for them ahead of their proposal.
4.  I agree that we have some information but lead me to some other questions. In respect to the challenge i don't know if its possible to improve.
5.  A great idea however does not meet the challenge objective.
6.  The proposal demonstrates the feasibility well, but ultimately has no alignment with Fund 2 goals.
7.  ""There are some general doubts with regards to accountability. Information provided suggests major portion of funds to be distributed further. I am unsure how we can maintain that accountability with another set of actors separated with the primary objective.
8.  But then there is the question about licensing. From the language used - I am unclear what the IP/licensing would be like clearly - basically - what is the Cardano community going to get in return for the funds invested. I read a lot of general statements but it is difficult to ground it down to measurable accounts.
9.  One of the reasons being - there aren't any performance metrics included that would help us guide. Especially, going beyond three development goals listed - is the creation of them the only thing we monitor? What about wider impact? Involvement? Unable to determine that from the information provided.""
10.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, and credentials.

04/Nov/20 1:06 PM,322218,1462,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Adoption can only be hampered by access we need every bridge possible
2.  The proposer offers to create a tool in order to interact between SWIFT API and Cardano. This could be beneficial to developers proficient in SWIFT systems who are interested in creating on Cardano.
3.  A direct proposal for a specific tool that is valid and needed in the direction to fullfil the challange goals.
4.  Creating tools for developers is at the core of the challenge. It should even come before actually trying to attract developers.
5.  Providing an SDK under MIT license is directly relevant to Fund 2. The plan to wrap the Rust library (initially) seems practical, but might look bad to developers... who could just use the Rust library.
6.  ""Beyond the immediate basics of benefits that could stem from the technical aspect of the proposal - it does not go that needed mile to establish clear relevancy to the question posed in the dFund2 theme:
7.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""
8.  I would have expected this to be answered rather easily but for some reason it isn't given a thought in any part of the proposal. Unsure why that is the case.""
9.  This will directly make it easier for new developers to build on Cardano
10.  Cardano Swift SDK could encourage developers to build on Cardano.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Funding may be a issue this round
2.  Would you mind elaborating further what the plan actually entails?
3.  The proposer has blockchain development experience and claims to have started on the proposal. This will also be an open source project, which can attract interested parties willing to participate.
4.  This should be within reach of the current team.
5.  The team seams to have already proven to be able to deliver, only the time frame is not clear.
6.  There are no details on the implementation team, their background or skillsets. The linked github repo as very shallow and has only a basically empty 'pool' repo beside it... the proposal could have been considerably enhanced with links to verify claims and statements made by the team.
7.  ""Github is a good source of information - but otherwise I am lacking any attempt to establish a real person credibility. There are two references to the stake pool operations but that's about it.
8.  It would be useful to establish real life personas to know who actually would be receiving funds. That would help us also establish accountability better and hence likelihood of implementation better. ""

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  Relevant experience, but the plan is lacking details
2.  The proposal could discuss how the project would be maintained after Fund 2.
3.  "" KXP
4.  Free Plug.... enthusiasm.... is infectious ""
5.  The proposal does not include a breakdown of the timeline nor budget detail. Rough estimates are March 2021 and 100k ADA. It is unclear if this is a team or a solo project.
6.  This seems like a correct and straight forward endeavor.
7.  They don't spend time on elaborating about the feasibility, but given the funds asked this is good proposal.
8.  ""Seems like a decent idea, but we have no way to judge if this is the right time to pursue it.
9.  Perhaps consider re-submission of a more polished proposal in later rounds if the problem remains?""
10.  ""It lacks appropriate level of depth and detail with regards to their budgetary requirements and timeline associated with that.
11.  Also, it does not mention any actionable metrics that would enable the community to effectively track progress/define success in real terms.
12.  There is only mention of being ready by March 2021 and one grand total figure to be requested for funding.""
13.  The proposal is lacking details on what will be delivered.
14.  The proposal would benefit significantly from traction with other developers and users.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Being a dApp itself; it can serve as a valid and valueable example for the mission of the challenge.
2.  This has no lifting effect for the ecosystem and is not attracting developers.
3.  I cant agree that this proposal addresses the challenge, its a interesting proposal and need more refinement in order our community understand the real outcome of this implementation.
4.  the fund requested exceeds what's available in Fund2 and it is not explained how this benefits the Cardano community
5.  As stated by Dor Garbash in the weekly Town Hall on 7/10/2020, proposals that exceed the budget will be automatically rejected. This proposal exceeds the budget by 380 000 ADAs, so there is no need for further evaluation.
6.  ""Unable to determine the firm link between the scope of the proposal and the dFund2 theme challenge:
7.  """"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""""
8.  Its a dapp not directly an onramp
9.  Mostly off topic for Fund 2, but I gave a small score bump to 2/5 given the long term appeal possible in an app ecosystem... but it is extremely niche and far from current mainstream use cases for blockchain tech. Seems unrealistic that it would draw developers within 6 months.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Mental health dapp where users can share and monetize their own data.
2.  The right connections with the appropriate cardano developers can adapt the existing tool to work on Cardano
3.  The team looks competent for the task presented.
4.  We lack a clear plan of what will be specifically proposed and addressed, roadmap and costs associated to each milestone.
5.  No proof of concept was presented, and no examples of similar blockchain projects performed by this team
6.  As stated by Dor Garbash in the weekly Town Hall on 7/10/2020, proposals that exceed the budget will be automatically rejected. This proposal exceeds the budget by 380 000 ADAs, so there is no need for further evaluation.
7.  ""It seems that the team assembled is suited to take this over to the finish line.
8.  However, as hinted above - unsure how that fits into the scope of the current funding challenge. ""
9.  The idea is good and has a solid academical background.
10.  There is little detail in the presented 'plan' which outlines what would be delivered or how the funds would be used.
11.  The budget is larger than Fund 2.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

1.  No particular infromation is given, and the proposal feels more like a handout to further develop their own application.
2.  The challenge is not addressed at all.
3.  The execution and deliverable are not clear, it definitely don't addresses the challenge in the next 6 months.
4.  There's multiple apps available in this field and the feasibility of one more application on the blockchain cannot be proven based on the information provided
5.  As stated by Dor Garbash in the weekly Town Hall on 7/10/2020, proposals that exceed the budget will be automatically rejected. This proposal exceeds the budget by 380 000 ADAs, so there is no need for further evaluation.
6.  ""The budgetary requirements requested and then the lack of actionable allocations makes me question the purpose of this proposal.
7.  I tried to find it in the extensive slide deck but nowhere to be found what the funds are going to be allocated to for. It shouldn't be that difficult to figure it out.
8.  it reads like an equity investment deck more than a proposal streamlined for a seed round like this dFund2. ""
9.  The proposal is not tailored to the Challenge and asks for too much Ada.
10.  Very glossy proposal and it seems like a well resourced team, but ultimately comes off heavy on marketing and sales with no tech details.
11.  Business idea could be validated first.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Im 100% sure that all from this team can be implemented.
2.  The proposers have built tooling to help stake pool operators manage their pools.
3.  Lets see what you can do
4.  I'm sure they will discover more challenge if they begin develop CNTools as implied by the ""..."" at the end of the list.
5.  At first the System parameters should be set to values in a way that every SPO, indipendent of what is being delegated gets a fair reqard for the work being done
6.  Low cost of entry with ~6 months timeline.
7.  The proposal claims to streamline the SPO network in order to create a stable environment and ecosystem for developers.
8.  There is adequate evidence for the desired purpose.
9.  It is not addressing the challenge. Stake pool operators are not developers.
10.  Seems feasible. The proposal is well detailed but the breakdown of the number of hours per task is not.
11.  Proposal takes an effort to establish pricing per hour of the proposed sum.
12.  However, each development piece of the project has no time element associated to it to really understand time commitment needed to implement different tools.
13.  There is also missing a timeline element that would map the proposed tools onto there as well as general roadmap. There is only a to do list of desired items, grand time and grand total. But it gives me no confidence to understand substance behind this information.
14.  Lastly, benchmarking metrics are unavailable as it only states:
15.  ""Contributions, activity, and continued development can be tracked through the public GitHub repository.""
16.  Would be better to say - weekly/monthly target it this and that, etc.
17.  Feasible proposal, but not in alignment with Fund 2 goals.
18.  I was not able to find in the proposal any KPI or metrics for developers acquisition or entrepreneurs, not even an clear strategy.
19.  There is no roadmap. There is no definition of deadlines in the goals / milestones.
20.  There are no described metrics to prove the impact of this project on fund2. How to measure / evaluate the impact if solid data are not presented?
21.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, credentials, and success metrics.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Seems they know what tools they need as SPO's.
2.  The proposal claims to indirectly benefit future development growth by streamlining the current SPO network.
3.  I don't see a strong enough connection between more tools for SPOs and further adoption of Cardano. If anything I would have liked to reveneu streams for SPOs or some other feature.
4.  This is needed though and valueable work, just undirected.
5.  The proposal has very little impact on attracting developers.
6.  This project doesn't seem to be completely in line with Fund2 challenge
7.  SPOs are an essential part of the ecosystem and thus they need good tools maintain their Businesses.
8.  Proposal makes insufficient effort to make the clear connections between its scope and dFund2 challenge that reads:
9.  ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""
10.  It only tries to do that in reverse claiming""
11.  ""An unhealthy network with reduced performance due to stake pool issues could discourage onboarding and developers from building on Cardano.""
12.  Which seems rather an indirect connection that an active component that developers would be actively pursuing looking from outside in. The health of the network is a basic expectation of the network performance by default.
13.  Hence, unable to see greater meaning on the dFund theme challenge.
14.  Off topic for Fund 2.
15.  The propose is to create services and tools to improve configuration and management of pools which will prevent chain density degradation. The argument that improvements in the structure of pools and blockchain in general will bring developers and entrepreneurs to Cardano is subjective, how to measure the impact in this case? I recognize that a stable environment for SPOs is positive, but we need some concrete data to make a decision.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  Im not sure how this can help developers and entrepreneurs in the next six months, CNTools ie a great tool and no doubt they help a lot the ecosystem.
2.  Tooling for stake pool operators encourages both development and businesses on Cardano.
3.  The fact that this is actively being worked on
4.  Version 1 of anything is not perfect so 4 of 5.
5.  Relevant experience present that aligns with the proposal's main goal. Timeline and budget break down presented.
6.  The proposition seems like a direct continuation of current and past efforts so this should work out perfectly well.
7.  The proposal looks to be realistic in that time frame, given the relevant experience.
8.  Yes qualified developer with the experience needed to achieve the goals of this project
9.  There already is a working Product, thus it is likely that the development will continue.
10.  Based on the profile of the proposal owner now - it is very likely that this project will get through. Unfortunately, this is based on my insider information only.
11.  For a wider audience, this proposal does not establish with degree of confidence the identity of the owner. Would have been easily fixed with a LinkedIn profile or additional references provided. It is difficult to match that with forum nicknames, etc. Much less for someone who isn't member of community on an intimate level.
12.  Plan could be better presented, but the team has background in this space, which lends confidence.
13.  The proposer has been an SPO since 2019 and has already created tools and scripts, his experience is relevant to the proposal.
14.  The budget was set based on the salary of $ 45 / h and the entire budget will be allocated to the proposer's salary during the 6 months of project development.
15.  No roadmap and deadlines have been defined. No KPIs have been defined.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Africa is a big target and hard to address the challenges without in depth knowledge beyond what is explained here, but good luck as I support it.
2.  ABCD is a solid proposal which addresses the challenge by training 15 developers in Africa in Haskell, Plutus and Marlowe in order to develop Dapps. With the attention and opportunity it provides to the African community, I believe it also falls in line with one of the core aims of Cardano. It has a well thought out evaluation plan with quantifiable metrics for evaluating ROI ranging from number of Dapps developed to partnerships created.
3.  The proposal offers to provide individuals with the education and skills required to excel within the Cardano ecosystem. ABCD's vision aligns with that of IOHK and they claim to already have started cooperation with the organization.
4.  The ABCD Center is a direct answer to the challenge
5.  The proposal is very interesting. And it aims to add developers and entrepreneurs. Although it is not clear to me if the team in charge of training new developers has experience in what they intend to teach.
6.  Building the infrastructure for developer training is the core of the fund2 challenge.
7.  This is an exciting proposal that can make a real impact in the area. I would score it higher if it wasn't so niche, but it is hard to see how that could be achieved with a 'bricks and mortar' approach.
8.  If the initial stages show promising returns this could be fantastic.
9.  Spot on!
10.  One of the very few proposals that takes the dFund2 challenge to the merit it deserves.
11.  ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""
12.  The scope and the theme is clear and it would be a fantastic opportunity to see this actually grow up into something bigger. If this works out - it would make for a good lighthouse opportunity in the region.
13.  Bootstrap an education centre that would provide Cardano training and business support.
14.  I am on the fence as I am not familiar if there are better opportunities for folks down the road with the leaps in technology happening nowadays is blockchain developer the right way?
15.  Sensible planning with details has been presented which certainly adds to the feasibility of this proposal. I do however question the amount of relevant experience as running a stakepool, organising events and creating guides is quite different to running a center. Nevertheless, Joshua Akpan's contribution to Cardano and the community has been outstanding. As such, I am cautiously optimistic that the proposal will be implemented successfully given his and ABCD's level of commitment to the development of Cardano.
16.  The team claims to have experience with outreach and marketing to the target audience (see Roadmap Phase1 note), this should allow for easier implementation of their long term vision.
17.  It is an ambitious further step from current efforts, but within reason.
18.  By detailing their expenses, plans, experience, and current alliances they indirectly address how they might attack unexpected situations.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  ABCD have a clear plan and it would be good to see it carried out. Adding expert trainers on Marlowe, Plutus, Haskell and more.
2.  The scope of the project might be to big and there is no real experience.
3.  To me the biggest issue is how this business has been started, there is no other partner to split the cost of the facility, but this is not the biggest problem. To me the problem is a developer cost that already starts with 15 developers ($45k/month) that need to learn haskell. At this point is a brute force on money, i prefer start training 5 and build more sustainable relationships to other projects and allocating new developers after they pass in the haskell training. There is no evaluation process around this too.
4.  It is clear that a lot of planning and effort has gone into this idea and there is a substantial amount of community building in the various communication channels linked.
5.  Not a lot of 'professional expertise' has been noted in the proposal, but there is sufficient depth of content that it seems a worthwhile risk for the treasury to explore an initial investment and let the team prove themselves.
6.  There are a few uncertainties but the overall plan seems solid.
7.  I have every reason to believe this would be seen through. However, it is a huge project by all means.
8.  Hence, establishing clearly who the team behind ADCD is individually would go a long way. One cannot assume that every person who would vote for project is intimately known and aware of individuals, ambassadors, etc. Hence, it would be helpful to include those profiles here one by one to establish credibility. As I mentioned - this is a huge project that goes beyond SPO operations as such. It is a real business that will impact real lives and needs to be approached that way.
9.  Also, your attached document still has label 'Draft' - does it mean it is not reliable? Just a detail but would be good to clean up eventually to get best message across as possible.
10.  The proposers have a team, a detailed proposal with a cost breakdown and future plans.
11.  This looks very ambitious and I find it impossible to gauge the feasibility at this point. I like the phased approach.
12.  Well presented.
13.  A wonderfully detailed cost breakdown provided where possible with proposed activity reports and evaluation plan. The proposed updates will undoubtedly provide the community with encouraging insights into the training centre which in turn will reaffirm the positive direction the Cardano Ecosystem is headed. Although you have ""taken the estimates of for projected years of sustainability"" out of the equation for Fund2, given the scope of the project, it would have been good to see a more detailed discussion on the long term self-sustainability of the center moving from fully to partially and beyond funding.
14.  High cost of execution. Need to review several other ways to achieve the same goal with higher efficiency.
15.  Yes. there is a clear section describing how it will benefit all stakeholders in play.
16.  ABCD have presented a lot of useful information. It only remains to know the exact metrics to evaluate progress.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  The use of the funds is transparent. The action plan is well presented, but may be to optimistic.
2.  We have nice information and this proposal addresses the challenge but i would like to see improvements in the feasibility steps
3.  Plenty of detail noted in the proposal about how the team expects to proceed and the developers they expect to engage with.
4.  There are sufficient information to asses this proposal. Also the cooperation with the other Cardano bodies is reassuring.
5.  Great wealth of information provided. A bit challenging to read all of it - would suggest - for the next round to tier the proposal into split formats. One for the current period of funding required - into the proposal text - and then the larger road map as a .pdf so that one can separate the immediate needs beyond detailed long-term. Might help digest information a bit better.
6.  One other major thing I am missing - unsure to find metrics that would help us determine the success of the project. What the goals are.
7.  E.g. - in January we plan to have this output. By March 2021 - that output. Defining these in greater detail would enable community to benchmark information more effectively. I tried to look over the proposal multiple times but I haven't found that just yet - so my apologies if it is somewhere.
8.  Reports will be published every trimester; updates every 6 weeks.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Why are videos the right format to deliver this type of content?
2.  Education is hard to get right on the first edition.
3.  Directly trying to onboard new developers by teaching interested people how to develop on Cardano for free.
4.  I do not want to turn down this project, but it is too soon. Plutus and Marlow are still in development and this fund does not have enough capital to such a large project.
5.  Proposer addresses the challenge by offering to provide educational content to entry-level developers on Haskell/Plutus/Marlowe.
6.  Absolutely agree that Haskell is initially a barrier to entry for our Fund2 Challenge of onboarding as many developers as possible. Training courses, particularly for Marlowe first, then Plutus, should help spread knowledge quickly even making the non-dev population interested and engaged.
7.  Very creative project with a combined benefit of learning the tools used by cardano itself.
8.  Content to guide developers in learning to write Plutus and Haskell code perfectly addresses the challenge.
9.  Yes we need more content educating developers and this proposal address the challenge.
10.  Its on point!
11.  Clear connection to the dFund2 theme with specific roadmap items that bridge the gap of proposal's scope and dFund2 theme. One of few proposals that enables doing that clearly.
12.  Educational material focused specifically on developers is perfect for Fund 2.
13.  I just wanted to start out by saying that this is a really good idea and needed. I think there is a misconception that learning Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe is as simple as learning solidity was with Ethereum. It is not. Haskell (what the other two languages are based on) is not a simple language. You are not able to say, ""If you know python or javascript, Haskell is easy to learn"". Haskell is a completely different kind of programming (functional) then what most people know and/or familiar with. We need something like this.
14.  With that said, I need to grade this proposal strictly on the criteria given. Does this proposal, ""... encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"". I believe the answer to this question is yes. You are literally creating Cardano developers by teaching them. As you say, ""In 2019, Haskell accounted for just 0.39% of all active users code on GitHub."" There is a large need for Haskell developers and, in turn, Cardano developers. You also explain, ""This is probably because Haskell is considered a hard language to learn and its popularity is low as most devs today are used to imperative Object-Oriented Programming languages than functional languages such as Haskell."" This shows that not only do we need to attract current Haskell developers but we also need to create Haskell (Plutus, Marlowe) developers.
15.  When I look at the question and ask myself if this project effectively addresses the challenge, I have to say yes. The next question is how much does it address the challenge? I am going to give this proposal a (5 - Strongly agree). I graded it as high as I could because, more than other languages, we need to create Haskell developers. It is not enough to just pull over current developers. As noted above, Haskell accounts for only 0.39% of active users on github… We need to create more developers.
16.  Educational content for Plutus/Marlowe would make it easier for developers to join the Cardano ecosystem.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  Given that you already created a number of videos I am confident that you will be able to do what you outlined.
2.  Outline appears done so should not be too hard to succeed from here.
3.  The plan is well thought out and explained in detail which would make the job a lot easier for auditors. The proposer says himself that he is a beginner and by no means an expert developer. However, he does have a YouTube channel with Cardano themed videos so there is, at least, some experience with video creation, editing, public speaking etc.
4.  Too soon to tell if this project will be a success or not. It is just too soon
5.  The content creator is not proficient in the programming languages mentioned, they will need outside aid in order to successfully continue on as the difficulty level increases. Their educational content quality will depend on their own progress within the topic of discussion.
6.  Yes, proposer has experience in programming in Haskell albeit only for a few months, but judging by his previous content on similar learning sessions and the quality of his work, I'd be confident in him that this proposal is implemented. Also his costs and contingency plans so he's overly prepared with what this endeavor will take to complete and potential roadblocks he may hit.
7.  His current experience is optimal to finishing the project.
8.  The scope of the project is to big for a single, unexperienced person. Those guides need to be of excellent quality and highly polished.
9.  Yes the plan is clear and simple.
10.  The proposer seem capable and already has some experience. My main distrust comes from the fact that the proposer is not an experienced Haskell Dev and probably underestimates the complexity.
11.  I have some concerns about ability to translate the educational content to the wider audience based on lack of education in this language.
12.  I assume this can be overcome but I don't have yet a firm understanding how this will be overcome to potential viewers. This would could mean - to learn haskell inside out first and then start teaching others - especially due to best practices, etc.
13.  But I have confidence it should be doable.
14.  Also - more references would be beneficial to understand the proposal owner, too. As github page does not have much activity historically.
15.  Demonstrated body of prior work on Youtube with community engagement
16.  Is it highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully? I also believe the answer to this is yes. The author is not only knowledgeable but he seems to also be honest. I have watched some of his videos on stake pools and they are very detailed and he obviously knows what he is doing. He also admitted, ""I am a beginner in Haskell - I only started learning a few months ago because Cardano is built on Haskell. My idea is to create the content as I learn new things myself - I am by no means a Haskell expert.""
17.  I have no doubt based on the videos I watched, his overall github channel, and the detailed way he laid out his plan that he is more than capable of learining Haskell and implementing this proposal successfully. I am also giving him a (5 - Strongly agree). I am giving him the best score because he was already helping people for free (with his stake pool videos) before he created this proposal. It shows that he will follow through on the implementation.
18.  The proposer is a Haskell beginner which could help with creating beginner-friendly content. They have content creation experience.
19.  Technology education is a moving target with features, fixes, and releases. Hopefully they address this challenge as well.
20.  Plenty of material inside the proposal about this, detailed plan, cost breakdown, even curriculum breakdown.
21.  The information presented gives me the impression that it is also a learning project for the proposer himself. He should come back in funds 10 or so and present his plans again
22.  All funds are requested in USD and not ADA. No clear timeline provided or if they will require further funds to continue their work. This proposal targets entry-level Haskell/Plutus/Marlowe developers.
23.  Yes, risks are clearly highlighted and backup plans detailed as to what steps will be taken should roadblocks be hit. Contingency funds accounted for as well in case timing is more than anticipated.
24.  Relevant Material, Experience, and Risk Assessment is adecuate.
25.  The proposal makes it sufficiently clear that the task is not feasible - how should I vote here?
26.  How effective will be based on auditability but this project have not put enough in metrics for it to measure the effectivity.
27.  This proposal has all information needed to assess, we just need some better metrics and KPIs.
28.  I would have liked to see a PoConcept for the Haskell videos.
29.  Good budget break down.
30.  However, I a missing accountable benchmarking metrics. There is a good attempt to verbally describe what these are - but it falls short establishing actual values. Otherwise, we don't know how we define success. Meaning - viewership? Likes? Shares? If so - how many of each is a good target - impressions, etc. These need to be bolted down otherwise we are floating without anchor.
31.  Costs are justified and well reasoned and the proposal strongly aligns with Fund 2 goals.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  There are two questions here:
2.  Does this proposal provide sufficient information to assess how feasible the project is?
3.  Yes, This proposal is laid out with all the information and information is also given based on results that are less than optimum or unlikely to happen. This is a well thought out proposal that tries to take into account all possible outcomes.
4.  For example, he lists risks:
5.  ""\*\*RISKS\*\*
6.  In case the time required to create the content turns out to be significantly higher than estimated, the contingency funds will cover additional work time
7.  If a family or another type of crisis happens and I don't have as much time as I thought - depending on the crisis level, the work could either be frozen for a short time or the remaining funding could be returned
8.  If the project turns out to be more complicated than expected, it is possible to break it up into chunks and focus on a chunked part to ensure that it is delivered while the rest is put on hold""
9.  How effectively does it address the challenge?
10.  It very effectively addresses the challenge in my opinion. As said above, we need Haskell developers and we cannot depend only on current Haskell developers. The Haskell community is not currently large enough to just move other developers over to Haskell. We need to create new Haskell developers. It is not just a good idea to create new Haskell developers. It is imperative that we create new Haskell developers. This project does just that and I believe the author is the right person to tackle the challenge. I am also giving him a (5 - Strongly agree) for this section. The reason I am giving him the highest score for this last section is that this project directly addresses the issue of bringing creators into Cardano… in fact, it goes a step further. It creates developers.
11.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, credentials, and success metrics.

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

1.  Since both initial services are already working, what is needed is content and evolution, and begin working on additional components. Even without extra funds this is already a reality, but funding will drastically accelerate its complete implementation and provide real tangible value to the community.
2.  Impressive ""Team: BIOS"" with years of experience in education, development and marketing, relevant to this proposal. Prior commitment and development since the start of Fund 1 has been well received and valued by the community. Together with a clear framework and working MVP's, the team appears well positioned to make their Fund 2 proposal a success.
3.  The experience seams to be exactly what is needed to turn this into a success.
4.  Yes the plan is very clear and we already have some POC, planing and KPIs are great.
5.  first two starter kits demonstrate ability to deliver high quality CSK, team has a good makeup of experience required.
6.  The implementer is already committed, the proposal will seemingly be implemented, however the successfulness will hinge on the experience and talent of the team - and it is not easily measurable yet.
7.  A few starter kit have already been provided a list of upcoming starter kit would have been nice to have.
8.  I see a very strong team behind, that has already gained experience during fund 1 and is highly motivated to continue its path. The team has outlined detailed goals, milestones, activities and roadmaps. Furthermore, risks and challenges are addresses and possible mitigation is described. A slight risk can be in the availability of resources (time), since all key-players of the team do also have other assignments. Also for coping with this concern, the team has outlined a hiring-plan along the road. Overall: Very professional appearance.
9.  Starter kits are already being released and look like a good entry program for non-techs. The background for the team behind the API is also very promising (former Emurgo) with a plan to release not just useful APIs to the public, but also open source 'recipes' for running the APIs as part of private solutions.
10.  I am not sure how well the actual coding will be taught, but I am sure the team will have a good solution.
11.  I like the profiles of people involved that give me good confidence in being able to carry out the work load. It is not a small feat.
12.  To better establish team credibility - including professional work profiles of people involved would be great. I have to rely on the information presented in document itself - external references would have been really helpful.
13.  The proposers have the relevant education, development, and marketing background. The plan is detailed and has a cost breakdown.
14.  the Funding request for round 2 is bit high
15.  It is not that you would start with nothing. Valuable resources are already out there. Can you elaborate what specifically you would like to add?

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

1.  The strengths found in this team are well suited for a successful implementation. This multi-path approach allows for continued work beyond the scope of this Fund2 Proposal by attracting funding from outside of the Catalyst Project. Each Path has KPI and success metrics, which are reasonable and achievable.
2.  All the team members have extensive experience in their fields. The plan is detailed and well thought out. The quality of the already published materials is quite good and beginner friendly.
3.  Seems this team knows what to do and can succeed.
4.  The success metrics are well laid out and provide easy to measure KPI. This shows that the team has considered what success looks like. They have articulated what they intend to accomplish and how they will accomplish it.
5.  The project provides a detailed breakdown of cost, both personnel and infrastructure costs. KPIs are clearly defined. A detailed roadmap is provided which lists the project's current and future goals.
6.  They have presented multiple details and metrics. Which allows me to say that the proposal has managed to meet the objectives of fund2.
7.  Al information is clear and well organized
8.  The proposal is fully aligned with the current Fund2 Challenge and satisfies its target issue.
9.  referred existing material makes things more than clear.
10.  Plans and materials are clear and highly detailed.
11.  The team's understanding of the problem, solution and comprehensive information provided, made the assessment of the feasibility of this project a top contender for me in Fund 2. A clear roadmap with milestones and measurements along the way provides focus and attention towards the final goal. The measurements of success are clear, however, I do feel the bar could be lifted a touch higher. I would have also liked to see additional consideration / measurement towards the final assessment of the impact of this project, which could provide an indication of the effectiveness and level of demand for further development.
12.  According to the circumstances, the plan for the implementation is very understandable and comprehensible.
13.  Yes, this proposal provided a PDF with all information included, costs are clear and the team partnership helped to deliver a more robust proposal.
14.  yes detailed proposal attached provides good level of details for the project, value prop, detailed road map, and team bios. I also like the inclusion of KPI to evaluate success
15.  I agree that there is enough information about the feasibility, although the issue of quality of output remains an important issue.
16.  Detailed long term plan was provided (for further funding) but since this is a short term challenge, more milestone for the next 6 months would have been useful.
17.  Very carefully outlined planning. All important data and facts for assessing feasibility, progress and success are provided. This also includes a best-effort KPI table for measuring the project's success. This project is definitely well-grounded and directly addresses the challenge of fund 2. Great job done by the team.
18.  I'd suggest reducing technical jargon. Good luck!
19.  Two very strong teams and proposals merged together here. It looks really promising and perfect for Fund 2's scope.
20.  The proposal is very well documented and already shows progress. So they are not starting from a blank page.
21.  Clear road map, clear budget, clear KPIs - without going into massive details - that's almost all I expect from any meaningful proposal at this early stage within dFund2 Catalyst proposal. BUT.
22.  I haven't read a single word of risk in any of the documents provided. Given the detail and very well thought out process - I don't get a good sense of understanding what contingencies have been thought of should things go not that well. What are the things that will keep you up at night until the project delivers?
23.  Little surprised this wasn't included at all.
24.  The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, credentials, and success metrics.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge.++

1.  Well written and thought out
2.  I think they have generated a good team to help attract developers and entrepreneurs with practical and educational tools.
3.  Yes, API's are are effective.
4.  Attracting Devs and Businesses to any platform requires easy access to educational resources and tools. The multi-pronged approach here provides several pathways by which the challenge is met, and generates greater adoption of Cardano. The team has already created samples of the work for each section of the Proposal and have shown their ability to continue producing high quality education and tools to facilitate the adoption of Cardano.
5.  This project is focused on building learning materials and starter kits for building dApps using cardano. The currently published starter kits are well written and focus on learning by doing.
6.  Having easily digested learning materials should lower the bar for new developers, enterpreneurs and will encourage them to get started with cardano.
7.  It could help the community to build something together. They request for a 3 months funding from the community which will be followed by a year of development funded by their own resources/ customers/sales. It is a gamble which takes a significant part of the bugdet, but I think it is fair to give it a try
8.  The proposal aims to attract developers by lowering barriers to entry by creating open-source tools in order to help individuals transition over to Cardano ecosystem.
9.  Direct and quite literal response to the challenge.
10.  APIs and tutorial material will be of great help to the development community.
11.  Wiith the merge of the Cardano APIs as a Community Service and the Cardano Starter Kits the entry level barrier can be greatly reduced. This definitely is right on the spot of the intended challenge.
12.  Great way to encourage developers to build on top of Cardano by providing a starting point and tools necessary for ease of entry into our Cardano Ecosystem. The proposal provides direct and effective KPI measures for the community to determine ROI based on number of developers and entrepreneurs encouraged to use Cardano.
13.  This hits the bullseye when it comes to the challenge of fund2!
14.  Yes, this is a great project to our community we need more structured content to help developers and entrepreneurs know more about Cardano. This proposal also help content creator to deliver more accurate information.
15.  i love this idea and feel good quality starter kits and smart contract examples would go a long way to onbarding existingand new developers to the Cardano ecosystem
16.  A slight problem with this type of proposal is that quality is also a very important aspect of the output and it needs to be defined. The proposal does not offer sufficient information on how the free and open source Cardano Starter Kits and Cardano APIs will be measured in terms of quality and engagement. If the project is delivered it still remains open if developers will be encouraged to build on Cardano and if entrepreneurs wil be encouraged to build on Cardano, if the quality of the output is not up to par.
17.  Perfect fit for fund2. As a developer to have such material to discover and start using a new platform is a dream. If a new dev has to choose between two platform, the one with this kind of learning/experimental material will win.
18.  This project is spot-on the challenge of fund 2. Creating Cardano Starter Kits and trainings for various target groups can really lead to a strong multiplication of people joining the Cardano community. This is definitely important for attracting developers and entrepreneurs, who can start putting hands-on in a very effective and efficient way.
19.  Before these two teams merged they were already both very relevant to Fund 2. Together they are a great solution.
20.  Having both a technical suite of tooling and some accompanying educational material to act as a gateway for developers and entrepreneurs is a fantastic idea.
21.  I think the idea is good, but I am sure if the format is the best way to go nonetheless, this could become a vector into the ecosystem or something to refer to.
22.  Fantastically clear mission statement and scope of the project (very few have it) that actually tackles the dFund2 challenge theme:
23.  ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""
24.  Thank you for taking time working on this.
25.  Cardano starter kits that cater to the different user groups would encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on Cardano.
26.  Seems simple enough to succeed.

04/Nov/20 3:13 AM,323433,1735,Chris Patten-Walker,"@adagial  Wow thank you for taking the time to review. It is a prototype and I will make notes on your comments. I found it tough getting the location of pool operators. I paid for the google maps API but was not able to implement due to getting not much help from the pools they did not want to reveal their locations. Yes the app does link to the forum and returns you back to the app. I am only listing pools that have provided video intros. Cardano is on FB and it still has a large following but I have noted your feedback. I may move the donation addresses under the smile for sure. Great idea !! I was hoping for at least a few lovelaces. Can you let me have the dates for the events and I will add. Click on the invite details for The Happy Hour it will take you to the location :-)

Thanks for your support.",NO
04/Nov/20 2:49 AM,323433,1735,Adagial,"@cpw  Chris I was just going through more of the app on the website and I just hit the live prices so it has a nice currency converter on it. I scrolled through the list of currencies converted and lots are missing. Any chance to expand that list Chris?

I went to the Calendar and thought it would be a good idea to add the Lovelace Academies two yearly semesters and the deadlines. Also I tried to find out where the happy hour was going down but it is not mentioned.... gets truncated if there was more after it. Of course I am only browsing on the web page.

Will the web page be staying up after the app goes live? I like it actually. I am still browsing through it.

Oh I signed up for something on the website so we will see you there no doubt. Oh yeah the Project Catalyst (Town Hall). Can't wait to see local town hall meetings and this app will really help aggregate that data.

It looks really polished already and so very professional. You even have some news trickling in but I am sure that will turn into the river Styx clearly marking the divide between the old and the new global systems.

Of course no new notifications. I went through all four Phases. I smiled when I read the Voltaire phase as we are practically doing that now.

Great collation of videos from CH. Perhaps a link to timestamps from Adatainment.

Great collation of videos from the IOG Battalion leaders keeping the community updated about the progress of the battle to free the Ouroboros completely.

Awesome the communities will furnish legions of video content as well.

Wow so will this tie into the Cardano forum user database then as well or just a static link to the forums?

I went to the groups tab and saw some content I had not seen in awhile and that first video is enough to start a beer garden where the currency is ADA and everyone just pays with ADA like normal people. Like seriously we need to get this into 8 Billions peoples heads. I would say the usage of GROUPS as a menu item is ambiguous especially when the mouse says businesses when you arrive at the tab.

Your obviously not listing all the pools in the pool tab yet and I have not read through any other messages or material actually. Just coming in with no bias. You may as well split the pools into continents and countries. That is how people will be searching anyhow. Like I want to be able to find local stake pools and where ADA is accepted and invested with. The list needs to grow with influx of new stake pools.

Super cool a Social Media page just for the App. I sure wish there was an alternative to Facebook though as so many people do not even use that platform anymore. I like how you are pulling the whole feed into the app though so a person does not have to actually be a member. Nothing more frustrating than going to a local buy and sell looking at all the stuff for sale but because you are not a member of the facebook cult you can't send a message and the users never post phone numbers. Meh.

Top Shows was interesting and it looks like it will feature various video channels - hope some of these starting using Bitchute, LBRY or otherwise. People are fleeing youtube in droves and likely will never return. Anyway I would hope it turns out to LIVE SHOWS where Stake Pool Operators perform in wide wide world at trade shows, three ring circus or Broadway shows or just doing street interviews of users buying and selling with Cardano and closing transactions. Anything to get the talented people up out of the chairs and interacting with their local communities - I can see the flyers now advertising special events and meetings.

Then a nice collation of youtube channel links. Meh.

Great FAQ.

Really a very nice about tab and the picture is priceless. Nice to see you Chris. You have a great smile but then everyone is going to get that very same ADA smile... Too bad we could not put a compressed .jpg into to metadata on every transaction for smiles on the blockchain or a picture of what you just bought with ADA.

But then ADA is a lot like selling smiles once people start using it. I was not sure of the team so I clicked on it and Micheal is the only team member. That POS system to handle ADA can't come quick enough. We could probably start providing a small town or village with POS systems so people can pay with ADApay or whatever we are calling it. Then of course you might have to have hooks for vendors on the app as well to access support and order more devices.

Nice looking payment address. I can see people hitting it more if you splashed your great ADAsmile under it...",NO
04/Nov/20 12:07 AM,323433,1735,Chris Patten-Walker,@adagial  Thanks for the feedback. Yes the app already has the ability for users to send messages and updates. I have just disabled it because the feedback was that many people do not want to register so I have decided to get traction first and then offer those features later. What I have built currently is a fully working prototype of the core functions.,NO
04/Nov/20 12:00 AM,323128,1667,Rob Greig,"@gradchemchem  thanks for the comment. I explain in more detail here https://youtu.be/4SLmED8HKjA

the majority of the funds are gained from partners and then ithe money reinvested into staking and purchasing more ada",NO
03/Nov/20 10:04 PM,323128,1667,gradchemchem,The idea is interesting but sustaining it from paid lessons/videos seems less profitable. I think more allocation to staking would be better for the overall funding performance. 15k ADA is only making 10-15 ADA per epoch and that doesn't look like it'll be much to help fund the rewards that will be handed out if there is actually a lot of people who start using it.,NO

Great work and thanks for bringing this into the proposals for a very low cost to the Treasury.

You obviously are one of the selfless players in the space and have always been there as an outward-facing explainer on many shows.

This project is simply waiting to integrate, correct?

If so, this should be a no-brainer in terms of risk/reward and upside value to the community.

03/Nov/20 6:30 AM,323433,1735,Adagial,bloody awesome this is f incredible I can type as fast as I talk now wow okay that being said I just enabled voice typing on my computer via my cell phone now that's a nice app it's called a remote mouse. your app on the other hand is basically redundant before it starts. that being said it is a nice app it aggregates data you're going to build it out great it will get new features but you'll never be able to contain all the sources of information unless the user submit themselves but I digress.personally I think the direction you really need to take this is in the form of another wallet and within that wallet there needs to be options too a:) create a node yes create a stake pool b:) pick your relay nodes. now everybody that downloads your wallet app can have the freedom to start their own pool either from their own phone or from instances ran in a data center and monitored by geeks like you and me over and out. the wallet app must also contain a seamless way to onboard new delegates from fear of crypto to a simple direct deposit or e-transfer through a company like ShskePay or through some custom exchange scripts utilizing the new delegators credit card all you have to do is give it an address and exchange that fiatand automatically turn it into Ada in one step then they can decide to either a :) delegate to a stake pool or b:) create their own State pool and see:) pick their relays. but go ahead with my idea of what your app should look like from my perspective as an end user that would love to set up his own stake pool for his local community garden down the road so that we can track our members resources properly and constantly reinvest in our community garden. Network parameters and geeky numbers to do with k or d which is what I'm eating as little as I can of but it's definitely on the menu you know what I'm saying yeah you're hearing me right so now we need this thing to take off with k values of over a million and that's what we need for cascading disruption we need people actually using the app people not nerds well we need those too but besides the point you know we want the fiat to be exchanged and invested in local community infrastructure or resources it could be something as simple as your niece's bridal shower and gift registry that lasts forever when everybody tips a thousand or two thousand or three thousand ada into the registry pool. anyway I can't seem to find my return key otherwise I would have properly made paragraphs. the point being Mary this sucker marry this app to the world and bring out the bridegroom so the decoupling can begin and whoever makes this up that I've just described and whoever paves away at the data centers with the bash scripts or whatever they have to do to get this thing up and running will finally provide a market bigger than any defi dapp Dao or otherwise for they will have captured the heart of the world. I mean ouroboros cardano it's going to be around a long time k value is are going to eventually be up there anyhow and we want to leverage all the compute power out there for our dragon you have to agree it can't just be for nerds. this network this beautiful hologram Network that somebody made an amazing thing for the other day needs a billion more dots how you going to get that if you don't make this app and your app is a great start and I'll take you anything you throw it there and so will the world but try and focus and visualize how to write this in pseudocode and make it a reality you are after all the one courting us and quite frankly some guy just made a nice website that does the same thing and quite frankly we're inundated with websites so much so that listing them all at 1200 and growing is becoming a problem so already we see quite plainly with our eyes that work that there is no standard for websites that represent the ouroboros protocol the closest one I found and the best one so far is adage. a PP yeah I put a space in between that for some reason and I'm too lazy to go back and correct it but you'll figure it out at least you should unless your mind's in the gutter anyway so yeah like I was saying what really has to happen is that these 1200 pools and this has to happen like yesterday. okay these pools need to be segregated geographically well I don't know are we allowed to say segregated anymore okay well just put a tickle lock on it then the pools need to be separated geographically see what I did there okay. so once we have them separated geographically then we can instill an installation of tradition and culture and of normative values that exemplify the best of the blockchain on display and that in and of itself will drive fierce competition that's an important word right now competition between spo's. and I do see good healthy competition but mostly it's just about the margin which is like so totally normal for greedy bastards anyway that's a good thing profit is the double-sided Senate of checks and balances it's going to be profit for everybody build the app adjust the network do whatever you got to do to get this in the hands of everyone with a phone and then when all the stake pools are listed geographically within a certain radius like selling real estate you see where the competition comes in because now there's stake pools everywhere. so this market this market is huge if you just put it in the hands of the ants. and if you ask me and you probably didn't but you kind of sort of did so you're like stuck with me but whatever I don't mind you guys so before like the d thingy gets to the zero we need to hit the ground running with this flat out so that when d is zero even the smallest state pool for the poorest family in the every neighborhood can start to exchange their toilet paper for proper ADA. and local communities can start to see a face at a local service that they can invest in to better their communities.,NO
03/Nov/20 4:20 AM,323861,1792,David Kanaszka Jr.,"Hello @whycardano   
  
Thank you for your great questions!  
  
1\. TheDealersDen.com currently operates as a marketing, sales, and auction platform for hundreds of active small businesses and entrepreneurs in the Cosplay Arts community. The Dealers Den is the foundation layer for many of these businesses, similar to online malls such as Etsy, eBay, or Amazon. Currently, these businesses use PayPal to process and finalize the majority of transactions, but with our new platform built on Cardano, we open up new, cost-effective payment rails for these businesses to transact on and features for them to utilize. Successfully migrating our current userbase alone would likely cause a significant rise in the transaction count and volume processed by Cardano, but with new infrastructure, we will be able to confidently expand our operations and our administrative team to handle even more, bringing value to all ADA holders.

  
2\. The 250,000 ADA requested in this proposal is a conservative estimate for the amount of funds needed for this platform build, based on the amount of work to complete it. Should the actual cost exceed this amount, The Dealers Den will cover the amount out of normal operating profit. Should the amount requested exceed the cost, the remainder will be used on additional modules to enhance the platforms capabilities and features. In both scenarios, 100% of every ADA received from Project Catalyst will go to developers within the Cardano ecosystem. A separate wallet will be created for Catalyst funds to avoid commingling and will be disbursed from the wallet directly to developers in the order described in the 'Visual Roadmap Descriptions' above. All transactions to/from the funding wallet will be publicly auditable on the Cardano blockchain and we are happy to share information with the Cardano community every time a payment is made, to whom it is made, and the progress made from the last payment.

  

3\. We are currently negotiating with some of the top developers in the Cardano space to reach an agreed price and timeline. While this project has been incubating for several months, the total scope is unclear until Goguen is fully released and we know exactly what tools we have to work with. Regardless of the outcome of Fund 2, we are very passionate about this project and will be pushing forward to accomplish this build in a reasonable time frame. However, if our proposal is successful in acquiring the necessary funds, we are confident that getting our project off the ground in the next six months will be a near certainty. The sooner we can begin building, the sooner we can begin contributing return value in the form of thousands of real-world transactions across the Cardano blockchain.  
  
We hope this answers your questions regarding our proposal. If not, please feel free to reply and we would be happy to discuss our plan further.",NO
02/Nov/20 11:35 PM,323861,1792,"Miguel ""Why Cardano"" ","Thanks for adding your proposal to the challenge.

A few questions regarding your extremely popular (top kudos rating) proposal.

  

1\. How will this project help attract entrepreneurs and developers onto Cardano? (The challenge goal)  

2\. Where can the budget be seen?

250,000 ADA is a large amount. Without seeing a breakdown this may limit the feasibility/auditability of this endeavor.

3\. As a reviewer, I see a nice description about the buildout. Any chance you can help connect the dots with costs, timeline, net impact to Cardano and meeting the overall goal of the FUND 2 challenge?

  

Cheers",NO
02/Nov/20 8:36 PM,322194,1444,Mercy,@archangelbob  Thanks so much for your comments and support Steve. Much appreciate you stopping by.,NO
02/Nov/20 8:06 PM,322194,1444,Project Catalyst Admin,"**Below is a summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors:**

++Impact: This proposal effectively addresses the challenge++

  

2 A lot of the proposal content is very general and could apply to just about any NGO. Can you please be specific on how you address the challenge.

3 Experienced team it appears they know the challenges.

4 The proposal is well planned and is targeting 60+ new members per month. These members will have access to well crafted training materials and knowledge resources to encourage their adoption of Cardano. It has the added benefit of meeting the Cardano Community's Pan African Agenda.

5 Imagine the world we want and start working toward it. I appreciate the ambition in this project because the value of information could be significant. With the Cardano vision of banking the unbanked, we will need a better understanding of the regions that Cardano most wants to serve. However, for fund2 it is not clear how this contributes directly to Fund2 challenge. It COULD yield new developers and entrepreneur, but only if the research has a clear direction. I would encourage the team to find promising ""green shoots"" that indicate more research is needed and that there is a high potential (low hanging fruit) to really make an impact

7 Proposer's team aims to attract developers and promote Cardano Blockchain to general audience by utilizing their on the ground presence in the region. Their mission aligns with IOHK's goal to target African continent as its main marketplace.

8 I believe this project is a concieved direct response to the challenge in the West African Region, actively searching for developers to train.

10 Even when the roadmap is not clear, the funds would go a long way if the team is passionate about it.

11 This proposal is great because it map developers and business and try to connect and give feedback on the tools that will come around our ecosystem.

12 Project in line with Fund2 challenge

13 The proposal is designed to encourage DApp developers and businesses to build on Cardano, however it is part of a much wider 3-year initiative that may not play out if the entire project is not furthered. The initial three month period has some specific deliverables and some that may be seen as too general and not measurable. Quality is king and we may need more focused commitments than just hitting certain checkmarks. How will the success and future prospects of this whole initiative be assessed at the end of the 3-month period. Not completely sure.

15 They show to be a great team with clear objectives to attract developers and entrepreneurs.

16 ""I wish all projects would create an executive summary that answers the:

""""""""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""""

in one paragraph or less. I can answer this based on reading the proposal but it would be nice to have that concise summary right off the bat. Then no confusion would be left around. Unsure how many people would read everything to get that sense of understanding.

I like it's long-term vision though. Having a regional VC like entity that will help drive the adoption of Cardano is a very useful case. Especially, given the chain is for these parts of the world the most. ""

17 Having a dedicated task force in West Africa promoting and advocating for the use of the Cardano blockchain, would be very beneficial not only for cardano's ecosystem but more importantly to the inhabitants of west Africa. The proposal is in harmony with cardano's goals, intentions and goals.

18 A promising opportunity to expand the use of Cardano in a targeted way, inside 'developing nations' that are perfect use cases for the platform's features.

19 A committee that would promote Cardano in the region.

++Feasibility: Given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully++

20 Hard to say as it is a grand vision.

21 The Team and those already collaborating with them are well positioned to carry this proposal well beyond the scope of this initial funding round. The work that has already been accomplished is very telling of the intentions and abilities of the entire team.

22 This an ambitious project, but seems speculative in nature. I would like some concrete indicators of clear potential which warrant further investigation. Even some time spent of their own volition to do initial scans, interviews, surveys could go a long way to reveal promising areas. I think more work is needed to establish that this proposal has legs to it.

23 The proposor asks for about $30K for the first 3 months on a 3 year project. IMHO this project is more likely to be proposed in 2023 when the ecosystem has created more and reliable value in other ways and more funds become available

24 Detailed plan presented with clear timelines and budget spending. Versatile and experienced team already assembled. This proposal requests 29 7825 ADA in order to fund first 3 months of operation, with future plans to keep operating and expending well into the 3 year mark.

25 I believe the proposal will at least be attempted in full stride and earnest effort. I stil see several challenges with the remote distribution of the members, and their little experience working together. Still they also seem aware of these challenges which is a strong positive

26 ""My assessment only comes from trust in the team.

I can't find a hard point in the proposal.""

27 The team has the core capabilities to deliver what has been proposed and have clear objectives, one thing i missed a bit was what each team member will be responsible to deliver.

28 Yes based on the credentials and experience of the team, but this has to be proven after 3 months

29 Yes, the experience and the plan - as presented - seem deliverable. Yet, the wider plan that this introductory project is leading up to, may not be as easy to follow-up on. The concern may be whether this is too big of an ambition without a supplementary funding source identified: ""evolving to become a venture capitalist type organization dedicated to growing West African startups dedicated to building on the Cardano protocol.""

30 Each member of the team shows experience and together they make the proposal strong. In addition, alliances with the Cardano structure, other Catalyst projects, governments and more are expected. So the plan would appear to be successful.

31 ""I have concerns over formation of the team and its dynamics. I am unclear on the fact if team members are a good fit to maintain this project over its projected lifetime.

I like the profiles etc. - but it would have been clearer if each member was highlighted what their particular role in the project is - one anticipate based on their profile - but would be easier to get that right away.

I also would like to understand if there are any concerns about workload and if there is enough manpower/funds available to make that happen. Seems a very broad scope of activities and narrow output returns.

Would these be full time commitments or along side existing job requirements, etc. ""

32 The plan of action to solve the given problem is pretty detailed and clear. The team behind the project seem to be skilled with solid experience.

33 The team has a strong and diverse background and presents a realistic plan. It could be improved with an additional crypto-focused tech person, but that can be rectified quickly.

34 The proposers have a diverse team with relevant experience.

++Auditability: The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is and how effectively it addresses the challenge++

35 Please clarify what the deliverables are.

36 Feasible with hard work.

37 The level of detail provided and the clear targets for measuring success make it quite easy to see that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge and will be successful in accomplishing the goals as they are laid out.

38 Clearly a lot of effort and passion have gone into this! I encourage the team to explore this further and really build a compelling case. It needed more work to tie the effort to Fund2 challenge outcomes.

39 For now it is far to soon to setup a large project like this with a Cardano system still in development

40 This proposal addresses the current Fund2 Challenge and aligns with IOHK's mission to enter African continent as a target marketplace. This could provide additional boost to what Cardano's long term vision is - inform and educate the unbanked society primarily on African continent about the power of blockchain tech.

41 It is thoroughly written and clear within the expectations of the format and medium

42 The roadmap is vague.

43 Yes, this proposal has clear objectives and KPIs, its ready to go.

44 very detailed information. feasible project to be assessed after 3 months

45 There is something a bit formulaic and not focused enough in terms of the project's feasibility and how it will deliver value for money to the Cardano community.

46 ""I would have appreciated the outlook for the future if beyond first 3 months - budgetary requirements are going to change or remain the same, etc.

There is a multi year plan - great to see the roadmap - so having some basic understanding of what that looks like financially would be great.

Meaning - we get involved these first three months - what sort of commitment is going to be required down the road. ""

47 There will need to be regular updates and reports on the advancement of the proposal. The content (video, document, podcast...) and the location (website, youtube, social media platform...) of those updates should be or could be defined.

48 The team has put together a reasonable and 'open-eyed' risk assessment which suggests they are approaching this endeavour with the right mindset to push past adversities in a positive way. The nature of their proposal carries significant inherent risk, but it seems like a good opportunity for the Treasury and aligns well with Fund 2.

49 The proposal includes a clear understandable description of the problem and solution, roadmap, milestones, deliverables, and credentials.

I wish you and your team the best. You have my vote. I think your ideas are sound and most definitely in alignment with the larger Cardano goals.

If I could suggest anything it would be to spend some time focusing on how to integrate supply-chain tracking on the Cardano blockchain to your local economies, and do what is possible to expand this technology as early as possible into your efforts in West Africa. I feel that when it comes to the larger economic situation in Africa, the absolute proof this technology could bring to the relative ease of daily living and working would be a subtle, yet powerful catalyst for broader growth on all levels.

I hope to visit one day.

Peace,

Project Scope: I am aware that this proposal alone doesn't address the challenge effectively. It is not my intention to do so, but to help others do it. That's why I propose to finish this work within a few weeks, to share the results so other proposers can take advantage of them. Instead of developing a second phase myself for this proposal, I would prefer that this work served as a first phase for other proposals, like this one: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Developer-Acquisition-Campaign/322366-48088

Research Scope: The R&D approach you are suggesting would indeed be the most effective to help develop a new feature, product, etc. However, I don't envision my work being used in this formal way, but to improve the strategies of those trying to attract developers to the network. I believe that having a better knowledge of these developers' comments regarding the technology they are currently using would help develop more effective strategies (know where to put the emphasis) when trying to approach and convince them to migrate to Cardano.

Cheers!",NO
31/Oct/20 9:21 PM,324303,1857,Borja Bonet Segui,"@greg.pendlebury  Hi Greg, thank you for taking the time to comment. Well, I thought we were here to help with the adoption of Cardano and doing this is what came to my mind when I saw the challenge.

I guess the point of your comment is to check that I am who I claim to be (this identity theft issue you mention), because I don't think you are worried about my finances. **I have added a link to this page on my LinkedIn profile.** It does not really prove anything, but at least you can check that the LinkedIn profile is under my control.

I do not have any working experience in the space, so I can't show you any portfolio. I am just a guy that has been following the development of cryptocurrencies for the last few years and is interested in what is being built here. I thought it would be interesting to be part of the Project Catalyst and share some ideas. I am not here to make a big profit, I consider myself a learner in the space. So far it has been interesting, and the community will vote if the proposed work would be helpful enough.

29/Oct/20 11:03 PM,322195,1445,Greg Pendlebury,"@rcmorano  I think you are correct in that there are very careful ways to use GPL-style licenses in a commercial context... but they often scare users away because of how aggressively 'copy-left' they seek to be. e.g. I have worked in a few teams where managers refuse to let GPL code into the codebase because they are afraid that later a junior dev will accidentally copy/paste some lines of code into a new location with a different context and cause the license to 'taint' more of the codebase than was intended.

My reading of your proposal was that there is probably no strong reason to use GPL anyway, so Apache 2 will likely appeal to a broader set of users without detracting from the license protections.",NO
29/Oct/20 6:28 PM,322288,1501,Jeronimo Backes,"@rgj987  the point is to enable customers and online stores to transact on the cardano blockchain. It doesn't benefit Shopify as it allows stores to escape paying commissions on every sale. As shopify is huge, there's a potentially larger number of people who will be able to use cardano to buy online.

Also the objective of this work is to build the infrastructure required to enable cardano on all major e-commerce platforms. Shopify is just the first step in that direction. Most of the work to do here is on core infrastructure that is not even shopify specific: wallet, database, customer communications, discount setup, blockchain monitoring, reporting, etc - none of that depends on Shopify.  

This core will be used later on for woocoommerce, PrestaShop and others, and that will come fast once the groundwork laid here is completed.

The (long term) end goal is to eventually support online stores to run on our free-commerce servers and even help shops to migrate from these proprietary platforms into ours - and that migration will be easier because we'll be already connected to them.",NO
29/Oct/20 5:35 PM,322288,1501,irishperil,"@rgj987  the answer to why do the work ""for them"", is because it really is ""for Cardano"". It could be 3-5 years before enough Shopify store owners request that feature.

The point of going after this platform is the chance to get in front of millions of people checking out on their sites. To see ""we accept ADA"" even if they don't use it, goes along way in the public perception of everyday shoppers.

It says, we will provide an easy on ramp into our system now so people can shuffle in as they discover us rather than leaving it up to chance that demand builds up until Shopify decides to address it.",NO
29/Oct/20 4:58 PM,322288,1501,Bob.J,"@jbax  Nevertheless Shopify is a big profitable company, one could say a monopoly in its niche. Why do the work for them? They are surely able to do this for themselves, and no doubt they will when ADA takes off on other platforms. I think the focus should primarily be with free open-source shopping carts.",NO
29/Oct/20 4:48 PM,322195,1445,rcmorano [PEACEpool by La RepsistancE],"@greg.pendlebury  Thanks for your feedback!

From my understanding (might be wrong), GPLv3 is ok for commercial usage while source code is not redistributed; in e.g. bundle our source code on a commercial software package.  
If someone plans to do something like that, they'd have to opensource their product under GPLv3 also (that's why we usually say GPLv3 is ""too viral"").

Maybe a LGPLv3 could do the job, tho I'd be glad to use Apache2/MIT/BSD.",NO
29/Oct/20 3:26 PM,322572,1596,Community Member,"(1) How can this proposal address the challenge more effectively?  
The challenge is: ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""  
Creating a group on Gitcoin which is Haskell-centric is great to attract more developers.  
  
It's not clear though if this needs to be Haskell specific or Cardano-specific. If it is to promote development of projects on Cardano, does that mean the developer must know Haskell? You can clarify this in order to address the challenge more effectively.  
  
(2) How can this proposal's budget, plan, scope or team modified increase likelihood of successful implementation?

It would be nice if you can add a process flow to clearly illustrate what you are proposing to do. While reading this proposal twice, there seems to be a misunderstanding that the budget is to issue grants on Gitcoin.

  
(3) What information needs to be added for this proposal to be accurately reviewed?

Information on who the key people involved in this proposal would be helpful.

thanks for taking the time to comment and for the excellent feedback",NO
28/Oct/20 7:51 PM,324303,1857,Borja Bonet Segui,"@trevor.benson  Hi Trevor, thank you for your comment.

  

*Statement is unclear. Is this part of a larger project or is it modular? I suggest removing anything that explains what the proposal could be, but is not. Instead concentrating on clearly defining only what the projects scope includes.*

**I am sorry if the scope statement creates confusion. My intention was to give the reason why I think the scope of the proposal should be limited instead of part of a bigger project like it was suggested by one of the comments above. I am afraid the proposal cannot be edited anymore in this phase (no edit button). Anyway, answering your question, it is modular.**

  

*Describe in more detail how the information will help achieve the fund2 challenge.*

**The information will help achieve the fund2 challenge by helping those working directly to bring entrepreneurs and developers to Cardano, being able to develop more tailored and efficient strategies. For instance, it would directly benefit proposals like https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Developer-Acquisition-Campaign/322366-48088#idea-tab-comments**

  

*Provide details on how you expect to engage participants. For instance LinkedIn messages, posting on social media asking for volunteers or offering rewards/payment per interview in ADA, etc. Given many people ignore LinkedIn messages and delete requests for interviews I feel you should extend the amount of time required and allot for time required to find*

*Week 2 Metrics: Interviewing a sample size of 20 total developers, 10% of your database, may be an overly optimistic goal within 7 days. I suggest adding additional time to cover building a larger database and/or finding willing candidates to be interviewed such that it allows for developing the refined questionnaire during the following time period.*

*Week 3. Unsolicited email (UCE or not) I feel is unlikely to achieve 15% response rates. The proposal does not appear to consider that the time between inquiry and response could easily last more than 1 week. I'd suggest at least an additional week to allow time for ""straggler"" responses and increase the probability*

**I have thought of using professional-social networks as the main way to engage participants. LinkedIn is the most known, but I could also use the Nova network as well (https://novatalent.com/). Maybe it is hard to get high reply rates in LinkedIn, but I believe it should be easier in the Nova network, since it is a private network where people is more willing to engage with each other. Also, using my 1st-degree connections (people I directly know) to introduce me to blockchain entrepreneurs or developers would accelerate the process.**

**Regarding your suggestion of adding additional time, I am afraid this could not be done at this point, since my understanding is that the proposals are already final. In any case, the reason why I have included a 5th week is to allow for some extra time should it be hard to get the number of replies I am aiming for. Please note that since the goal of this proposal is to help other proposals achieve the challenge in fund2, it was important to have the results as fast as possible (hence the 50 hours per week).**

*Week 4: What kind of content will the deliverable document contain? Who is this documents intended audience, IOHK, Emerugo, Stakepool Operators, Smart Contract / Dapp developers on other chains? How do you envision the final document is used? Will IOHK & Emurgo use it to add features and functionality to the code/protocol? Will it be sent out to developers or their employers in hopes to entice them to move development to Cardano?*

**The idea behind this proposal is to help other marketing-focused proposals like the one referenced above in this comment, so they are the intended audience. The content of the document will reflect the information provided by the interviewees regarding their experiences using the blockchain so far. When possible, I would like to include pie charts or other more appropriate graphical content to make a statistical summary of the results.**

*Week 5: Would week 5 be unpaid? Does it require and additional 3125 ADA in funding for the additional 50/hrs?*

**Week 5 is part of the project, to provide more flexibility so the target can be met. It will not require extra funding.**",NO

It sounds like the requested amount of funds are going to be for funding the exchange, therefore a portion of the profits should be returned to the Cardano Foundation or some how put back into the Cardano eco system.

Also, I understand that the owner wants to protect himself and not release the code open-sourced. This explorer is currently the most complex and advanced explorer on market and even IOHK engineering is using it. By open-sourcing it in current phase the owner will be risking that somebody other who is better funded will fork it and take over the market.

This is an interesting article but I have some comments and questions that need clarification…

*""Liqwid is governed by its members. Only members can introduce proposals or vote on updates. A Liqwid DAO & governance module will be introduced to coordinate operational strategy of the protocol into the future… Liqwid is simply a protocol.""*

If you are not a bank, how is this not redundant? It seems like it's a blockchain on a blockchain.

*""(e.g. zkProof user privacy features and reducing taxable events)""*

That sounds like the promotion of tax fraud.

*""quickly iterating in the direction of uncollateralized lending""*

Where is the data for this? Most of the defi products have only been around for a few months and are tanking. How is the solution for ninja loans, zero knowledge loans?

*""A three-month US Treasury bill (T-bill), for example, is backed 1:1 by the ""full faith and credit"" of the US government (military), which has never defaulted on its debt obligations, meaning real risk-free interest rates and inflation expectations are the key variables likely to impact expected rate of return.""*

How is this a bad thing?

*""Under normal circumstances, longer-term investments carry a greater risk premium. In general, the shorter time period of a bond or debt instrument means it is \*less likely\* to default than its long-term equivalent, making long-term bonds and debt instruments less attractive to investors.""*

This is true but isn't this why historically longterm bonds yields are higher

*""Bitcoin is highly regarded as one of the most liquid securities purely based on the fact the markets don't close and anyone can mark-to-market at any time they choose.""*

But also, conveniently made it impossibly expensive to pull you money out when the market crashed in 2017 allowing the richest to cash out, while small bag holders took the loss. How would Liqwid incentivize its users not to mass exodus from a pool?

*""Liquidation incentives built into the Liqwid protocol incentivize traders (5% discount premium on collateral repaid + 1% governance tokens) to call the liquidate contract function to repay a percentage of a borrower's unhealthy loan value to mitigate Liqwid's aggregate default risk across all Liqwid Pools).""*

This doesn't make sense

For example, a bond with a par value of $1,000 that is trading at $950 has a bond discount of 5%.

What would stop someone from spamming the system and keep walking away with 5%

*""Liqwid users (arbitrageurs, developers, bots, traders) who call the liquidate contract function repay up to 50% of the borrowers collateral in their loan account balance. In exchange, they receive a proportionate amount of the borrowers collateral but at a discounted price (5% discount price premium + 1% governance tokens).""*

Alice borrows 1000 from Mike and dies. Bob repays Mike 500 in and is supposed to receive collateral at a discount plus governance tokens… what collateral? Where?

Also, what is to stop someone from buying up all the governance tokens?

Also, how are these pools not just CDOs?

*""the first version of decentralized credit unions in the DeFi space.""*

This seems redundant on a POS protocol.

*""NFT digital asset collateral""*

How do you mitigate the change in value of an NFT during the course of a loan?

*""Liqwid Ramps will provide cash-on ramps (and eventually cash- off) for holders of digital currencies in traditional CeFi fintech apps (USD in Venmo/Cash app) to enable direct web2 to web3 cash on ramps for our users.""*

How will you do this without being a bank?

*""In the sad path the user defaults…""*

This whole paragraph sounds a lot like a CDO, how is it different?

*""The uncollateralized stablecoin loan product unpacked above is based on the concept that these borrowers are Atala Prism & LiqwiDAO verified (or delegated) borrowers that tie financial and social incentives to the borrower to repay their loan.""*

Can you elaborate, what social incentives and how will they be enforced?

It sounds like a novel project, but it also seems like you are offering some financial products that historically have hurt investors on a system that lacks enforcement.",NO

*   Feasibility - What are ways in which this proposal's budget, plan, scope or team can be modified to make it more likely for the proposal to be successfully implemented?

  

Provide details on how you expect to engage participants. For instance LinkedIn messages, posting on social media asking for volunteers or offering rewards/payment per interview in ADA, etc. Given many people ignore LinkedIn messages and delete requests for interviews I feel you should extend the amount of time required and allot for time required to find

Week 2 Metrics: Interviewing a sample size of 20 total developers, 10% of your database, may be an overly optimistic goal within 7 days. I suggest adding additional time to cover building a larger database and/or finding willing candidates to be interviewed such that it allows for developing the refined questionnaire during the following time period.

Week 3. Unsolicited email (UCE or not) I feel is unlikely to achieve 15% response rates. The proposal does not appear to consider that the time between inquiry and response could easily last more than 1 week. I'd suggest at least an additional week to allow time for ""straggler"" responses and increase the probability

Week 4: What kind of content will the deliverable document contain? Who is this documents intended audience, IOHK, Emerugo, Stakepool Operators, Smart Contract / Dapp developers on other chains? How do you envision the final document is used? Will IOHK & Emurgo use it to add features and functionality to the code/protocol? Will it be sent out to developers or their employers in hopes to entice them to move development to Cardano?

I'd like to see more concrete details around funding expectations and milestones. For instance you mention the 6 month timeline, and 10K ADA a month. Maybe one milestone per month, or milestone per every 2 months would make the proposal more audit-able.

Also while I feel portfolios benefit both delegators and stakepool operators what is not immediately clear is a direct correlation to the fund 2 challenge statement. It would help if you elaborated how you envision this proposal encouraging developers to build Dapps and entrepreneurs building businesses around cardano within the 6 month time frame. At the moment it appears the completion date would actually line up with the end of the challenge statement, meaning any impact it might have in this area is likely to be in the 6-12 month timeframe, not within the next 6 months.

I am going through the text and answer some questions.  
Starting with the steps to take.

  

After we have decided on tech to use, we will start creating tooling to make it easier to create content.

The first step would be a tool to draw/put together a game map.  
The next tooling would be for player user experience.  
Then some tooling for creating creatures and characters.

We too are creating a game, but with that comes tooling first, which means other users of the open-source platform, could make games before us. Our focus is to make a good game editor.

  

You captured my goal pretty clearly.

I agree with you I should have created a roadmap here before.  
I will create the estimations once I have team input on how much time it takes for them to do some specific tasks.

23/Oct/20 11:28 PM,323311,1705,Stranger,"Hi,

I believe that this fits very well into Fund2. To create an incentive for developers to develop on Cardano it needs two things: A need or killer feataure - and funding. The killer feature here is secure voting on blockchain. Switzerland has seen all of their evoting projects failing due to security issues, not because people would not adopt it. If Cardano developers could propose a voting solution, which is simple, secure and fulfilling all needs in democratic voting (unicity of votes, privacy, countability) - that is in addition at the beginning financed by Cardano funds - we may convince a local community or canton to give it a try.

A proof of concept would be the start.

The proposal could become maybe more specific in breaking it down to a small start piece which is doable in a shorter period of time. In order to generalise it - and get more support from the community, the focus should be on secure evoting app, which could be applied/used anywhere.

23/Oct/20 10:20 AM,324032,1829,Filip,"Hello guys,

great and interesting project, read your Q2 2020 report, looks very professional. I would suggest putting up some auditable goals. You are asking for 500 000 ADA which is a significant chunk of the fund, I think it is realistic you will have auditors if you receive funding. So, can you please define 3 or more concrete goals or milestones in a chosen time period? e.g.

Creating a detailed breakdown of ADA lending currently - 2 weeks

I would suggest clearing up on how impactful this is for Cardano and how aligned is it with the fund goal. If you want to align yourself with Cardano completely, you could decide to receive payments from your clients in ADA exclusively (I know this is a long shot, just a suggestion).

And finally for feasibility metric, these are your goals:

1\. Integrate with Cardano

2\. Build out cross-chain clusters (so that credit data from Ethereum address clusters, for example, can be associated with Cardano address clusters)

3 Integrate with Cardano oracle pools.

I don't really understand what do these mean and it very well may be because I am not an expert on the subject, but can you maybe clarify it a bit (or ""dumb it down"" if you like :grinning: ) just so the voters and auditors can better understand what can we expect from the project. e.g.

we can expect a credit score for Cardano wallets who borrow through stable lenders (to be defined) in 9 months or

we can expect a well defined credit score building system in 3 months or

we can expect all services to be at 50% discount to Cardano DeFi devs after 3 months in order to attract more of them

as for running an actual relay on a satellite, not as bad as you might think. i was hoping to take advantage of the SpaceX pricing for launch, particularly ride shares with the Starlink Constellation they are putting up to provide Rural internet service. one of my thoughts along those lines is my Telescopes could take advantage of the high speed low latency internet they provide by running all of my satellite communications through their network.  
  
their current loaded latency figures are something like 45ms surface to satellite to point of injection with the internet. perhaps not as fast as an AWS server farm, but really quite reasonable for broadband internet service anywhere in the world. and when their second tier satellites go up and start providing network relay services via laser communication between satellites... you could have a global ping under 100ms anywhere in the world, and i mean anywhere. you could be on a boat in the most remote parts of the ocean and potentially get sub 100ms broadband internet to any server on earth. or, as my hope is, even in low earth orbit.",NO

The integration is being built for the blockchain infrastructure instead of the ADA token. Once more tokens become available on the blockchain these will be usable on day one to make online purchases.

As for cost, keep in mind we are asking for a fraction of the market rates already (barely covers the salary of one junior developer and even then a typical company would bill 150 per hour, a lead engineer would cost 400 or more), and we are opening the source code of past private projects of our company that can be reused here.

To explain our intent: We'd ideally consider the new participant as a direct hire to continue working with us. One benefit being a La French Tech company (which we are) is that once we've onboarded and validated a candidate over the course of three months, we're eligible to apply Bourse French Tech funding (which we've already secured) to continue employing this person into end of second quarter 2021. In parallel, during this time, our aim is to certainly to drive more growth (traction, revenue, etc.) and secure additional funding to go beyond, both in terms of operations and the ~5-6 month employment period for the candidate we end up hiring.

Great job and good luck!",NO
22/Oct/20 11:40 AM,324066,1835,Community Member,"Hi tevo, I will do my best to give feedback according to Anna's guidelines:

(1) How can this proposal address the challenge more effectively?

As discussed above, it is a little bit unclear on the exact impact of this project to Cardano community, so I suggest developing concrete action steps on how to do that (regardless of the scale of impact), for example: I will develop 10 playable weapons that will not be put in game until tokenized on Cardano (maybe it's not a great example, but it's something we can hold on to).

""All these do not directly boost the Cardano economy but give people access to knowledge that will teach them how to do various technical and operational actions related to creating and running a game. Advanced users will learn how to create tokens and about blockchain use cases in Cardano"" - can you set a clear expectation on this, maybe we can expect a small course, a set of YouTube training videos, some learning materials?  

Going through your materials it is pretty clear that you've put in significant work, you have a story line, weapon systems, classes of playable and non-playable chareacters etc. The potential for the adoption of the game is there and the only real way we've seen so far games integrated with blockchains is through NFTs, so my suggestion would be to have some sort of ""special"" items as NFTs that would not otherwise be available to the players (more like collectibles, it is maybe better to avoid overpowered weapons or abilities). This could potentially attract developers and designers to create these items.

(2) How can this proposal's budget, plan, scope or team modified increase likelihood of successful implementation?  

Let's try to define the scope: what is the end goal and how can we track it? For example: My goal is to release the game publically with clear marketing that it will be integrated with Cardano through NFTs (just trying to give a suggestion, I don't know if this is your goal)

If that is the goal, let's think about the plan: We can expect the beta version to be released in 3 months - during that period I will hire 1 designer, 1 developer, budget for them is 10000 ADA per month (again, just an example)

This process will make you think in more details how to execute your plan and it will give the community something to audit you by.

(3) What information needs to be added for this proposal to be accurately reviewed?  

The community advisors review proposals based on auditability, impact and feasibility. More details about this were discussed yesterday in the Town Hall (the video is up on IOHK's YouTube channel in case you missed it).

Auditability - milestones are important here, let's try to put up clear goals that are realistic e.g. game promotion video in 1 week, game promotion booklet with explanation of the in-game systems in 3 weeks, development of 3 new quests in 1 month etc.

Impact - let's connect it to Cardano a bit more - you can make a puzzle level that introduces people to Cardano, Ouroboros maybe, Project Catalyst etc. System of collectible rare items can be maybe implemented without NFTs for now and if adopted can be moved to Cardano when the time is right.

Feasibility - you already did a big chunk of work, you have some relevant experience, feasibility will depend on your goals (how high do you want to shoot). Try to find a balance between impactful and feasible work.

I hope this helps, good luck, great idea!",NO

I watched some of your videos - very good work. Kudos.

It really has a good place in the eco system and I can see the value added potentially. However, we do have to come back down to Earth for a moment. Just like Yuta has hinted already - looking at the budget break down would be useful at this point.

Appreciate your work on this proposal. I like the idea concept behind it.

I have few thoughts that caught on as reading through. If you will allow me.

You have mentioned that you are seeing an MVP - from the video it seems that some sort of MVP like client is already available? Or did I misinterpret the current status of the project? The account logged in on the video presentation is from 2019. So just trying to match dots in my head a bit better.

The thing is - I am not confident with timeline just yet. If the video solution is from 2019 already (at least) - what is the current timeline for the road ahead? I understand the goal to get certain number of gyms - but when taking step back - what time needs to elapse before this can be taken into brick and mortar situation? I am unable to decipher that by myself.

You are seeking to partner with gyms/health facilities. I wonder - have you already presented this solution to any of them and what their feedback has been like? Or this is entirely fresh concept that hasn't been seen by actual health related professionals?

Also - there are some discrepancies between the ideascale text and actual proposal. In the text above it states to have 6 gyms before roll out - but the document talks about 100 projects before roll out. I think - unifying the goals would be desirable to ensure actual accountability is spot on.

I really fancy the concept - will be definitely checking you out once this is ready to roll out.

Hello N045B,

Thank you for the clarification. So is this something like a pool promotion then? Because, you may be missing target audience entirely.

If delegation by CF or IOG is your goal - it would make sense to create this proposal and submit to those organisations separately.

Given that this project isn't now requiring funds - I don't know if it can go further. As in with 0 on the balance.

I struggle with the concept still. It would probably need a bit more work on it to make it stand on its legs.

I understand the mechanics behind what you are trying to accomplish but I am unsure if this is the best venue to get traction for the pool delegation. I could be mistaken though.

Thank you for the proposal. I don't have too many comments at this point as I've given these on SPOCRA forum initially.

However, it will be crucial to determine the allocation of these funds. SPOCRA board is 7 core and 2 shadow members. Is the expectation that work commissioned through this proposal is directly by the board members or will other individuals/entities be considered instead. Or combination of such.

This is hinted upon at the end of the proposal. It is probably something worth considering now that most board members have a real mandate. Figured, I'd bring it up as the proposal goes into the next stages.

Thank you for this proposal as well. I highly appreciate the video add-on, too. It is nice to be able to combine various ways of information.

I second Yuta's thought with regards to the positioning of this podcast. I think you would have a great opportunity to work on penetrating slavic audience - namely Ukrainian and Russian. I haven't followed up that rabbit hole yet - but are there any Russian speaking podcasts already? Have they gained any traction or is the field wide open? Because if it is - I would focus on that immensely.

When writing a proposal, I would generally avoid writing things like:

*""We will think about other translations (Japanese, French, Italian, Spanish)""*

because it suggests to the voter they will pay you to think. Which isn't incorrect but it has a greater weight if you turn it into definitive saying - we will make available transactions in such and such language. You will build a good rapport that way.

When speaking about mode of getting the word out such as:

*""Each publication will be also shared on 10+ crypto blog platforms with thousands of total views""*

it helps to establish what platforms and their relevance. Otherwise, it is missing the context. I see some are mentioned few lines down but seemingly unrelated.

Having said that - it definitely helps to explain the works of the budget and timeline a bit better. (P.S.: I think it isn't updated with 75,515ADA yet) I am having troubles figuring that out - which is really crucial for the project. Why? Because it enables you to lay down a plan with specifics. Otherwise, you don't know if you are heading in a good direction after a while.

Hence, things like benchmarking of your performance indicators is very desirable. In few months time - looking back - how will we judge whether your efforts were worth the commitment?

At any rate, I really like the potential of this. Especially, given language subset that can be very attractive to drive adoption. And we know that's been cumbersome in Cardano outside of major English thought train.

Thank you for your thoughtful response. Very much appreciated.

You've raised several valid points. My remark with the 888,888 funding numbers was just anecdotal - it is distracting a bit - that's what I meant. You have a very serious proposal with very valid reasoning. It would be shame to distract potential people with questions why such an odd number of 888,888. It can lead to distractions from the core purpose of your proposal. I would suggest something like 888,000 or 880,000. It virtually is the same thing but now has no glitter on it. :)

Apart from the points you've addressed - I am thinking this could pivot into the global brand. You've hinted on it in your podcast interview and that's something that could have some legs. So - I'd kick the ball even further.

How about using the money to partner with local institutions in any given city and provide for license/branding of those premises under 'Cardano Hub' brand instead. This can actually come in variety of forms and

A: does not always require you to be on the ground hands on in each instance.

B: it also relieves you of the heavy cash flow required to fund real estate projects

C: it allows you to focus on the brand and awareness as you grow - which is what we are after in these early stages of Cardano.

That's just my personal observation. I think that could have, potentially, far more reaching impact. Coming from real estate myself - that's also more likely to get funded by community. Because now there is a chance of getting this around the world closer to any Cardanian out there. It may be difficult for voters to connect with your home city alone. If that makes sense.

At any rate, I will leave the brainstorming for you. Thank you for your hard work on this and looking forward where you'll take it from here.

Seems like there hasn't been made an update in a while. I recommend - given the current timeline - to pause Fund2 pursuit and place WITHDRAWN into the title for better clearance.

Thank you for your proposal. That was the major issue that came to my head when reading your proposal. It would be worth making that distinction in your proposal for everyone to understand the relationship between ERC converters and these bridges.

I think - many people will confuse the two and may not be interested in funding because of what IOG may be up to already.

Have you given it some thought how to clear any doubts? Again - remember - it is the voters that will be judging proposals and they may not necessarily be technical by nature.

With regards to your goals - you mention about having the team assembled. Is there already a tentative roster or are you starting fresh? Curious to understand if you have explore this project with other partners already. It may improve your perseverance of getting this project off the ground. Human factor is very important in the early stages and finding right people takes time - unsure if one month is enough - granted there aren't any shortlisted candidates yet.

I also see you've set a monthly goal of 100 users. What is your desired curve on growth thereafter one month. Generally, one month is too short of a period to do reasonable benchmarking because it can produce false positives. It may be better to stretch the timeline into at least 3 months to get it reasonable. I assume this will not be your primary commitment, correct?

Looking forward how you develop this further. Keep up the good work.

Dear Daniel ,  
  
I think I understand now , that laying out more clearly how the ADA would be used would connect the dots for voters in their mind when it comes time. I think the simplest way to understand it would be to consider it my fee . The recording studio , editing room , editing skills , recording skills , sound mastering , guitar playing , Blockchain knowledge , INFJ personality , idealist vision , and my passion all come packaged together with the most important quality of all . . . the ability to finish a song .  
  
If Blockchain Wants A Composer , Then Edward Loose Is Here . I hope that the first song I write about Blockchain is on CARDANO . This will be bragging rights in the future for IOHK and a marketable headline .  
  
Built into the price is also a lot of very rare footage I have collected and will use without extra charge such as the ' Moon Rise Over The Himalayas ' I featured on Week Two's video update .  
  
If you still think this is too vague , or needs amending please let me know . Winning this means a lot to me .  
  
Yours Sincerely ,

14/Oct/20 4:27 PM,323408,1730,Daniel Ribar,"Hello Guys,

Fantastic job and effort. Took me a while to chew through everything. But I would have expected no less from you guys - reading names on the list. Kudos.

Knowing this project is asking for the sizeable portion of the entire fund lot available - I think that's only understandable. So not surprised.

Hence, I dived in a bit. I am little conflicted with KPIs. Again - point me in case I've missed it somewhere along the way.

I am having troubles quantifying the metrics. I feel there is A LOT that you guys are planning to accomplish in the time frame provided. Unsure even if a year would be enough. I've read the responses but not 100% convinced on feasibility of the timeline. Granted - my experience in this particular sector is not overwhelming so I am tip-toeing somewhat. You do have a good sized team so maybe that can make up the timeline somewhat.

But back to actual proposal.

Since this is a 6 month endeavour funding - what KPIs are most relevant for this first 6 month cycle and what are your targets on those specifically? I've read through the KPI in the presentation but that doesn't give me substance - as in what are the actual goals that we will be able to benchmark this project against.

I understand that the key metric is declared a combination of various factors, most notably the base activity of commits pulled from github - are we able to quantify that in numerical/measurable values?

I would prefer, personally to see some target values for community metrics as well. I understand this is plausibly challenging to nail down - but in 6 months time, we need to be able to look back and compare/contrast. This will also enable you to bring forward more informed proposals because you'll understand your own benchmarking quality early on. It evolves as it should.

Thus, I definitely agree with the laid out general terms for the KPIs. No problem there. Personally, I'm missing a concrete targets to ground the project onto accountability.  

Regardless, impressive work guys. Looks very professional already. My only remaining concern is getting it pushed through the fund round given relative size of the project and fund itself. There may be slight misalignment there. But, that's up to voters - not me. I am just a bystander.

Looking forward to your work guys - definitely one to watch.

Thank you for your efforts and time. Keep it up!

I appreciate your reply. Very much. I clearly see that you are committed to the project. However, I will press you a bit further. Hopefully, you won't mind.

The idea behind being able to formulate the proposal in such a way that can clearly articulate the intent of the requested funds is crucial. I understand that the actual app is very important. After all - that's what you are after - that working MVP.

However, this wouldn't be the first nor last project that focused too much on the app development and 'forgot' to give legs to the business side of things. Thus, if you are able to spare some bandwidth - this is a good time to do so.

If you don't have such capacity yourself presently - it may be useful to pause and re-evaluate. Maybe teaming up with someone who could pay attention to this business savvy side. I am not saying it is not possible to do it all - but you will be wearing yourself thin in the long run.

Just food for thought. I am looking forward how this project blossoms over coming weeks/months. Keep up the work.

14/Oct/20 3:13 PM,322288,1501,Vi2zz4rD,"@jbax  "" It makes no sense to target the current market price as it fluctuates wildly""  
Yes, but it also make no sense to estimate 1ADA = 0.08USD for the same reason :grinning:.  

Its new technology and it is what it is, so all proposers need to take the current price, or some small margin, because we all want to fund as much good proposals as we can.

If i understand correctly we have constant USD amount, and fluctuating ADA amount based on its price.  
So with situation like this, when price go up from 0.08 to 0.11 all proposers will need to adjust the estimation amount of ADA that they want to recive somewhere at the end of finalizing of the proposal stage.

Because the amount of ADA go significantly down, and it lower chance to fund as much good proposals as we want if they dont do that.

  
And i agree that it is uncomfortable with price changing all the time.

So i think good way is to let the community know how much USD will proposal need - convert it as ADA, and ask for that amount, and then adjust it at the end of the finalizing of proposal stage",NO

Thank you for your idea and the proposal. It definitely something that would catch up attention quickly.  

I appreciate your efforts greatly. However, it is my humble opinion that all these updates are better suited for off the platform and once all gathered to re-submit it entirely. Otherwise, one is unsure what to review if it isn't semi thought through at this point as we're heading into the next stage.

I really encourage you to keep asking the relevant questions as you have so far in order to get the answers. These will help fill in the void in the proposal so that it can have a good solid ground to build upon. It has a ton of merit - the idea itself. So it would be shame not to pursue it diligently.

And I think that's what will ultimately allow it to have bigger traction to take it all the way. More information makes better decisions and presentation.

Thank you for your proposal and the thought put into it.

I specially checked out the deck attached - very clear, concise, to the point.

I am surprised it hasn't picked up more traction till now. Hence, it makes me wonder. Few things that come to my mind - let's see if there is some merit to it.

Love the idea - but that's what it seems to be only so far. I think it would be helpful to bring in more tangibles. As in - what is your timeline like, what the proposed budget helps to accomplish. All I am getting is - we have an idea and we need this amount. But I don't know how to connect these dots yet.

In terms of 'selling' the idea. It may be useful to give a concise outline of what a storyboard could look like. Not specifics but something that voter can grasp onto. I think that would be super powerful in terms of getting this attention it could deserve.

I also see number of useful comments have been made by others. Don't forget to compile all of that and revise the proposal. Ensure the focus is lasered on the theme of the fund so that voters will understand the connection right away. This may be difficult task but crucial.

Thank you for your proposal. Very much appreciated.

I agree that tools like yours are vital to the ecosystem. And especially so if they are able to maintain neutrality and consensus across the system. This will be the most strategic focus that will determine whether and how users will interact with it in the future.

Therefore, I highly appreciate that you actually mention your existing relationships. Commendable and thank you for that.

I see you have the attached document. It is easier to read than the actual text in the proposal here. I think there is some formatting at fault in idescale text though. At the moment - it may not be easily readable as it is one giant text. I suggest editing/breaking up the text in the section above so make it easier to digest. You don't know if people will actually open attached document.

I have a brief comment about the timeline vs costs. It may be useful to break down the project 2 year development timeline down to the manageable chunks. I am thinking about how the voter will be looking at it. Funding something with a 2 year outlook all at once may be a bit stretchy at the moment. And also scary in terms of ada amount.

I am thinking - you could dilute it down to a 6 month cycle instead and project costs on that proportionally and then do another submission for Fund3 for the second leg, Fund4 for the another, etc. You can outline this in this project already which can show willingness for progress and accountability.

A - it may be easier to get funding through this way

B - will enable the voter to understand what you are requiring more tangibly.

What do you think?

14/Oct/20 2:20 PM,322195,1445,Daniel Ribar,"Helllo Rcmorano,

Thank you for the proposal. First let me mention the fact that it's great to see you have put a great deal of an effort into this proposal. Lots of relevant details. This is noticed and appreciated. Kudos.

I have few comments. First one is just technical and perhaps even not real. To be honest, I **have** done **it** few **times** myself. Too **much** use of **a bold typeface**. It has been pointed to me many times that it can be distracting to read lines when every other word is in bold. Again - maybe it was just the way I was typing something up. But I figured I'd pass on my experience with that. You don't wish to distract people from what you are trying to tell them. Could be fair point.

But back to proposal. I've noticed that you've split up the project in several phases. Given the funds requested to cover all would be a but overstretch. So that's good. Hence - I will pay attention to the first leg only:

*1.- First 3 months: first stage to set everything up and produce and integrate some example documentation (code snippets, boilerplates…) into whatever platform is decided to host the community service. Setup proper tools to gather relevant metrics and usage statistics (to be defined). In e.g., RPM (Requests Per Minute), success/error rates (HTTP OK/200…), usage per-endpoint (API+path) or documentation link hits.*  

Because this is directly tied to this funding round - it may be desirable to expand on the details of the roadmap 1st stage here and tone down the future ones in this particular instance. And then when new rounds comes - muting other stages and expanding the one that is currently considered for the funding proposal. If that makes sense. Will be easier for the voter to engage with the content that you are presenting them at that current stage.

With regards to funding - would make sense to make it absolutely clear how the figures came together. That's because there are multiples in different sections. So that there is no confusion how these link together. Just connecting dots better or presenting them in a table/bullet format may just do the trick. It currently reads a bit more like an essay than general budget.  
  
*""Current estimation for total costs at 18500ADA/epoch rate would make a total of 333000ADA for the first ~18 epochs (3 months).""*  

At any rate, this is super useful project and clearly falls into the subject matter of this funding round. Remember, community members will be voting at the end of the day. So just need to focus on how it will resonate with them and ensuring information reaches them concisely.

Looking forward how you work on this going forward. Keep up the great work.

14/Oct/20 1:23 PM,323632,1751,Daniel Ribar,"@chadattorus  Thank you Chad, for your detailed response. I think it outlines a lot of realities for you.

As it goes, vast majority of us in Cardano are in your kind of position - volunteering outside of normal working hours. Hence, thinking about this already gives you a better understand of what you need in order to deliver. Otherwise, it may turn into a never ending hobby, right?

Therefore, I highly appreciate you risking the current job to ensure that this project will get the attention it deserves. Kudos.

At this point - knowing this - it would be helpful to update the proposal with the budget that can support this in your best judgement. Then, breaking down individual budget items. If part is equipment - list the allocation. If part is your renumeration for time spent working on this project - list the allocation.

It is about ensuring that you keep eyes open on the project as time goes on. In the future, you will be then able to look back and re-examine steps taken forward. If you don't set these metrics early on - may be difficult to keep navigating where you wish to go without wasting your time and resources.

Lastly, try to articulate the connection with the fund2 challenge them in the opening few lines of the proposal. You don't wish someone not to vote for it just because they can't connect the dots. Connect these for them!

More likely the questions about budget and specific responsibility would just hang in their mind, unasked & uninvestigated.

I believe my response to you contains the best knowledge anyone can have at this time about the schedule, budget, and fields of responsibility. So I'm moving it into the proposal as you suggested, and also editing my original comment to you to help people avoid duplication of reading effort.

All the other comments I believe are included adequately in the links to the related CIP for Stake Pool URIs. Trying to duplicate every scrap of information there in the text of the proposal itself would be too much.

Finally I rephrased the title of this proposal (without the technical term URI) to make it easier to recognise, and see the value of, from a distance.

I'm not going to tailor-make the description to the Fund2 goals, because if the title & premise themselves don't capture the imagination & desire of the Cardano user, stake pool operator, developer, and investor, then nothing else matters. :heart_eyes:

Appreciate your response. Your work you're putting into the thought process is evident. Please, keep up the spirit!

I understand that the process of getting down the basics is not easy. However, you wish to invoke confidence in voters that you know what you are after and that you have done proper due diligence. It doesn't help when proposal reads: *""Uncertain about what tech stack are we going to use for the client, would need to talk with developers.""* I think it would make sense to talk to some already to get a good understand of what is required. Otherwise, you are left with guesswork. Also what was cost factor *""several years ago""* is not a sufficient price reference point in today's terms.

Further, it would be good idea to break down your grand budget against a specific timeline. I fear that the 'uncertainty' of the proposal is also partially due to absence of such specifics - language is often vague as hinted already.

When I mentioned point A and point B analogy - you've replied *""Then from point A to point B we literally take less than a day.""* But before that one days grand transition period happens - a lot of steps need to take place prior. So point A is actually way in advance. Thus that's where your real work starts.

How do you feel about that?

So as hinted in other comments, would be ideal to now compile the useful feedback and transform it into proposal itself. Many people may not read all the comments at all.

Looking forward how you work on this further. Keep up the great work.

Do you have a sample of the ""Cardano-centric"" work to give the community an idea of what will be produced?

A simple link to a 2 minute video explainer will be very helpful in determining the quality and overview of your proposal.

  

Although the idea of a Spanish show sounds great, there are many other content proposals on Catalyst and some of them have been producing content for over a year -- without funding.

  

As a content producer myself, voters may look at other creator proposals that have a track record when asking for such large sums, upfront.

  

My suggestion: Blow us away with a 2 minute sizzle reel and let us know what the funds will be used for.

Shows

Length

Reach

KPIs

Metrics

Return on Invested Funds

  

We want more shows as a global community...hopefully you can give us more detail on ""Why Galborta?""

14/Oct/20 10:03 AM,322288,1501,Jeronimo Backes,"@ezrg1  The idea of this work is to enable the cardano blockchain to be used for e-commerce, not necessarily the ADA token to be used as currency (even though it's called a crypto**currency**).

Once stable coins and other tokens are running on the blockchain, they will be able to be used for online payments from the get-go as the integrations will be ready.

At this super early stage I believe we'll only see enthusiasts using this for buying/selling things online. But very importantly, they will be testing it, requesting features and helping things to improve and mature.

Eventually when all major integrations are ready with most payment use cases and requirements covered, we can start exploring a few ideas such as:

\- provide a webstore platform such as shopify itself. I can even help to automate the importing all pages, liquid code and data from a shopify store to help them move out of it.  

\- try to tackle buyer/seller protections. Hopefully smart contracts can be used to help here.

\- selling to regular mom-and-dad consumers using regular FIAT credit cards but paying the online store in ADA.

Hope this helps you understand that the effort here is to allow adoption and utility of the blockchain to take place. Again, this has very little to do with the ADA token specifically: we'll simply start with ADA because that's the only token running on cardano.

  

In addition, a payment gateway that charges no fees allows sellers to accumulate ADA without paying fees required to convert fiat to ADA. On the other side of the transaction, those who want to cash out can avoid paying fees required to convert ADA to fiat. Reducing fees also helps sellers to add discounts to product prices bought in ADA, which could in turn stimulate new people to buy in.",NO
14/Oct/20 8:26 AM,322288,1501,Jeronimo Backes,"@vi2zz4rd  I've been thinking about it. It makes no sense to target the current market price as it fluctuates wildly and we can't know if the price will move back down to 4 cents or something, or jump further to 15 cents. It would be easier on everyone if instead of requesting funds in ADA we could request these in USD. Alternatively, knowing 200K USD are going to be spent, the funds available should based on a known amount of ADA (2 million ADA for example), priced at some price which everyone can reference to instead of a future price.",NO
14/Oct/20 7:45 AM,323717,1759,"Miguel ""Why Cardano"" ","@daniel.ribar  Alrighty…the deets. Let's do it.

1\. Finances: Sustainability will be explored after the costs have been incurred the first month of managing the guild. (January)

a. A combination of amazon referral links (easy way of subsidizing the guild via content creator gear purchases), DC funds and C funds.

b. Our focus is on getting the assemblage and feasibility stage complete in December and then rolling it out in January to ""determine how to sustain it""

2\. Content Creators are currently engaged in trying to get funded on their own ideas.

a. Meanwhile, the issue funding problem remains…how many of them will get the typical request for ~$15,000 when this fund only has $200k? -- and plenty of tech builds to consider.

b. This need will naturally become more prominent after Fund 2…hence the guild-build during December 2020 in order to front-run the ""oh, I want to have a podcast"" surge of 2021. :studio_microphone:

3\. Performance-based funding will serve as the checks/balances for this guild. You perform --> you get funds.

a. New creators = startup funds after solid proposal and sample content

b. Established creators = KPIs + Metrics-based approach to continued funding.

  

To your final point:

Politics is part of the human experience, it's what allows us to align millions of people behind a story…like Cardano. Furthermore, it's probably reasonable that the manager(s) of the guild will not be able to receive funding for content -- due to the conflict of interest. This should relax the posturing that may be expected.

  

Our channel's aim is to streamline the funding/content politics and bring it closer to meritocracy.

Perform --> Funding.

This project's scope would need to widen and the research scope would need to be far narrower to increase likelihood of successful implementation.

Project scope - more robust process. Research alone is unlikely to address the challenge effectively. It might be a good start, but is just that, only a start of the process to ""encourage developers and businesses to build on top of Cardano in the next 6 months. I'd encourage a plan from the outset on a second phase on how to use the results of the research.

Research scope - Your current research scope is: What developers love or hate about their current blockchain. That is far too wide a research question to return actionable insights. You'll need to chop that scope down to a relatively microscopic level in order make your research deliver results in a short timeframe. I suggest do more research upfront.

But I also see that regulation is a process liable to corruption and inhibition of competition / free market. Regulators have used the excuse that Bitcoin is widely used to promote criminal activities, finance terrorists and money laundering, when it is known that there are studies indicating that fiat currencies are the preferred method for committing crimes.

Regulation did not prevent banks from committing crimes by practicing spoofing in the gold market. Regulation did not stop several banks from laundering billions $. Regulators have banned cryptocurrencies in some countries. Regulators banned gold ownership in the USA decades ago.

I also think we should again highlight that Prism's utility will serve as a defacto streamlined kyc/aml process for the traditional finance banks/regulators so protocols such as Liqwid that use Prism for proof of identity are in many ways helping these players. I guarantee you when the case study is completed 5 years from now the DeFi protocols built on Cardano will stand the test of time because compliance was baked into the core of the protocols (Prism) in comparison to the Ethereum DeFi equivalents that have mostly 0 notion of identity or compliance (KYC/AML) checks.

  

Our team is all about identifying all of the actors, going through the game theory simulations and considering what each actor has to gain and lose with the introduction of Liqwid (this is one of the first deep analysis our team performed when testing the viability of this protocol) compared to the current value chain and set of incumbent players. It's certainly why our protocol plans to be fully decentralized from the very start: all users of the protocol will receive governance token as a ratio of their provided liquidity and thus become the owner's of the protocol.

There will be no CEO or Board of directors for Liqwid. Only developers, builders and users based around the world.

As far as skills, I've spent 2-4 hours a day, fairly consistently, studying things related to programming language design for the last 15 years (I started programming in QBasic when I was 12). I know a little bit about the features of a lot of different programming languages. My favorite language is probably Elm, in which I'm highly confident in my skill level.. I've also spent a lot of time reading Haskell code.. mostly the Elm compiler. I think Elm is a good place to start teaching, because of it's notoriously helpful compiler messages. It's like Haskell, but simpler. I don't have a lot on my Github page (mostly silly little Elm apps), but I'll link it to my proposal.

There are a few available Plutus tutorials that I've gone through to gain a basic understanding of its use for smart contracts and I've gotten the Plutus Core evaluator (**plc**) compiled and running on my machine to do some testing. I'm planning to port **plc** to the Pony language when I've got the time and I'll use the Haskell version for parity checking. Pony is a Object-Oriented/Actor-Model language, but it eliminates runtime errors with its strong algebraic type system and reference capabilities. It's good for distributing low-latency code across all your cores, and since it's garbage collection happens at the actor level, there's no stop-the-world GC, like you'll find in GHC.. which concerns me for some of the applications I want to work on… the physics system I'm planning for my game idea.. I want to incorporate Plutus (in some form) as a scripting language in-game and interface with Cardano to store game-state hashes as snapshots of the system as well as player inventories, etc… This is a bigger and longer-term plan than the scope of the **Fund2 Challenge.**

My main goal here is trying to establish a presence of Cardano in Malawi, see where it fits in the economy, and cultivate a teaching and learning culture that could help people start thinking of innovative solutions for their problems at home, as well as giving access to a global source of income. I have many ideas of my own that I'd like some help with after training some people, but I'm more interested in getting people to the place where they know enough about available technologies to develop innovative ideas of their own. That sort of thing requires taking less control and giving people the opportunities to be in charge of their own project ideas. There's a lot of rote memorization in the Malawian education system today. I ask a friend about some technology and get a snippet of a Wikipedia article back.. not as innovative as I was hoping for*(sigh)*.",https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/idea/326881/32973/download

Thank you both for the suggestions!

Firstly, because this is a new idea so feedback from the on-demand content will help me gain insights into what needs to be improved/removed/included etc..

13/Oct/20 8:35 PM,322338,1517,Liqwid Labs,"@rodrigopacini  Sure and this is a very interesting scenario you are describing:

The first error you are not considering is we have examples of DeFi Lending protocols on Ethereum today, the USA already knows Americans are using them without KYC and absolutely nothing has been done in terms of enforcement.

Also I think you are confusing the exposure of developers building a borrow/lending market with a protocol that enables the trading of derivatives. The former is akin to a payday lending bank app (Compound) the latter is BitMEX (Uniswap, dydx). Basically polar opposites I think you are not fully considering in your scenario.

Unless the U.S. (or any other authoritarian nation) decides to start banning all lending apps in their borders (both CeFi and DeFi) I expect Liqwid to be accepted and viewed as a web3 alternative to current incumbents. Not at all different to the current options; regulators in these nations understand any citizen with an eth wallet views the current DeFi Lending protocols as their web3 alternative to the CeFi equivalents.

This proposal directly targets the challenge and focuses on defi, which is really heating up and attracting a lot of interest. This would be good to get developers in the crypto space to try and build something in Cardano.

A hackathons is a fantastic way to engage people and can expand the cardano ecosystem by creating minimally viable projects that have a chance to take off and become something real in the world.

My recommendation is to structure the proposal itself to focus less on the the idea of a hackathon and more on the strategy and potential outcomes (the KPIs). The idea summary makes sense to describe a hackathon and identify the expected outcomes/KPIs, but the plan leaves me with the following questions:  

1) Most of the funding for the hackathon will NOT come from the catalyst funds. How will you build a prize pool or incentives that will attract highly motivated and talented developers to the hackathon?

2) Any initial thoughts on how you would communicate and attract developers to the event? How will they find out about it? Is ADA a strong incentives or are there stronger incentives for developers who might not even know much about crypto to jump in and try to build something?

3) What are the predictive metrics that tell you before the event that your hacakthon is looking like it will be successfull?

4) What are the success metrics that tell you after the event that your hackathon had an impact on the ROI of this Fund2 challenge?",NO

Thank you for the follow up. I just looked up on the proposal, and bravo - it's miles ahead where it's been. I can especially appreciate that you have narrowed down the focus. This is important. One will often get distracted by all the possible ""what ifs"" and fall over the first step. By you taking that zoom into the initial phase and adjusting proposal - it starts to make more sense.

And to be honest - it starts being less intimidating for you as a proposal owner because now you are really getting to understand nuts and bolts of how you will get from point A - today - to point B - your end goal.

I appreciate the added budget. It would be ideal to interpret costs a bit clearer. I see different phases have very similar break down of costs. Granted - some are recurring. However, it would be ideal to highlight additional purchases - because it isn't intimately clear at first. You're planning to build inventory of hardware as you grow. Correct? And as you do - you buy more of the same stuff, right?

I've noticed your conversation with Yuta. I like your answers but would you be also give a more specific expectation how quickly you plan to be self-sustainable? At least - I understood - it is the actual goal, right? It would be good for you to have a good understanding what a sustainability plan looks like. It may not be important in the initial pilot phase - we're trying to prove the concept works - but eventually it will come to play.

One last note - somewhat related with above. What are some of the concerns that won't let you sleep at night until this project is truly off the ground. Have you thought about why this project may not be successful and what you can do early to minimise that possibility?

Again, as I mentioned previously, this really looks like a fantastic opportunity to get the community growing. I can see that you are motivated and eager to put in the work.

Keep it up and I am really looking forward seeing this grow. Heck - one day - perhaps - even paying a visit.

Thank you for your interesting proposal. Very appreciated.

I have tried to get a sense of it but before even getting into bones of budgets and timelines - I am still unsure how this app will work. In the world of the digital ecosystem - where does it land? Is this an app that needs to be installed atop existing solutions? Along side them? Entirely new?

See - the presentation hasn't triggered imagination to buckle down how it will work in real time. I've seen the web-site and the screenshots - yet I am still in a limbo. Don't mind me - it could be just my ignorance of some dots. However, I may need some help connecting them. So I apologise if it is somewhere obvious. However, some real case usage walk through - such as Charles's AMA could be useful. I don't see it just yet.

Other that - I see good attempt at detailing some sort of timeline and budget. I think it would be useful to see the funds against timeline to see the burn rate of the proposal. It will also enable you to benchmark the progress more effectively.

Have you also thought about how you will measure the utility of this app? As in - I'm looking to have this much engagement on the platform. Or X amount of users active? Or will it be defined in the ADA transacted? Probably good questions to think around.

So this is on my mind presently. Really looking forward to understanding this a bit better. Keep up the good work.

Thank you for your detailed response. Very much appreciated.

With regards to the finances - I am curious - how do you plan to reach sustainability. OR is there any expectation to be fully funded on continuous basis from the dFunds? What's the general direction there.

I've hinted about accountability earlier. Appreciate your answers. Wondering - is there a founding quorum already or is this prior engagement yet? Meaning - who will be establishing the guild initially? Are there content creators already on board with this idea - that have hinted interest in helping build this up - or is this your sole initial endeavour and the rest is ready to unroll.

Further, I particularly love the best practices section that you have worked out. I think it will excite young and upcoming content creators to get that guidance early. With regards to this point - how do you feel barrier to entry will equalise down the line? What are some thoughts of yours on checks and balances regarding behaviour of big well established 'media' empires vs. a kiddo who just posted their first Cardano video.

Thank you for your time and effort with the proposal.

Unfortunately, I share the similar sentiments with other colleagues in other comments. I am unsure if you've had a good opportunity to work more on this proposal. I am unsure it has enough detail that would warrant deeper discussion. I like the idea but I have no means of understanding the feasibility of this project.

Generally, things I would look for is understanding your budget, your timeline, and measurable goals. If you were to come in the future funds, and I certainly hope you will, please try to think about these prior. It will help people understand a bit better.

In case you're not pursuing funds in this round anymore - it would be useful to edit the title to include WITHDRAWN.

Thank you for the follow up. Much appreciated.

Generally, I really like the idea. But it still seems a bit ungrounded so far. I see you've narrowed down the budget into two broad categories. However, it raises some concern. It would be ideal to have a good understanding what team size are you really looking for. It is not often helpful to present multiple plans within one plan. I'd like to see a firm direction which you think has the best utilisation of funds. Otherwise - we are looking at many parallel outcomes. It is good to consider them holistically - but shouldn't be a goal. The idea is to laser focus a plan and set it up specifically.

E.g. you either wish to employ team of 5 or team of 10. Why? Because that can vastly skew the performance of the project as a whole.

I have also picked up a bit on what Steve has touched upon. The very last paragraph above says *'first few months...figure out a good strategy.""* I feel this is crucial information. It either suggests that the scope of the project itself needs to be adjusted to better reflect its outcome OR to actually try to determine what this strategy be prior.

Otherwise - figuratively - we may not really know where the project is headed. If that makes sense. It's okay to be fluid but not at the expense of measurable accountability.

At any rate - looking forward how you work in this further. Keep it up!

13/Oct/20 4:32 PM,323781,1768,Daniel Ribar,"Hello Galborta,

Thank you for your proposal. Much appreciated.

I see some of the concerns have been picked up by the comments from others. My observation still stands around the budget. I second the sentiment's of some here that it looks professional enough already. And hence the ""lower"" cost is due to the availability of existing equipment that you don't have to purchase. Is my reasoning somewhat right?

Having said that - it wouldn't hurt to create a sample budget so that we can remove guess work above entirely. I've noticed you spoke about the timeline and cadence of episodes as well. It would be worth adding this crucial information directly into your proposal because it can get lost in the comments section.

Given the latest sentiments on social media about podcasts - try to address the potential worries of people who may come prejudiced into the voting. Think about ways how you can communicate your uniqueness of podcast proposal firmly.

Hopefully, you can work on some further details to add more meat onto the proposal. Think of it this way. You are trying to explain the audience how are you going to get from point A (today) to where you wish to go (point B) and why it is worth their consideration and vote.  

To conclude - I would love to have a high energy podcast in another language than English. While I think there are a lot of podcasts in general - language specific domains is something that Cardano can definitely bank on more. And you don't have to tell me twice about Spanish passion. it comes out in the communication and I always enjoy it.

Looking forward how this develops further and wishing you best of luck!

Thank you for the follow up. Much appreciated.

I think what I struggle with is the following. Do you think 3 months is enough of time for the council to achieve objectives? If so - what sorts of objectives do you think are most reasonable. I know - this may be hard to imagine but here is why I am curious about it.

What if the council has, figuratively speaking, nothing to show for within the first 3 months time frame - and hence is unable to secure additional funding. What's the plan then? How do we prove voters that this is worth funding again? That's why elections in the real world are not very frequent to allow for establishment of a track record first.

Again - I am just approaching it from the operational perspective more than substance per se. I am not sure how the allocated funds can actually achieve its objectives. I am missing the sense of sustainability.

Thank you for your thorough additions into the proposal.

I had the opportunity to watch the Gauntlet episode featuring your project. This is not directly tied with the proposal - but I figured it could be of a use for the future. It may help to rehearse how to counter-react question to which you may not have immediate answers on the spot. Especially, when presenting such a highly technical project where a single comment/question can derail thought flow entirely. Usually, a set of pre-mediated neutral answers can do a good trick. Politicians/public figures do this 'training' all the time in order to avoid live camera issues. Just an idea.

Further, it helps to have a ""back up"". I would even consider having - next time - two people on the same camera. Including your CTO to help fill in the gaps. That way you get two heavy weights in one go. I felt a bit uneasy at some points per all the comments coming your way.  

Having said that - actually - following up on many questions raised during that interview is highly commendable. I applaud you for the willingness to do it in the end. Thank you for that effort. Not many would have the motivation or desire to do after the interview. Kudos. :)

On my other observation - I agree that the proposal is highly technical. And I will not pretend I know nuts and bolts of what you are talking about precisely. However, from a general business proposal perspective - I am having troubles identifying budget requirements as such. I see a grand figure was allocated but it gives me no confidence in determining how it plays into the bigger picture. It would help to break down the cost of the project into manageable chunks over certain periods of time.

That will help you also to navigate the benchmarking more effectively. I understand that your project is not dependant on Cardano funding as such but it would be still good to see that effort.

Again, I appreciate your time you've taken to tackle all the comments coming back at you. Bravo. Keep up the great work and I am looking forward learning more about the whole RINA concept.

Hello Franco,

Thank you. The revised budget looks a lot better now. Much appreciated. I think it also allowed you more to think about about details relevant to your efforts.

I noticed you've mentioned about loss of collar - like through the weight-loss, etc. Indeed, collars can break apart, damage, etc. However, let's not forget that a human can take it off from them all together. If someone finds a dog, removes the collar - then, that's a 'fresh' dog to be re-adopted elsewhere. If that makes sense. Hence, my thinking about implanted chips as potentially a more lasting solution.

Lastly, do you think stake pool operation/funding is a reliable source of income? We can already see how difficult it is to maintain the delegation and commitment from delegators. I think that's something to consider by some margin.

Thank you for your constructive comments Daniel,

I will try and rearrange the proposal before closing hours today.

About the sustainability. Yes, we suspect to be self-funded. As you might remember, the operational costs are covered by 13.96% of the wager stakes. This means that the funding (and increasing) of the salesforce is based upon their own success. For the monthly salary we need 50.000 ADA (approx, since the ADA is increasing). That is half of the operational cost. Since we have 4 Wallet-lotteries a month (approx.), we need only to cover 25.000 per Wallet-lottery. With 180.000 weekly participants, we already cover that.

However, we aim at 2M participants. Meaning also that we want to increase the salesforce dramatically the moment the first costs are covered.

Important note: the percentages mentioned will all be discussed and voted upon. I can imagine a higher contribution to the treasury. The current 0.04% is based upon the original funding of 400,000ADA in relation to the 10,000,000ADA investing/pledging.

I will also add this comment to the proposal.

It seems it is well thought through. However, I am still unable to wrap my head around funding. Perhaps, I am just missing a point. However, didn't get to the bottom of it in either attachments, comments, or proposal itself.

Would you be able to draft a sample budget that can address how each stage of your process will be funded? I understand that you have a week by week timeline. I am not convinced yet that the funding requested is tied well with it.

On another note - have you thought about how will you judge the effort in the end? Say - week 16 - product is finished. What are your expectations of it thereafter? Is it number of developers? What's the general idea of getting the word out there for the app to be actually used? I see a lot has been spent on the development side.

I can also see value in other comments posted here. However, one still stands out for me personally.

I think it is fantastic that you are thinking with regards to KPIs. In fact, you have come up with many of them. However, these are still just an open ended questions. It would help to attach some numerical values to them so that you can keep track of progress on your own. Otherwise, you may not know what to are you benchmarking yourself against.

\-- 50 commits weekly

*How many developers are currently creating funded tasks?*

\-- keeping at least 10 active developers

This may explain why it feels like the question; ""what Scale is required for proper analytics?"" is not addressed. I read your Q2 report, and see a general overview of Lending Product valuations and analytics across several quarters. This is wonderful information, is it derived from your data at the blockchain addresses level, or is it aggregated reported data from the lenders?

I appreciate your thought process on getting these streamlined. Remember, more readable the proposal is - the higher chance or voter's approval it will have regardless of what these comments are up to these days. I don't think you need to add our names to your proposal - as long as you edit it accordingly. :)

One additional thought - how long before this is sustainable on its own? I am wondering as proposal suggests hiring additional 50 people. Do you expect to be self-funded and how quickly? Namely in regards to what happens if the fund money runs out and the employment of such a large group of people.

What's the plan in such a scenario? This is more of a hypothetical.

Much appreciated. However, I am still hazy on budget details. Have you been able to work on some sensible breakdown yet? It could be me just missing it somewhere but I figured checking with you first would be idea.

I did review the attached document - but it is too busy to be able to quickly connect the dots. Would you be able to create a more streamlined version of the deck to get to the key metrics quicker? Down to 10 slides or less? It has 45 at the moment and unsure if all are highly relevant for the present round. Remember - voters will need to understand your project in a jiffy as they make their way through the candidates.

Also - forgive me my ignorance - but entire document does not mention ADA or Cardano a single bit. So I am unable to determine what the currency R is especially either.

Thank you in advance - really an interesting and good use case for blockchain. Looking forward to understanding it better.

Thank you for your proposal. Internally, I fancy it very much. Wouldn't that be nice, citizen of Cardano nation.

However, I think there are many obstacles and risks associated with such a proposal. Setting up a micronation is not an easy task. I happen to know the president of Liberland, a Czech who has been trying to do this with his concept of no man's land in the balkans for the past several years. It has been quite cumbersome to say the least.

So my question, before anything else, do you truly believe this is even feasible and worth al the trouble? Legally? Curious if this is a viable opportunity or just an entertainment factor per se.

Thank you for coming back to me with your thorough follow up. Very much appreciated.

At this point - I feel like the project may be out of scope with the theme of the fund challenge - which is how to attract more developers on board within 6 months. Based on that alone - I would suggest to keep working on this project and re-introduce it at the later stage when

A: fund is considerably larger

B: fund is easier to match with the proposal in terms of scope

Till then - that would give you enough time to think it all through with detail as well as gather all the input that you've mentioned are still waiting on. There is nothing wrong with ambitious plans - but they also need to be actionable and accountable. It helps to create specific milestones that can help you keep accountable towards you as well.

Again, that's just my subjective opinion. If you do decide to pause the proposal - adding WITHDRAWN into the title may help differentiate it from the lot very quickly.

At any rate - would be exciting to have you back at some point.

Thank you for the hard work on the updates.

I have one lingering thought - which is more of an afterthought. The idea is using these funds to help you add more manpower to the project. Does this mean that person will be then employed only for this specific project and its duration? What are your plans after the completion? Would the person be simply paid off per project or a direct hire?

Why I am asking - because if this is going to be just per project - you would be able to bill contract value. Because now, I also see related social charges in your budget.

What are your guidelines on these?

Thank you for the follow up. Appreciated.

As I see it - from the voter's perspective - you will face issues with understanding how this related to the existing IOG efforts for the converter. You've mentioned in your reply that it is a 'new concept at all, not connected to IOG at all.""

One selling point in my perspective would also be - how much faster and reliably would you be able to implement this alternative to IOG converter. Because - see - I still struggle understanding where on the map does this converter sit vs. IOG's.

Thus - it would make sense to include this clear distinction in the proposal itself. That will likely help you narrow down the focus for the observers and eliminate confusion/doubts.

1 USA prohibits American users from using Liqwid, as some American users are using Liqwid without KYC.

2 Liqwid is a decentralized protocol and there is no way to prohibit this, because to limit access to American users they would have to put some barrier to American IPs in the code. Even if Liqwid decides to sacrifice part of its decentralization and censor IPs from accessing the protocol, any anon can fork and continue.

3 USA realizes that its ban has no effect and American users continue to use Liqwid without KYC.

Our proposal under the aforementioned budget consists of an initial period of 6 months (24 episodes). This results in 1 episode per week with an average length of approximately 30 to 45 minutes long.

The program will be composed of debates and interviews with prominent figures that can enlighten our community. We will discuss the commercial benefits and uses of blockchain technology as well as how this technology can be beneficial for developing economies and how entrepreneurs, developers and businesses can get involved with the cardano community.

Thank you for your feedback!",NO
13/Oct/20 1:47 AM,322338,1517,Liqwid Labs,"@rodrigopacini  Hey Rodrigo, glad I could provide some clarifications here. We will also be releasing a short demo video of Liqwid's Marlowe built smart contracts for the United Nations hackathon and I think this will provide additional clarity in terms of the system design, contract functions and general architecture of the Liqwid protocol.

So I also want to be clear about this point as you have brought up user privacy is one of the most important factors to building a protocol with Liqwid's functionality. I am not saying that everyone who uses the Liqwid network will need to have completed KYC, I believe firmly this should be an option the user decides depending on their region, laws, risk/op-sec levels, etc. Obviously a user who has completed Prism KYC/AML and has their linked social data will have a much more complete set of data points by which a credit risking model can accurately price their risk compared to a complete anon user. Both can still access and use Liqwid protocol. Yes there are several intricate components to how this works from a data science standpoint under the hood and I am giving a very high level gloss over these concepts (but from the examples you bring up above I am sure you understand how protocols like Credmark, Tellor, and other defi credit focused protocols operate).

So two things: 1. When DeFi protocols like Liqwid integrate with Atala Prism we are actually helping central banks implement the kyc/aml functions there banks are struggling to keep up with now. 2. Also as I eluded to earlier user's who would like to access loans will have significantly more attractive loan terms/lower fees when they have completed the Prism based KYC/AML process steps via linking their government issued ID to their account. Again keep in mind even these users maintain complete privacy via zkProofs (they can attest to any of their personal information without revealing their identity).

The issue of the amount of funding requested is a bit of a challengeIt amounts to very close to 50% of the available funding in Fund2.

Once there are some metrics that you can provide you might consider returning on a later round for additional funds.

The fact is that the refund would not be ""from Sebastian..."" ! Seba would never have had the funds, they would be in the smart contract, and awaiting some event for disbursement or return. That simple mistake in the UI could totally mess up the concept in folk's thinking about it.

I agree, the proposal lacks information, unfortunately that's the problem. I have no data on the viability of the idea. It requires extensive research to determine if its even possible to meet the initial goals. As a result I have been having difficulty finding a way to propose funding the research necessary to study the question to see if the end goal is even viable.  
  
The idea is really in the ""elevator talk"" phase, lacking in specific information. The general idea is that if a telescope can be built out of ""off the shelf"" components for USD200,000 with a reliable design life of 5 years, and if there is a market to keep that telescope operating for 5 years continuously, at a price of USD300 per hour, the model is profitable.  
  
The questions I need to research are; can a viable telescope be built in that budget? What are the development Costs? What are the system requirements? What telescope and cameras does the market demand? How much of the market can one satellite serve while remaining within budget? Is there sufficient market to keep the satellite operating regularly enough to justify the cost? And also of strong importance, how many satellites need to be built to ameliorate the average build cost down to the figures required to become profitable, and is there a market for that many satellites?  
  
As for meeting the challenges of Fund2, the best way in my opinion, to meet the challenge of Fund2 is to start developing the DApps necessary to use Cardano as the primary point of sale and access control mechanism for real world applications.

12/Oct/20 6:51 PM,322338,1517,Liqwid Labs,"@michal.petro  The total cost estimates of this project can easily be extrapolated by the budget we have provided if you can use a calculator. The entire point of Catalyst are continuous funding rounds where protocol teams are able to return with community updates on their progress towards launching their dApp/SDK/whatever they are building.

The roadmap is a high level overview of our plans through MVP deployment. You are trying to compare that to a Gantt chart that is highlighting the activities/tasks for the planning, analysis, and design stages (I am not sure how that makes any logic and the Gantt chart is a draft timeline as highlighted until we get final dates from IOHK on the fund2 timeline). So yea obviously the two do not match one is a draft timeline for the 3 phases leading up to development the other is a high level roadmap through v1 launch.

Our team (as well as several others will certainly request funding in future rounds), again you can use a calculator to multiply the amount requested for this round by the timeline to our MVP deployment if you want an estimate of what our development budget requests will be in future rounds. A draft timeline is subject to change and very different than a finalized project schedule (which no one has until IOHK approves timelines).

As a management consultant who works with software developers daily I am skeptic about your understanding of what it takes to deploy an MVP (especially when our core devs have already developed all of the base smart contracts in Marlowe and completed early protocol architecture/design for the protocol). You are speaking from your very subjective opinion and failing to account for what an entire team of senior software engineers with experience building similar protocols can develop in a given timeline. We have an integrated team of blockchain engineers, QA, Data devs, UI/UX, and audit teams.

Any software development professional as you call yourself who understands the basics around Agile development teams and the type of SDLC method deployed on Agile software projects understands that developer cadence and 2 week sprint structures are a proven method to implementing secure, well tested applications in a compressed timeline. I am not only Agile certified I work every single day (including right now) on large scale software implementations that employ the exact same Agile method our development teams will use to deliver Liqwid. Proven processes > subjective experience

***Per your roadmap you plan to launch Liqwid token on 11/20 - it this going to be a token sale? on which blockchain do you plan to launch? if this will be a token sale, why would you need additional funding for the project from Catalyst fund?***  

There will absolutely not be a token sale and if you read the entire roadmap you can clearly see an Airdrop to the Liqwid protocol users will begin once the Liqwid v1 protocol launches on Plutus testnet.

We are launching 100% on Cardano rails and using a governance method to become 1. completely decentralized/self-sufficient and 2. produce a governance token tied to the Liqwid Protocol's future growth (and owned by the users of the protocol, not some VC's who got in early during a token sale)",NO

Unfortunately, I have to concur with colleagues - we're missing a lot of tangible information about this project to take it seriously at the moment. I see where you are heading with it but we'll need to see more information provided.

Hello David,

Thank you for your addition. That's very useful. I appreciate adding the mention for both text and visual. You may like to make better correlation between the two. The graphic talks about ALPHA, BETA, etc. - but I don't see the match up with the proposal text itself. So it may be a little confusing. Maya also help adding a time stamp to them so that you can hold yourself accountable to see if you are on track. This should be pretty straightforward for you, I trust.

I've looked back but I can't really say I understand the financing part much yet. I know now - that the biggest portion would be utilised to hiring talented developers to come aboard (mentioned in the comment above). Is my sensing right? I think that could then be easily broken down and visualised. Numbers don't need to be equal but you should have a firm understanding of what costs lay ahead of you - so that you can feel out what resources you'll need to deploy to make this get from A to B successfully.

Again, thank you for your time working on this project. I always appreciate when a real business takes enough courage to turn their operations upside down for the benefit of their future.

I certainly wish you best of luck getting this ironed out. Will be exciting to see you progress.

Thank you for your hard work on the proposal.

12/Oct/20 6:22 PM,322325,1512,Daniel Ribar,"Hello Maria,

Just circled back to see the changes. Thank you for the wonderful additions you've made. Your efforts are highly appreciated.

I have few follow up thoughts. Looking at the proposal now, I see:

*METRICS*

*Number of views, geographic data, subscribers and how long are the people actually watching the videos*

I am unsure how to interpret these as measurable metrics. Do you have an understanding of what your goal is, where you wish to see yourself in the timelines that make sense to you?

Ideally -

*   we would like to grow the audience by X subscribers in Y amount of time.
*   we would like to have audience from X geographical areas in Y amount of time
*   we would like to have an average watch time to be between X and Y by Z timeframe.

  

Are these hard to nail exactly? Yes. Do they need to be extremely precise? Absolutely no. Why are these useful? It will serve you as a compass. Because - it will make you think about whether the goals you have in mind are attainable. And in turn allow you to grow even better in the future.

If you allocate goals appropriately - it will enable to draft a plan that will actually carry out. Otherwise, you may be stuck drifting from the course itself (even without realising it).

On another note, will this be purely a video output project? Or do you plan to add supplemental materials in addition to the video. My concern is - using video output only can potentially discourage a lot of potential and eager learners that would be interested in learning - but video doesn't work for them. Diversifying video output may help address some of those issues.

However, it depends on what your target zone is specifically. Do you have an idea about who your ideal target person is? If you were to go out on the street and could hand pick your subscribers/learners one by one - what would the most suitable traits you'd be searching for?

Looking forward to how this will project will blossom.

12/Oct/20 6:21 PM,322338,1517,Liqwid Labs,"@rodrigopacini  Hey Rodrigo I did not feel that way at all (and apologies if you felt I did), I am a consultant by day so very use to taking client feedback of all sorts and clarifying process/outcome/details. Again critiques are great they help us refine our concepts and think more deeply about process and key user UI/UX.

The specific stablecoin-linked feature Liqwid will offer in the uncollateralized loan space will be 1. completely decentralized and non-custodial (it is using the exact same pooling method to provision liquidity for the loans as Compound/Aave) 2. Tied to a user's zkProof privacy preserving Atala Prism address (KYC/AML out of the gate so by definition in compliance), 3. We already have strong equations that price out the default risk against the level of interest repaid on previous loan amounts meaning there will be significantly stronger incentives for borrowers to repay their loans + interest in our protocol (in ways DeFi has simply never implemented in this design before). As a domain expert in both finance and DeFi dApps it's clear 98% of DeFi is actually just CeFi wrapped in decentralization theater. Liqwid means decentralized banking/data ownership for every person engaging with the protocol. The entire point of setting up a DAO structure, protocol treasury and governance structure that places the ownership of the protocol in every user's governance vote means the scenario you highlight above will never impact Liqwid (or any other decentralized protocol with a team of private individuals around the world). The reason BitMEX is getting rekt is because they allowed Americans to margin trade securities on their CeFi platform w/out proper KYC/AML. That will certainly not be the case with Liqwid.

Teller is just integrating with CeFi credit databases to calculate a credit score, not that innovative, not tested at all in terms of product market fit and they're not even live yet they just received seed funding. Our team is already partnering with data science teams at startups and tech shops like IBM to implement components of their algo-optimized credit scoring products already in production (some for years). Credmark is the start for what will become an in-house developed complete credit scoring model that accounts for unique data points beyond someone's CeFi credit score (2/3 of the world don't even have these) or their onchain activity (Credmark).

You do realize Aave's credit delegation is nothing like a credit scoring product similar to traditional finance credit scores. Also our team has already reviewed all of these model's and will be implementing a credit vouching feature similar to the Aave credit delegation (and it will be even more robust since it 1. takes into account an algo calculated credit score, 2. allows any individual to become a mini-credit union once they have built a strong credit score and 3. our model does not rely on other protocols such as OpenLaw in the case of Aave credit delegation, less smart contract/arbitration failure risk)

You say you follow DeFi but no protocol \*at all\* on Ethereum has implemented the DeFi protocol with the design we are using. I sent you a DM on Twitter happy to jump on a call and go through our complete protocol design and architecture, protocol math and other incentive mechanisms (game theory) that underpin Liqwid.

***I got confused with the term airdrop because you put an image of the roadmap where it says airdrop, maybe that needs to be clearer.***

This is fair and I will talk to our team about clarifying this language. Right before the words you are quoting though it clearly says v1 Liqwid launch which I think makes it clear the actual users of the protocol will be receiving the tokens as a means of engaging with the Liqwid protocol. More on this to come soon.

The VC's need to bring more than just money for us to consider allocating governance tokens to them. We already have a team of rockstar devs, development and integration partners.

I completely agree with your take on Oracle Pools; again there are several implementation details still to be de-risked with our development partners. That is what fund2 is all about for us before development start.

***You cited the costs for financing the project for 6 weeks at $ 36,500, but you also cited the monthly costs between $ 25,000 and $ 26,000 per month. It was not clear whether the project would need more funding (fund3).***

The monthly cost for the Appinventiv DeFi dApp devs is $25-26k after the first month that is correct. Liqwid (and several other dApp/developer SDK focused) proposals will request additional funding in future rounds as our projects progress. I thought that was the entire point of the funding rounds as well, to produce initial development and produce community progress reports and updates to continue raising development funds in future rounds.

***I am in favor of financing your project, but as I understand it Liqwid will need additional funds in the future, I think it is necessary to describe it more clearly, because if the community decides to finance this proposal, it has to understand that there will be a need for more funding in the future and that it would make no sense to spend an amount X now and give up supporting the project in the future. Obviously this also depends on the evaluation of what is done in the coming months.***

Again I want to make it clear there are several projects in fund2 building developer tooling/dApps that will all be requesting additional funds in later rounds. I do think continuous funding rounds and a move to a more Quadratic Voting based system should be explored more by the Cardano community in future rounds to better mitigate the point you highlight above.

***My criticisms were motivated by everything that I saw wrong in the DeFi projects at Ethereum, I hope we can have a safer and more rational development environment at Cardano.***  

Our team's entire founding ethos of Liqwid protocol was taking a step back and looking at the inefficiencies in not only current DeFi projects but the current CeFi lending options for retail consumers. It is our goal to produce a protocol on Cardano that not only secures capital and mitigates risk, but one that preserves user privacy and enables Liqwid users to become owners of the protocol.",NO
12/Oct/20 6:20 PM,322288,1501,Phil Lewis,"@jbax  I wasn't so much thinking of exactly the same process, but at least something that can be bundled with the blockchain process. I take your point about the security side of it, so maybe something to enable on the relay nodes which are publicly accessible.

I think at the end of the day there are potentially a lot of idle cycles on some servers that could be utilised. When smart contracts hit, I would expect this might also be something SPOs will be looking to support.",NO
12/Oct/20 6:06 PM,322241,1477,mike,"@shapiro21  We can expand the documentation on the site but here is a brief summary of your specific questions:  
  
1\. ROS is compounded interest. For we take the ratio of rewards (to delegators0) / pool stake. This gives us a percentage reward for the 5 day epoch. Then we expand to a full year (otherwise the numbers are very small and hard to grok) using a compounding interest formula.  
2\. Distribution graphs are given by statistical analysis for a given pools stake relative to overall stake. This defines the chances of a pool being a leader on any single particular slot. Then we extrapolate this using a binomial distribution to the number of expected blocks in the epoch given the total epoch slots. Realtime adjusted is the same thing, but it takes into account how many blocks you have already made in the epoch and how many ""chances"" (aka slots) remain in the epoch. You will notice the distribution narrows as we get close to the end of the epoch because there is less variability due to less chances.  
  
Consider the idea of a coin toss. Every toss you have a 50/50 chance of heads. If you plan to flip it 10 times, then you'd expect 5 heads, but wouldn't be surprised if you had 4 or 6, and occasionally you'd probably see 3 or 7 heads. That's a binomial distribution.  
  
But if you are part way through your coin tossing and have already tossed it 8 times and got 6 heads, we know its impossible to get 5 heads at that point. So we do the analysis as 6 + (chance of getting heads with 2 more tosses).  
  
3\. Orphan blocks don't tell us much about the pool performance as they are a function of the protocol. All pools will loose blocks by orphans and there is nothing the pool operator can do about it. If two pools are assigned blocks on the same slot, the one with the lower vrf will always win the block.  
  
Hope this helps. I'll add some of this text to the site soon for us. Good questions.",NO

As @oleum  mentioned a healthy chunk of the initial engineering design work will be done using cadCad. This is Python package that integrates nicely with Jupyter notebooks to enable the modelling and simulation work to be completed. Notebooks are a form of documentation with executable code. Once the protocols designs have been model enough they can then be implemented in Plutus using the Playground.

12/Oct/20 11:54 AM,322338,1517,michal.petro,"@liqwid.labs  My motivation behind these question is to understand the total cost of the project and how much of it is expected to be funded from the Catalyst fund. I don't see a clear plan on how to achieve the results (roadmap posted in the discussion https://cardano.ideascale.com/userimages/accounts/93/936143/panel_upload_48088/liqwid.roadmap-c6c869.JPG does not match the project plan in XLS that is attached to the proposal https://cardano.ideascale.com/userimages/accounts/93/936143/panel_upload_48088/Liqwid-Protocol-Project-Catalyst-fund2-Gantt.draft-240d9c.xlsx and the project plan seems pretty much incomplete)

  

If you want to get funded from Catalyst in the following round I believe people deserve to know how much funds you will be asking before the project will be delivered. As a software development professional, I am sceptic about your project plan which you are proposing (3 months of analysis and design work in a 6 months project - my previous experience is that the development, QA and deployment usually takes 2-3 times more time and resources than the planning and design part of the project).

12/Oct/20 10:50 AM,322338,1517,Rodrigo Pacini,"@liqwid.labs  Hi DC, I'm sorry if I seemed too harsh in criticizing your project, but within the projects presented yours is what interests me the most and I criticized points where I didn't see enough clarification.

I understand your point, you want to offer a uncolateralized loan option and I see it useful. However, I also see the danger that this type of service will bring, as regulators will come with force to bring this market to the ground and Liqwid will have to be decentralized enough to avoid something similar to what the CFTC did with BITMEX, where the CEO was sentenced to prison:

https://news.bitcoin.com/bitmex-criminal-charges-prison/#:~:text=Cryptocurrency%20derivatives%20trading%20platform%20Bitmex,founders%20has%20already%20been%20arrested.

You are wrong to say that credit score systems do not exist at Ethereum. This is already being developed.

https://cointelegraph.com/news/teller-raises-1m-in-seed-funding-to-bring-credit-scores-to-defi

Aave recently implemented credit delegation to allow decolateralized loans and already had its first uncolateralized loan approved in July of that year.

https://defirate.com/aave-credit-delegation/

In their system there is a legal agreement and OpenLaw is the company responsible for making this possible.

https://www.p2pfinancenews.co.uk/2020/07/08/aave-launches-undercollateralized-lending-service/

Credit scoring systems are a way to enable uncolateralized loans, but this is not a secret and many people are keeping an eye on this market. I follow DeFi closely and this market moves fast, credit scoring and efficiency systems will not be enough to guarantee success.

I believe that Cardano's blockchain has the ability to offer a more secure and efficient environment for creating DeFi protocols, but what will guarantee the success of this project is the quality of the people involved and the ability to innovate / offer quality and safe services.

I got confused with the term airdrop because you put an image of the roadmap where it says airdrop, maybe that needs to be clearer. I look forward to more information about the distribution of tokens to liquidity providers. I believe that your project tends to cause a great engagement of the Cardano community.

Are you interested in allocating part of the tokens to VCs?  

I didn't find anything in the whitepaper about using oracles other than the oracle pool model, but it's good to know that you are open to options.

The fact is that the model of oracle pools depends on projects and people to provide the data to feed the pools and as far as I know this is not yet established. In addition, the model depends on governance to establish many things in the protocol. This model is not yet functional. For the model to be reliable it needs more decentralization and more people involved in the process.

I put an idea about a month ago here at IdeaScale to finance more research and assistance for the development of the oracle pool model, as I already knew that this is a primitive component needed to develop other pieces in DeFi.

Regarding costs, I am not putting my opinion in a subjective way. You cited the costs for financing the project for 6 weeks at $ 36,500, but you also cited the monthly costs between $ 25,000 and $ 26,000 per month. It was not clear whether the project would need more funding (fund3).

Nodes are also built in haskell and the integration uses Java.

There is just no viable scenario where you could skip part of the development tasks laid out in the proposal where you can end up with a working deliverable.

Also there is no guarantee that further funding will be approved or that the purpose of fund 3,4 or 5 are going to be dev oriented.  

On top of that the proposal and voting process is very time consuming. I spent a month not doing much else other than working on the proposal. Not keen in spending that time again on new proposals for the same thing.  

Lastly, consider I did some work already, without being paid for it or asking to be paid. Lots of code I could reuse from past projects which saved around 6 months of development work. It's pretty much free labor which I fortunately could do. If left for later, there is no guarantee I'll be available to work on this in the future as I need some sort of income and will be forced to pick up unrelated paid projects or even a full time job.  

I don't want to risk starting something I may not be able to finish. I really want to execute and deliver this project, but I need to be sure the funds will be available.

Well there are several, and the entire point of building our protocol on top of Cardano and using Atala Prism to serve as the base of identity is to mitigate those flaws in the current lending protocol designs.

Liqwid is introducing primitives like onchain identity via Prism, credit scores and vouching and an entire user owned platform structure that does not exist on Compound or Aave (or any other lending protocol on Ethereum today).

Liqwid is a global solution. Our co-founder lives in Port Harcourt, Nigeria and our team has a strong working knowledge of the current mobile money system including the financial services built on top. Our team plans to build on top of this structure to enable users outside of crypto to initiate loans or earn interest on their digital money. We are not limiting anything we have spoken with development firms and VC's from India to Eastern Europe, Africa is a focus for many early Cardano solutions linked to identity and as I mentioned our co-founder hails from Nigeria.

An entire blog series will be written on the governance token, tokenomics and distribution when the Multi-asset ledger DSL details are released. The distribution of tokens is also tied to the users of the protocol so to directly answer your question the liquidity providers of Liqwid will be airdropped the governance token in there Daedalus/Yoroi wallet (or any other Cardano wallet that supports multi-assets).

You are mistaking the general crypto term Airdrop with the users of the protocol receiving tokens. The only users that will receive the governance token airdrop are liquidity providers (users) of Liqwid protocol. Hope that clarifies.

Oracle Pools are already live on ergo: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/oracle-pools-list

They are being implemented on Cardano now. Also our team has already explored alternative Oracle options, there are several and the research on them is well covered. You are focused on the Oracle Pools but you don't realize that price feeds are the most basic oracle type and there are \*several\* implementations of price feed oracles on Ethereum not-named Oracle Pools we can easily implement as an alternative. This is an implementation detail and very subject to change.

The cost to finance a protocol that securely brings DeFi to Cardano and provides use and utility is too high in your subjective opinion.

A DAO relies on processes that function through smart contracts, so while I think it would be great to implement some DAO capabilities for Cardano, what I am proposing is something for managing processes only humans can perform (at least for now :wink:).

That said, the Distributed part of DAO is something we can implement, by allowing all decisions to be made by ADA holders in the same way that they will vote for other things through Voltaire's capabilities (such as Catalyst).

The main idea behind the CCC is to replace the intended purpose of the CF, by empowering the community to drive the initiatives we believe are important (something the CF **should** be doing), while democratically electing council and subcommittee members to act on the decisions made by the voting community.

I have read the information and this type of lottery leans towards being a bank, right? Meaning people has to deposit ADA, not delegate them. The interest is distributed as a prize. Although I fancy the idea, it's a little bit far from what I am proposing.

Your first remark is about the negative stigma of gambling. I agree with that. However, there are a lot of countries (yes countries) where lottery is legalized as a fundraising tool for charity. That is why I want to have full transparency about the winnings and the distribution of the wager fees through the Cardano platform.

You mentioned problems with high rates in the loan market in Africa. Why are protocols like Compound and Aave not used more often? since they have much lower rates... Is it just a problem of high gas fees at Ethereum or is it also a matter of population habits?

DeFi on Ethereum is now available to users in Africa, Why Liqwid will bring more users?  

Why did you decide to promote Liqwid as a solution to the loan market in Africa? I see no reason to geographically limit projects on DeFi, because if the project is decentralized it can be used by users all over the world. So I see the idea of ​​using Africa more as a marketing appeal than something practical.

From what I read in the whitepaper you are thinking of handing over governance to the community, so you need to provide more details about the token distribution process. How will the token distribution process be? How long will it take for the token to be distributed?

I saw on the roadmap that you are thinking of doing an aidrop, but there is no mention of that in the whitepaper. How will the process be?

Oracles are a crucial factor in a project like Liqwid. I read in the whitepaper that Liquid will use Cardano's oracle pool model, but this model is still being developed.

I see this with some concern, because you are putting the Liqwid security model in a project that is still under development and that still needs to be tested.

This reliance on oracles can cause setbacks in the Liqwid project.

I really like the idea of ​​this project, but I see some problems that need to be observed by the community:

\- The feasibility of executing what was established in the roadmap in the established time, because as I mentioned, there are dependencies in the oracle pool model.

\- The costs to finance such a project are high. Is there an urgency to approve this idea in fund2?",NO

Our founding team and core devs are taking precisely 0 from the requested development budget. The entire budget is (as we highlighted in the section above) specifically for funding the development partners Appinventiv and Tweag.

Our team will use future dc fund rounds to develop Liqwid MVP until deployed on Plutus. Our roadmap has been prepared by our core development team and validated by both development partners who felt it was reasonable given their previous experience implementing similar dApps. The expected cost to develop the protocol is reflected in our requested budget (1 of the ~6 months funding) so I am not sure what exactly you are asking here could you expand?

We are talking about software development so timelines are certainly dynamic and never set in stone. The estimates from the experts in the space who deliver dApp solutions to clients everyday are the best method we currently have to determine the realistic length of time to MVP deployment. Both of our partners have reviewed our complete set of documentation, activities/tasks and deliverables for the length of solution development and calculated 6 months to be an appropriate amount of time.",NO

1\. Yes, I hope that in a way we are building Cardano community in Ukraine, and it's part of global Cardano community. But even in Kyiv crypto community is very diverse: some are focused on their own projects, some are making good money in DeFi now, some are hanging on Hive and popularise this blog system, while others just work in crypto industry, and some prefer to stay anonymous. In addition there is a big number of people who don't know much about crypto, but are very sympatethical towards this idea in general - this is also the audience I would like to target.

2\. Great suggestion. Apart from ADA giveaway rewards (I'll need to think if to do it, as such things attracts trolls and scammers/spammers), it would be good to reward with merch, books. And of course, I will invite most active listeners to participate.

For example, I had a few times meetup/podcast ""Cryptobreakfast/diner"" (there are some videos on my channel) where I invited everyone interested to sit at the main table and take part in discussion, ask questions.

Also, in terms of signing MOUs with governments, that is a medium to long term plan and will likely not happen within the first 3 months.

Yes, I think physical presence meetups are very important. They were important in the early crypto days and they will remain important when the coronavirus times are over. All the major cryptocurrency projects are doing them. They are done in different ways, sometimes organized by foundations, sometimes by enthusiasts. I haven't seen survey data for meetups and their influence. But will give you a short example. When Blockchain Hub existed in Kyiv, there were lots of meetups (more in 2018 of course than in 2019), sometimes 3 or more times are week, the team from that Hub was even invited to Davos economic forum.

++**Key Questions**++

Before we begin, a key question to ask is –

What are the key objectives for Cardano's decentralised fund?

In our view, it is to create value for ADA holders.

The decentralised fund will either be ADA holders' greatest friend or its greatest enemy. Funding low quality proposals will make the value of ADA go down and funding high value quality proposals will make the value of ADA go up.

Another question to ask is –

Given that Cardano's current success is based on scientific methods and a research first driven approach, does it not make sense to research other decentralised funding systems which have been successful?

We will let you think about this one.

  

Page - 4

++**Introduction**++

We started off the crypto journey back in 2017 and was floored by the idea that anyone, anywhere could invest in the best deals possible without any restrictions. This single idea is what made us interested in digging deeper and it brought us to where we are today.

The people who get access to the best investments with the most upside are the Venture Capitalists. They have the incredible upside because they can invest at the earliest stage possible. The public are left with the IPO round which has the least possible upside. Crypto has given smaller investors access to make some remarkable returns if investments are made wisely.

We helped a project during 2018/2019 which involved decentralised investment decision making which worked very well. That involved around 50 participants who were all incentivised to find/research projects so the fund (around 7 figures USD) could buy a stake in the project (e.g. the token or coin). People who had a good reputation (from doing good work) received most of the rewards if the projects selected appreciated in price.

The top rated project was Cardano and the second best rated project was Celsius Network (which is up x10 since the investment) with Bitcoin taking the third spot.

  

Page - 5

**++The Proposal++**

What we will do is translate all the key findings from our involvement in the previous decentralised funding project in a way that can help improve the outcome of Cardano's decentralised fund.

We can take all the positive points from that project and if useful incorporate it in to Cardano's decentralised funding system. Also, we can take all the things that did not work so well and avoid repeating the same mistakes. We will have a case study to learn from which is incredibly relevant to what we are building out today with Cardano's decentralised fund.

Completing this proposal would take between 1 to 2 months which includes –

1\. Detailed information on the previous decentralised funding project (e.g. how the system worked)

2\. Translating findings to help streamline Cardano's decentralised funding system in a way that drives value for ADA holders while removing a lot of the complexities

\+ On-going feedback to IOHK and community members to help make Cardano the best it can be.

++**Compensation**++

***Slide updated on 21st October 2020 to reflect the new ADA/USD exchange rate.***

The fee for this proposal will be $29k (276,644 ADA).

(This is a standard fee you would expect from firms like EY & PWC whom I have worked with before in previous companies)

73,380 will be delegated to our Stakepool (ICORG) and will not be liquidated until ADA reaches $1 in value (this incentivises performance of driving value for ADA holders).

203,264 ADA will be used for taxes and expenses.

++**Results**++

You have a low cost proposal that delivers results, and if we get this system right, it would be stronger than even the best venture capitalist teams. This will make ADA one of the most valuable eco-systems on the planet.

A well-built system will encourage participants to become more educated and savvy investors that can build wealth, help ADA appreciate in value and drive economic growth which is dearly needed in today's stagnating economies.

10/Oct/20 7:43 PM,322286,1499,Phil Lewis,"Hi Stephen

Interesting idea.

This is similar to something I contemplated pre-ITN when playing with the early jormungandr node. I thought it might be possible to provide Stake Pool as a Service for those not technically capable of doing so. There are opportunities to automate the provisioning and running of stake pools using container technology such as Kubernetes.

There was talk pre-Shelley about how people delegating to stake pools may do so based not purely on the returns (although this is obviously the primary motivation for most), but also to support what the stake pool wants to achieve, so supporting a start-up may be one of those.

I have an idea of my own that I am waiting until Plutus and Prism to be able to properly work on, but had thought when considering how to fund it that I would consider using a stake pool (so basically what you are suggesting). At the time I was considering a token for the dApp and to incentivise ADA holders to stake with my pool I was planning to offer the token to them as a reward on top of the staking rewards they would get from the pool. This is something that start-ups could also do as part of your idea.

Users of my dApp would pay for it either in ADA or the dApp token (i.e. it would be a utility token) and I planned to peg the token to a fixed ratio with ADA, so the cost of using the dApp service would be based on a known exchange rate. The use of the dApp token could be incentivised by offering discounts if using it over ADA. Those that supported the stake pool who received the dApp token as a reward would be getting them at a rate based on how long they had stayed with the pool and obviously how much they had staked. The amount would eventually be exchangeable for ADA at the fixed ratio (once the service was ready and others wanted to buy the token) meaning long term they would be getting more ADA (hopefully) than if they had gone with another stake pool (i.e. it is a longer term investment than jumping around stake pools). They could of course keep the dApp token to use the service at a discounted rate if they wanted.

This could also work for other start-ups, whether they are launching a dApp or not. Even non-tech start-ups could take advantage of this, they would just need to make a commitment to allow customers of their business to to pay for their goods or service in ADA and/or a custom token. If their business succeeds then the token they had rewarded delegators with will have value and the delegators can sell them for a greater gain.

If you would be interested in collaborating then let me know as I think we could refine your idea down to something that could take off, even for start-ups not related to Cardano.

10/Oct/20 6:59 PM,324335,1870,rphair,"@yutazzz  If you want to see the key measures of success, within the time frame of this project bid and also long after the proposal period, you'll be able to find them here in the evolving Cardano Improvement Proposal draft here (also linked above) under ""Development Plan"": https://github.com/rphair/CIPs/blob/uri-delegation-portfolio/CIP-COSD-MultiPoolStakeURIscheme/CIP-COSD-MultiPoolStakeURIscheme.md

Since the parameters for success all depend upon what IOHK and Emurgo developers are willing and able to do, what is achievable during a typical 6-month time frame will depend upon how they initially engage. So far they've done nothing but push back about the CIP and have had a pretty cold response to this Catalyst proposal as well. The stake pool owners, who will benefit the most from the scheme, will have to drive it forward.  

That's why this proposal is here: to present IOHK & Emurgo with a mandate for the development of the URI scheme and provision whatever dedicated project management may be necessary. If you vote this proposal in, *they'll have to* do something about it, and we'll have application support for stake pool URIs within 6 months in the best manner we can possibility implement. If they're *not* presented with that mandate, the concept of Stake Pool URIs and its related proposals are likely to remain unapproved or unimplemented indefinitely.",NO

Hi and thank you for your comment.

You are correct that the Guild Operators repository is a collaborative effort. It consists of contributions for more than just CNTools, like Markus topology updater service, documentation, and help guides. The initial idea was to seek funds for the entire Guild effort but it quickly became evident that seeking funds for a collaboration like this would be a pain to manage, how do you measure each contribution and the value they bring in a fair way.

This is why I decided to focus the proposal on CNTools and gLiveView specifically and seek the funds as an individual, as these are the two contributions to the guild repository I'm the main contributor to. So the funds would go to my continued work on these tools. But I also recognize the work put in by a few other members. So if my fund request is approved and they decide not to seek funding on their own, I will sponsor their continued work at my discretion. Their time is NOT included in the calculation in the proposal.

\*\*Update\*\*  
Based on Yuta's question and to make it more clear that I seek funding as an individual to continue to the work on these specific tools in the guild repository I rephrased some of the sentences in the proposal.",NO

At first I was scepticus of this proposal, but then it got me thinking. Nothing travels as fast and long as a good melody or song. We still talk about the Beatles today! Many people can humm the Twist.

To improve this idea and fit in the 6 month challenge, I would consider specifics on how many intermediate samples you intend to release for review with the community if any, which will allow you to specify a concrete timeline.

I'm not entirely clear on whether you aim to publish a song with vocal lyrics (an actual message) or if this is just going to be instrumental?

Furthermore, it might be valuable to list how you wish to distribute and publish the final song? Community distribution is great, but might there be options of listing it on open platforms as well? Or services like SoundCloud?

Next, would it be possible to add a lyrics video to the song for publication on YouTube? (Adds costs of course)

And going from there, what about having the song (or just the lyrics) translated into Hindi and Spanish? Check your timeline in the process.

I know personally from my experience, I enjoyed talking with other people in person and learning from them when I first got into crypto.

It seems at the hi-level you are building a marketing dApp that helps businesses complete more ""social good"" digital ads campaign with advertising budget dollars. Still not even sure why a business would be compelled to do this when as you mention they have entire teams already dedicated to this (even if not within their advertising/marketing budget).

You mention beta testing, have any of the organizations who beta tested WTIM completed a survey/process feedback and what the steps were like from start to finish from their perspective? Usually early beta/alpha testing like this help you gather large customer feedback data which can serve as your early product validation/case study examples from which you can innovate the product. Do you have any insights on what this feedback/perspective has been for WTIM alpha/beta organizations?

The reason I am asking this is because without this information how can you confidently make claims like ""***WTIM will proably create billions of transactions on Cardano***.""

I am not sure if I am still missing some key info here and I apologize if I am, just trying to gain some clarity on what it is you are proposing to build and if there is actually any demand for this type of Marketing dApp for digital ads versus the solutions most organizations are using today.

Thanks for your comment and for taking an interest.

Regarding ""how this proposal answers the current challenge to attract developers and businesses to build on Cardano"", this is an interesting question and one I have pondered for most proposals that have been submitted in Fund 2. I think most are focused on being the the developer or the business and not in attracting them. That said, I (and presumably others do too) think it is OK to maybe seek funding for ideas outside of the current challenge scope, as it is in reality quite limiting and given the community's excitement about engaging in the start of Voltaire, I suspect most are quite open to throwing out what was essentially a centrally decided scope in favour of a community decided one.

The idea behind my proposal is to assemble groups of people who can work directly on what the community consider important. This could potentially include activities that ""attract developers and businesses"".

Regarding community response, there hasn't been much engagement, which suggests it isn't an idea others are interested in. I thought there would be more as there was a reasonable response to having a community driven roadmap due to the lack of progress by the CF, but that interest doesn't appear to have transferred into this initiative.",NO

I understand that the budget is not very high; it would be great if Charles can help us by doubling our funding in order to be able to market more vigorously and therefore reach more people in that lapse of time.

acquisition of app users is as always rather difficult, however I thought about this model: Once a user creates an account (we dont know if he is writer / reader), he gets e.g. 100 reading tokens. If he reads some article, he can use 1 to 5 tokens as a fee for the writer. E.g. article was nice, i give 5 tokens. The writer gets 5 tokens (from another user), that he can cash out. If the writers withdraws tokens for some article, all his readers get one third of what they ""paid"" as a fee, this amount could also be cashed out (by readers but not before a writer). There should be some mechanism of getting new reading tokens, perhaps every time user finishes reading 20 articles.

If there is a case of a fake article, user who spots it, may report it; another user (perhaps with higher role, e.g. editor validates it). Both users (reporter + validator) get some fee, but they can withdraw it only after some time.

There is going to be more complexity about roles management (e.g. how users becomes an editor …). The app itself can make money of advertisements, though its main focus is to provide good content.

  

I dont have any team behind. I only know that I can code such app myself. Brave is about ads spotting, this app would encourage users to participate (read, write, edit..);

Of all the ""podcast"" proposals, yours is one of the few that has actually demonstrated the ability to deliver. If I can suggest one thing to set you apart: far be it from me to tell anyone how to operate their channels, but I think it would be awesome if you could style a regular weekly show similar to how Hashoshi sets up his shows. I'm sure you know his channel, if not you can look it up. I know you're not a developer, so it is a little different. But it would be awesome if you could field a set of good questions (sent to you beforehand by the community). You could research and find the answers and deliver it to the community in an understandable way. The way you talk and converse is very understandable and down to earth, but I personally would enjoy a segment where you field the tougher technical questions and deliver an ""edited"" and susinct response.

09/Oct/20 1:01 AM,324023,1827,Beaver (BEAVR),"Hi Greg,

After thinking about it for a bit, I feel like it would be rather difficult to provide a framework to say, help developers in generating smart contracts that would help define core game mechanics and rules, plus a contract that would help shape a user's game state. I feel like creating a framework or library around this would be far too specific and limiting, as developers could wish to change some of the smart contract design to their own personal liking. In the end, developers will need to develop these smart contracts on their own, using Plutus, to shape the core of their game. I feel like creating a library that would help generate these smart contracts for the game would be a difficult problem as I don't want to limit any developer's design for a game.

So I'm essentially going to double-down on my current proposal, but I think it would bring developers into the space because the proof-of-concept smart contracts developed by this proposal (since they'd be available to the public) can serve as a framework to help developers create games using this structure in the future.",NO

I am sorry, but i disagree. I feel a lot of original post respected CE, but requested an additional breakdown of the cost. At least 15 questions for more information. And they simply did not want to provide. To me, this left a very negative sentiment. If anything, in a refine situation, you listen to feedback and integrate and update your proposal. They simply preferred to cancel proposal, which is their good right.

I personally feel no project should receive funds that does not want to provide a cost breakdown. Regardless CE or IOG. I have less problems with the amount, as I need a cost breakdown to assess where that does, and clear deliverables, what that delivers, specifically to the funding question.

This could trigger a real application ecosystem, all dedicated to solve the problem of distributing a wallet's ADA after the chosen 'Proof of Life' is not fulfilled. Considering such a potential application ecosystem, quite some developers could be motivated to join with related applications.

2) I suggest to outline a complete and plausible vision and a concept for a related application ecosystem (which will be needed due to the complexity of the underlying topic of what to do if ADA holders die or are no longer able to enter their wallet), but then focus on the first application in Fund 2. This should be the 'triggering application', which fulfills the very basic needs and triggers the ideation of other complementary apps.

Thanks for your feedback :+1:

The automatic donation mechanism is a payment system where we request our customers set up a small, automatic, recurring donation to Torus that comes out of their compensation wallet at the same time they pay their contributors. This will make it easy and painless to give back to Torus. The UI will set the donation level to a small, non-zero amount by default, and it will explain that the donation will go towards operational costs and ongoing improvements. This is effectively the pay-what-you-want funding model, which we have found in our research to be the most agreeable model with customers for funding open source software projects.

Torus must be an open source project in order follow the ethos of the target customers, who are themselves open source software project owners, maintainers, and contributors. In addition, keeping Torus open source will also allow everyone in the Cardano community to benefit from the contributions made in Project Catalyst directly by using Torus to manage their open source projects for free. Indirectly, the Cardano community will benefit as more and more OS contributors are paid in ADA for their time. This will bring more developers into the Cardano community.

We realize that the pay-what-you-want model represents a risk in terms of ongoing funding, but we have done research into the funding models available for open source projects, and there are a variety of existing models that we can look at as alternatives before launch. We will work with partner customers to field test the viability of our automatic donation mechanism as well as the alternatives we have compiled on our GitHub wiki: https://github.com/torus-online/torus/wiki/Funding-Models

In addition, there have been a number of interesting proposals in Fund2 that we can also test, such as @pascal  's idea to operate a stake pool and receive the staking rewards as a donation: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Staking-for-Open-Source-Software/324475-48088

I am confident that we will be able to secure a stable source of funding. However, even if we fail to secure a stable source of funding, all of our work is open source and hosted on GitHub, which will allow anyone in the open-source and Cardano communities to make use of our work. It can be self-hosted or it can be extended and improved.",NO

We are an ATM operator in Ireland. We use General Bytes Manufactured machines. We have not integrated coins before ( The manufacture integrates coins, but Ada is not on their priority roadmap). They indicated we can do the development ourselves as an extension to their software ( it has been done for other coins and wallets)

We are working with vacuumlab ( The team that created Adalite wallet) to do the integration of Ada into the General Bytes machines and this is the quote for development.

It's true $5000 investment is not that big and will bring a huge benefit to the Cardano ecosystem.

From an ATM operator perspective, we are passionate about adding Ada so ++all operators++ can benefit. There's no strategic advantage gained by us by paying for this directly. We are of course not putting any cost to our own time to develop this proposal and manage the project.

Some background is here: https://github.com/GENERALBYTESCOM/batm_public/issues/241

That said, there is precious little information about your skills in Functional Programming, Plutus, and the languages that will be part of the curriculum.

In the responses to Daniel's comments you suggest that this will take on an experimental aspect with respect to the planning of direction.  
It is really hard to get funds for a project that is an experiment, and openly says that it will ""feel it's way"" toward a plan. What can help that along is knowing that the proposer has successfully moved the needle in previous experiments.

08/Oct/20 1:59 PM,323980,1818,Steven Aldrich,"@erik  Thanks for the graphic. It helps understand the flow and payouts within the lottery.

In my first comment I asked about how the funds will be split out across the planks of your proposal. I am asking for some idea of what amount of the funds will be utilized.  
For instance, how much is slated for the Wallet Development that seems to be needed.  
How much for marketing of the Lottery once the wallet is done.  
I am attempting to tease out details that seem relevant and needed if the proposal is to succeed.

I do have another point to raise that might help.  
The Name of the proposal introduces the concept that it will ""Increase Financial ID"". and this is never really addressed in the proposal body. It feels a bit like click-bait, if it is not actually a Plank of the Proposal.  
It is hard to decide if the proposal is a **Lottery, a Charity, A facility of Financial ID inclusion, or a Wallet**. These are what I am calling the ""planks"" of the Proposal. The challenge here is to thread together a theme of what funding will be spent on amongst these Planks, and how it will be distributed across them.",NO

I think it's a good idea but I question why you need funding. There must be revenue from these ATMs so adding ADA is only in your best interest and a $5000 investment is not that big. Did you also get funding to integrate these other coins?  

To me this is similar to an exchange asking for funding to list ADA and I don't see why I would support that because it's only in their best interest to list ADA, if they don't they just miss out on a lot of revenue. So I would like to see better reasoning as to why you need funding, more insight into how your business works.",NO

It is really important that the proposal body include the results of the comments, and other learnings.

We are here to give back to the Cardano Community and follow the \`Charles Hoskinson lead\` of offering to doing things at COST to bring about change. We will adjust the budget to 100k for fund 2 and if we are successful we can apply for a second 100k in fund 3 as you suggest as we should be able to give metrics and more information between Fund2 and 3 to prove the sincerity of our proposal and earn greater support from the community, we value your continued support especially ; )

3)Build on the solid foundations

4)No business change

5)Cheap and easy to maintain

6)Secure""

And you are correct there is a longer term vision here and if we find support it will grow like a large tree from a very small seed-

""we have been thinking a lot for a long time about the term ""decentralize everything"" so when we apply this to networking architecture principles, the logical thing is to create a DAO that is a native asset On Cardano to create demand for ADA and to bring a large Global DAO project to Cardano to showcase that infrastructure and to grow with it in the future. This utility DAO vision starts with the CCMs as they would contribute to building it with the amazing tools at their disposal and thus it would be the worlds first Decentralized Utility governed by a DAO built for the blockchain. At the core is the notion of having an interoperable global internetwork for Blockchains so that the network is optimized for blockchains decentralized architecture, this need is becoming more and more apparent everyday as this is in essence a mission critical component of decentralization. Thus, the DAOs founding and primary mission would be to transparently show ownership and contracts making up this decentralized network in real time, so the DAO can endeavor to ensure the network architecture is dedicated and in turn incentivized to always growing to be more decentralized LoL This idea is a result of the Project Catalyst process and we feel grateful for the opportunity to be apart of This awesome community, so it is as much the CCMs idea as anybody's and In turn we are the conduit to sharing that output =vision, we are here to give back and not to waste recourses.

With Regards to our Fund2 proposal its focus is to deploy OuroborusOverRina (OoverR) in Japan initially and to share metrics with the CCMs openly and transparently but we are very confident you will be pleasantly surprised with the KPIs and to do this at COST as the first step towards the DAO - (any clientoverRINA can Eventually be tested)""",NO

I support this proposal, but I want to leave an alert for everyone who is reading:

There are many podcast proposals to be financed by fund2 and we need to be careful and not spend all funds on podcasts. We need to set priorities. As much as I like several Cardano content creators, there is no point in financing who will produce generic content or the content is not specific enough/in line with the proposal of fund2.

Pay attention to the fact that all channels that talk about Cardano on Youtube have few views and reflect. Is it worth using fund2 to fund podcasts that are an echo chamber of our community?

That is why in fund2 I prefer to vote for proposals like this, from Lovelace Academy. Although the material doesn't have great potential to reach many people, the fact that it is a more educational material increases the efficiency in what it proposes to do for the fund2 proposal.",https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/idea/325871/32886/download

There are more than ten proposals for podcasts and similar projects. If we are going to finance all these projects we will have to use all the funds in podcasts.

I don't think it's wise to spend the entire fund2 on podcasts, so there is a need to filter podcast proposals. That said, I think it is more important to allocate a part of fund2 to podcasts that are educational and provide essential material for developers who need to develop projects at Cardano.

This week has been full or prior commitments so it has been difficult to put in the work. We are wanting the remaining pieces to be locked in ASAP to give time window for community discussion and finalise the proposal.  
  
The distributed team has been working on refining the deliverables. Proposal explainer video being worked on and filmed as a demonstrator for expected output.  
  
I've been giving thought to ""Return in Intention"" and how we can manifest that into very rudimentary an impact measure. Not wanting to collect lots of metrics but still give some guide on value measurement. We'll be using the available intrinsic activity metrics and community metrics to do this. I need to surface that as actionable OKRs.  
  
A simple component-based roadmap outlined into a four-week cadence. Still need to detail out a little more around the protocol engineering work but I'm holding off on that work until next week.  
  
Risks documented but still need to run past the rest of the team. Costs and time commitments are getting discussed tonight/tomorrow before locking in the budget.  
  
No changes to the above proposal, just refinements of the missing pieces.  
  
Just a note for others reading this comment: This proposal was conceived toward the end-of-week one by a small distributed team of Cardano Community members that met virtually. The group formed as a result of discussing project Catalyst proposals and ideas that interested us in the creative arts sector. The team has grown since. We are distributed across the globe from NZ-North America-UK. Hence we are using an internal collaborative logic to discuss and develop this proposal which is not visible through Ideascale.",NO

Are saying you think this ERP tool should be used to create/test formal methods?

In that case, that is beyond my scope and capability.

This is a ""my"" vague idea.

Formal methods are required for Cardano development.

Therefore, companies other than IOG should use formal methods when developing Cardano.

However, formal methods had a trade-off with the need for large resources.

However, this paper clarified how to use formal methods without much resource deprivation.

Therefore, it would have been ideal if there was a resource management tool that would allow companies other than IOG to successfully use the flexible formal methods developed by IOG.",NO

Hi Yuta-san,

Thank you for your suggestions. I will try and breakdown the budget as much as I can to include unit price and time. Please keep in mind that software development time is coming at a large discount, since hiring a software developer is very expensive. I would be developing this myself with a friend or friends so it would mostly be charity. Additionally, it is difficult to say how long different parts may take for now, which is why we are using broad descriptions. I hope to refine this more as soon as I have researched a bit more.

For Fund2, if we were to receive funding and if the people want to have an open source framework to develop turn-based games, then we would release the framework as open source. Otherwise, the game would be proprietary. Keep in mind, though, that the smart contracts used to implement this game, will be visible to the public, even if an official open source framework is not released.",NO

After rereading my solution description I fully understand your question. And I should definitely revise it (just got no idea yet how to keep it in 140chars)

To address your question:

\- First, I think of the Payment Facilitator as a third party service, a neutral running instance, which is being operated but not governed, comparable to a staking pool. It enacts as intermediary that has to be trusted - but appears more trustable to users than yet unknown services/business partners.

\- For smart contracts goguen has to be there. A basic facilitator could be implemented just with Shelley and annotated metadata within transactions. Admittedly, the solution would not be as ""beautiful"" as with smart contracts and require several transactions between all parties, and most importantly, it would require as much trust as a current crypto exchange. So it is probably reasonable to base it on smart contracts in the first place.

\- This facilitator can allow to offer way more flexibility (just my guess since I can't fully grasp the possibilities of smart contracts so far) as to how resolve conflicts between customers and services: If needed you could entrust a third party with the refunding process / use Voltaire voting / adhere to a specific refund policy prior to usage / …

\- The facilitator can gather statistics and reveal payment/service history to its users.

\- The facilitator can temporarily stake the collected ADA and gather funds which could then be used for:

\- compensating transaction fees

\- covering running costs

\- subsidizing settlement in case of refunds

\- …

  

Admittedly, I am yet in progress of understanding smart contracts - their purpose and their possibilities - and want to give this more time before proceeding on this proposal. My impression, however, is that this more than what smart contracts could do on their own.",NO

07/Oct/20 3:33 PM,323938,1803,Stefan Kombrink,"@daniel.ribar  Thank you very much for taking the time to check out my proposal, and excuse me for a late reply.

I agree with your observation that specifics regarding time frame, funding and scope are yet missing. I've submitted this on rather short notice with the intent to get at least something written down instead of waiting for something more specific will emerge to me outta nowhere. So far so good.

I believe this proposal addresses the current focus as it lowers the reservation of consumers to send payments to potentially untrusted parties which otherwise would be irrevocable. On the other hand this increased acceptance will encourage businesses to offer payments of their services or goods while adhering to certain refunding policies.

While the payment facilitator is required as an instance to enact as intermediate it would be also necessary to develop an easy-to-use solution to send Ada from a private wallet with some specific metadata. Similar things can be done with bitcoin core but this is not yet possible in Daedalus yet it seems.

I'd like to develop the idea further but I feel I'd need to learn about smart contracts / goguen first. I am still investigating and gathering knowledge on all related subjects and I can't foresee how much time it will take me to get the details sorted out.

Hence I consider withdrawing my proposal for the time being, or - I don't know if that's possible - get it postponed to an upcoming funding round.

The Powerpack and Megapack units purpose is to store energy, but I feel these storage units are a necessary component to the plan, seeing as we want to develop in regions that aren't always sunny. I also share the vision of other utility scale solar energy systems that can meet electricity demand even at night. On a side note, I personally like Tesla's Powerpack/Megapack-- for their ""plug and play setup."" If you're aware: their powerpacks and megapacks come fully assembled with up to 3 megawatt hours of storage and 1.5 megawatts of inverter capacity. It may be a bit lazy but I like the idea of setting up infrastructure in 3 months as Tesla is capable of doing. Tesla appears to be the best and has proven themselves with their work in Kauai Hawaii and even Australia. But you're right it would increase cost and I'm open to suggestions but considering the project without batteries seems like a fail in the long run. I want the best and with ada being a potential growing sponsor I even feel a relationship could be developed with the guy who named his kid X Æ A-Xii.

  

You're right again in about the Belize and Guatemala EIS. I'm still continuing to reach out to various organizations and waiting on replies too. But Belize is my first milestone. my travels and research confirm leased lands that are forested must be ""developed"" by the owners or their leases can be revoked. Meaning, there is an enormous incentive for landowners to clear the land in an effort to meet the requirements of ""development."" Inevitably, forested lands are converted to alternative land uses; however, a significant number of properties just lie idle after they have been cleared because the landowners lack the capital to meaningfully engage in alternative land use. The ada funding is an option to this or if im successful utilize a nonprofit approach to be given land. There's also the potential, to be like China and place panels/units on water, utilizing Belize's Barrier Reef System—but the water levels are rising...Rapid and uncontrollable coastal development for residential and commercial purposes is an escalating threat to Belize's coastal zone. A recent study estimated that 75–80% of all coastal land in Belize has been purchased by foreigners who will develop the land into condos, resorts, or residential properties, usually at the expense of the mangroves and littoral forests. I could use ada funding to be that ""guy."" Belize is connected to a power grid in Mexico and also has a hydroelectric dam covering about 3 square miles (8 square km) built on the Macal River in western Belize. I want to build within these vicinity. These conversations are happening , while still awaiting replies too. I'm also identifying potential collaborators and competitors who have and are doing it as well. Funding would also expedite this process seeing as there are paid services available too.

The organization would use smart contracts to handle everything from transactions between participants, customers, Belizean government and etc. Belize being the starting point is also in need reformation in various areas from education to preservation and more. This gives us the opportunity to introduce development with developers to tackle these obstacles with dapps and build wealth with the coin and create business for cardano making use of its interoperability and staying on the pulse of events to provide and find practical use for it being an integral part of the business. I hope that makes sense.

2: Initially the funds were meant to establish the organization, operations and pay for the batteries and panels. But I appear to have garnered some traction from this idea and know there are better ways as opposed to just buying from Tesla. I appreciate the Kudos and I will definitely rework the budget this week and would love more comments and suggestions. I'm still a fan using Tesla's technology for the power plant and am still waiting back from them. There are no rates released for Powerpacks nor Megapacks, everything is on an inquire basis for utility sized installations(which is what the goal is). This is crucial data for the budget. Some predictions from blogs guesstimate units even being around $750 000 per Megapack unit. Ideally, id prefer to have Tesla as a partner to secure a deal, either get a discounted/rebate rate or free equipment in exchange for them being able to use their Powerhub and Autobidder programs. Funding would then go to establishing the organization, labor, research and more ventures to aide Belize. I'm still awaiting Tesla to reply back to me, but I will put together 2-3 budget scenarios and again I'm open to suggestions and any valuable data. You mentioned to create a first milestone, to me Seeing as Belize is incredibly small this would be our first milestone and I'm still awaiting replies from Belize organizations and schools.

3:Timeline:

Again an ambitious and dreamlike perfect scenario timeline, so forgive me. But I wanted to reply. If I received funding: by the end of 30 days I'd like to have organization established including strong visuals and slogan to show potential corporate partners(Tesla, Belize) since they're taking there time with me as a small fry. By the end of 60 days the venture should be more fine tuned. By the end of 90 days venture should be finalized and proposal ready and making appointments with corporate decision makers to pitch it. Ideally then from there the first venture would be operational. Meaning Tesla could begin installing their plug and play units in a span of 3 months and were planning on Guatemala. That's an ambitious schedule, but I would certainly like to move that fast. I will fine tune this timeline along with my budget. Id love to have the opportunity to focus all my attention on this and pursue it full time if I received funding and traction.",NO

We have a rough timeline but I miss a member target, for example how many guild members you would define as rendering item 1 ""done"". Reading on you might add which developer profile you're looking for (and by who) to pour the standards into code. And so on.

Also, while you have a date mapped to every item in the list, it may help you to think about how much of the ADA budget you wish to invest in every listed item, which will help you reflect on setting time and target boundaries more specifically. Eg. I imagine building the guild is going to cost less money than negotiating standards? (But not for me to decide)

07/Oct/20 3:44 AM,322338,1517,Will,"Hi Dewayne ...thanks for getting back to me and point me in the direction of your proposal. This should be a no-brainer for community funding. Some initial thoughts - I have a few suggestions in terms of your proposal from the non-technical readers point of view (e.g. as much as possible try to avoid technical terms to make the proposal more accessible to the non-technical but intelligent reader) - readers that may want to read through the hundreds of proposal that are in the race. We should know what you are asking for in the first 2 paras -and if we think its got legs then read on. I would suggest that you begin with the 'Purpose of the Project Proposal'. At the most this should be 2 paras that state clearly the strategic driver of the project (e.g. In response to the current high fees in the instant loan solutions in both traditional finance and the DeFi space, the proposers of this Project (Project name) seek USD 36,500 = 365,000 ADA (ADA ~ USD 0.10) 325600 ADA for an initial 4 month period from X to Y - dates) and what the funds are for (e.g. to deploy a dedicated blockchain team to conduct a range of development activities including the completion of roadmap and project plan, defining overall protocol architecture, project plan and wireframes). I would suggest that if you are saying you are likely to have a minimal viable product (MVP- try to avoid acronyms the first time you use the term in the proposal) in 5 - 6 months - then you can make the list of activities that this funding is going toward a lot stronger given that the funding gets the project to within 1-2 months from an MVP. In a way you would be better off going for 6 months funding and saying that you will deliver an MVP at the end of it. That is a very clear milestone that is likely to strongly resonate with the community - funding toward the completion of roadmap and project plans is not always something you want to highlight. I'll have to leave it there for now - but as i said - I think this project meets Dor's description of the low-hanging fruit that the first 6 months Catalyst project mission statement supports. As an aside, you should reference that mission statement in your proposal to reinforce the point that the project is directly in line with the 6 month strategic directions of the catalyst fund and cardano community. Happy to stay engaged if you find the feedback useful.",NO
07/Oct/20 2:27 AM,322194,1444,Will,"@mercya1  I am still getting my head around the Catalyst funding tempo for projects - if you can ask for 1 year of funding then that is much better for you in terms of providing certainty. Some very quick thoughts. The funding argument should be folded into what i would describe as the argument concerning building on-the-ground Cardano capabilities in West Africa (I think you need to go beyond a 'Cardano presence' to 'capacity building'). Your proposal already does this, but I think you can frame your argument concerning long-term certainty for the WADA project team in terms of capability gap that you are highlighting - the gap between the current state of Cardano engagement and capacity building in West Africa, and the future state that the WADA project wants to initiate and facilitate. Your first draft of a roadmap (these need to be iterative and responsive to environmental factors e.g. COVID) should come out of this type of gaps statement (this is where we are - almost no presence, engagement and capacity building, to having long-term presence, engagement and capacity building that necessarily requires guaranteed a yearly certainty of funding for the reasons you set out above. The issue of COVID is easy to address if you can quickly put together a roadmap that sets out the streams of activity linked back to the Pan African Cardano objectives (maybe you can adopt some of the work done on the CF community Roadmap?). Basically what you would be showing more or less as you have already stated is that you don't expect the COVID problem to be solved in WA in the next four months, and therefore the WADA project is proposing to re-prioritise WADA roadmap activities and adopt four monthly funding cycles given the types of funded activities and the level of uncertainty surrounding how the COVID issue is going to play out. All this can framed using the usual 'agile methodology' buzz words.

This proposal has to do a lot of work - in a sense it needs to be setting out its roadmap of activities and approval and funding model, governance structures etc as though everything were normal - and then showing how the Project is pivoting given the abnormal situation. If COVID is an issue - then this should also go up in your Strategic Environment section - as something that is impacting on the what can and cannot be done in terms of Roadmap activities.

06/Oct/20 4:14 AM,322194,1444,Will,"Hi Mercy - more low hanging fruit for your proposal is to add a para that expands on the point that this project will 'help achieve the overall goals of the Cardano Pan African Strategy'. If there is a written strategy then i suggest you get some words from there - but if it is just that Cardano is going to pursue its general objectives in a Pan African context then maybe spell out what those objectives are - as I understand it they include: Digital identity solutions; decentralised finance and access to global markets; and product authentication and traceability solutions….If you want this to go under a heading it can go under 'Strategic Directions' These objectives should help provide a structure to the 4 monthly work packages…For the lead in for this section of the proposal you could use your words - The work packages developed under the WADA Project will be designed to implement the goals of the Cardano Pan African Strategy.

I am not sure how legit it is - but the way i see it is that you will need to state right up in the first two paras that the Project is also seeking community agreement to return on a four monthly basis, and submit the work package for the next four months, and to report back on the outcomes of the funded activities over the previous four months. You can sell this by saying something like - the sheer span of outputs and timelines to be delivered by the Project necessitates a delivery strategy where the scope elements (you will need to do a bit more work on these) can be progressed as managed 4 monthly work packages that will be presented to the Catalyst Fund for approval.

What you will also need to do is bolster your argument of why it is important to have sustained and consistent Cardano presence in the West African region - as opposed to the current form of engagement…this is fundamental to your project proposal …",NO

06/Oct/20 1:36 AM,322194,1444,Mercy,@zero000  This is very helpful Will. I've planned to set aside a large chunk of time this week to re-organize and focus this proposal and very much value this input along with all the others. Thanks a lot for making time to stop by :pray:,NO
06/Oct/20 1:23 AM,322194,1444,Will,"Hi Mercy - I like your proposal a lot. Here are some very quick thoughts. These have to be prefaced by the fact that I am unaware of the criteria that are being used to assess proposals. What I am doing is applying criteria that i am familiar with for assessing applications for funding.

I am not sure whether you are using a Catalyst template for your headings - but if not I would suggest that you begin with the 'Purpose of the Project Proposal'. At the most this should be 2 paras that state clearly what you are seeking (e.g. 325600 ADA @ 10cents/ADA for an initial 4 month period from X to Y) what the funds are for (e.g. to establish a Cardano presence in the West African sub region, comprising of 2 Full Time Employees (FTE - can you give this a little more clarity) a fund Project Lead 1 FTE, Communication/Networking Manager 1FTE, (Local employees with one year contract renewable yearly over 3 years).

This bit of information can be prefaced with the main strategic driver for why you are seeking the funds etc. So it could read something like ' In response to the immense opportunities West Africa presents for Cardano blockchain adoption the proposers of this Project (Project Name) seek 325600 ADA @ 10cents/ADA for an initial 4 month period from X to Y (dates) to establish a Cardano presence in the West African sub region consisting of a small local salaried team on the ground (2 Full Time Employees (FTE), supported by a small international volunteer Cardano community expertise), to carry out day to day activities of public relations, advocacy, marketing, community engagement, education and accelerate the creation of dapps and businesses and attract new entrepreneurs into the Cardano ecosystem attuned to solving local problems. This team will also be a decentralised, cost-effective, innovative contribution to achieving the goals of the Cardano Pan African Strategy.

Once you have got this out of the way - you could then go into a description of the Strategic Landscape - as a heading. The stuff you have in Background is a bit dated - do you have anything more current than 2014? Also suggest that in addition to the high level stuff you also bring in something about the competition with other blockchain providers. I suggest that you elevate some of the stuff you have under the 'Project's Known Issues' into this section. Basically the message that you are wanting to get across is that there is all this opportunity for the Cardano project in West Africa, but there is also a growing presence of competing blockchain enterprises and that Cardano's current strategy for growing opportunities in the region is not sufficient to compete or fully capitalise on the opportunities.

The challenge that you have with raising funds for this project is that the project has a three year timeline, but you are seeking funds for the initial 4 months. This may mean that you have to provide more granularity for Year 1 of the project, breaking it into 3X4 months to give a better picture of where the first 4 months fits in to the first years' overall workload.

Another issue as I see it is linked to the problem that the life of the project is three years - and you have to return every 4 months to seek further funding. I think you need to set out some type of approval and funding model that matches the chunks of activities and provide a governance structure that allows a reporting back on the outcomes each 4 months. As I see it you need a governance structure that provides a high degree of accountability and assurance to the Cardano community that the funds are being expended according to the agreed proposal - otherwise it is unlikely that funding will be repeated.

I'll leave it there - i agree with a lot of what Greg has said above. If you have any questions or would like clarification on some of these points more than happy to be of assistance.",NO

There may be an option to convince them to move their project to Cardano (they have not specified their chosen chain during our call for confidentiality reasons), however in order to partner with them, I have to create a proposal for them, thus I am forced to increase the asked amount from 75000 ADA to 225 000 ADA, the additional deliverable will be a detailed analysis of why build such Decentralized and Distributed Cloud Platform as a Cardano side-chain based on Cardano and Ouroboros Praos with recursive ZK snarks used to roll-up the telemetry chain every 30 days similarly to how CODA based on Ouroboros is trying to achieve.  
  
Monthly invoicing and service constracts including Service Level Agreements would still take place on Cardano mainnet, thus generating significant revenue in terms of fees for stakeholders; in addition, ADA would still be the service payment token of choice thus increasing ADA demand and creating upward pressure on Cardano price.

05/Oct/20 4:46 PM,322288,1501,Jeronimo Backes,"@Community Member  no exchange or trading is used to make this work. Stores can set their prices in fiat or ada. If they choose fiat, upon checkout the total order price in fiat will be converted to the equivalent token market price according to the preferred price estimation method chosen by the store:

\* average price among a group of sources such as (binance + coinbase + whatever) / 3.

\* Moving average of the last X minutes/hours/whatever  

\* External service provided by the store.  

So of the order total is 50USD and the price of ADA is 0.1 USD, the system will expect the client to pay 500ADA within a give time frame (also determined by the store), or else the order will be automatically cancelled.  

If any jurisdiction prohibits this mechanism of conversion then stores in that jurisdiction should not use this solution. Dealing with this is out of scope for now. I can add support for trading on an exchange on behalf of the store later on (I built a framework to program automated trading bots here: https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-trader, it would not be hard for me to use this code to exchange one thing for another)

Dear Daniel,

Thank you a lot for the great feedback. This proposal was in Fund1 and to be honest, I hesitated to submit it for the Fund2 for the reasons that there are many proposals already and that the amount of ADA needed is relatively big.

1\. I think Cardano Hub completely answers to this question -""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"".

Cardano Hub might be the place where entrepreneurs and developers meet, communicate, create.

These days it seems everything is possible to do online, but if it's a matter of big project or big investment - probably people would like to meet in person. That's why such Hub should exist, and maybe it will be firstly implemented in another country and location.

More particular steps will include: meetup series about Cardano, business opportunities in crypto, Haskell courses.

2\. Yes, the ideal option would be to buy property. Also the amount is relatively big, as Cardano Hub should be setup to work for the long-term.

If I will see that proposal fails, but has good feedback and responses (like the one from you), I will change it, change the budget, and will submit it for Fund3, Fund5, Fund88, etc.

Also by submitting this proposals, I might find partners or just the people who would like to be part of it. Right now I don't have the fund to start it myself, but in some time I might be able to do it with my own funds (I just need more clients for marketing or to do some successful trading).

As an option we can tokenize Cardano Hub (on Cardano blockchain) when it becomes available, after Goguen

3\. Thank you for this advice as well.

I have another proposal on Cardano media projects (with the amount of funds suggested by Charles Hoskinson), if it's successful, I will start doing many podcasts, and to build Cardano-based media.

After some time, when I meet more and more people from the Cardano ecosystem (I met already great people at Fund1) - we can think on this idea - how to move it forward - by Project Catalyst, by tokenized investment, by loan, by income from another projects...

Hi Nick,

The idea around this proposal is to achieve the proof-of-concept and narrow the scope to just a turn-based, decentralized multiplayer RPG. Down the road, outside the scope of Fund2's funding pool, I envision that the framework that we build to make this game happen can be lifted and be used as a framework for games to incorporate blockchain technology in the future. Though Godot's Enjin SDK does implement some blockchain features like an integrated wallet and tokenization, our focus us to create an entire game on the chain itself, similar to how CryptoKitties does it with having most of their code running on the chain.

Your idea bout character progression and using assets from an old game to migrate to a newer one is a concept we have already thought about and would be a great thing to add, once we get there. First, we would like to have a working prototype and would use the funding to get started on that.",NO
05/Oct/20 3:49 AM,322909,1632,mstopka,"This proposal also has synergies with Decentralized Software Updates project run by IOG for Cardano and co-funded by the EU project PRIViLEDGE! We hope we can be a good home to Cardano related source-code and assciated metadata! If you like our proposal please give the linked GH Issue below a 👍

05/Oct/20 3:10 AM,323886,1795,jason.clark.durham,"@wiggims  Hello and thank you for your feedback. The internet is broken. It currently cannot scale to levels needed for a blockchain to have the necessary transactions needed for a global financial system. Scalability is one of the three pillars Cardano addresses as a required functionality for a global blockchain. RINA is a software defined networking solution and it can run over legacy hardware but there are new hardware solutions being developed and tested that will greatly increase performance. If we have Cardano's blockchain running over RINA, it will be the 1st blockchain in the world to do so and below are some metrics showing the benefits.

The number of distinct protocols and mechanisms required to deliver the equivalent core functionality of TCP/IP and RINA are compared thus:

Protocols: Internet – 15; RINA – 3

Non-security mechanisms: Internet – 89; RINA – 15

Security mechanisms: Internet – 28; RINA – 7

The simplicity speaks for itself. The benefits of the RINA approach are numerous:

Scalability. The recursive structure scales indefinitely. No more router table size explosion.

Security. Each layer is a securable container, and most of your firewalls, session border controllers and intrusion systems disappear. No more port scanning, much less scope for mischief.

Performance. The overheads of routing are far lower, the algorithms can be implemented simply in silicon.

Manageability. You can swap out protocols and mechanisms at lower layers without upper layers knowing or caring. Reconfigure your data centre whilst it is running!

Flexibility. You can implement any and all QoS mechanisms within the architecture, not just 'best effort', and (if the mechanism supports it) create a composable trading system for allocating resources according to any policy you see fit.

Reliability. Multi-homing goes from being complex to trivial. Reliability is ordinary, not outrageously hard.

Mobility. No more complexity to address mobility as a special case: it falls straight out of the architecture. You can shred a lot of your 3GPP standards, too.

Cost. No more hacks-upon-hacks. This is the minimal 'necessary and sufficient' amount of functionality needed.

I hope this helps.",NO

You are right. The current proposal does not include information on how it would leverage Cardano.  
Other than mentioning this ""Definitely would like to make an interoperable token for the marketplace""

My goal was to get the idea out here and see if it is something that could have value.

Non-fungible tokens (NFT) will be additional features that are built into the game editor. Game creators can choose to issue such assets.

Should it all this information stay off-chain or some part of validated by the mainchain? I have no answers.

I did not add this information to the proposal because at my current knowledge, I have not yet understood how we would be able to create an NFT token with no fees.  
Tokens could represent a high score, item, player information, etc.  
I now see I should still mention such plans, even if I am not sure how to go about it.

  

**Another way to look at this** is the number of tutorials and guides that will come out of this project.  
How to set up a server, how to read documentation, how to use GIT, how to configure features, how to write scripts, etc.

All these do not directly boost the Cardano economy but give new people access to knowledge that could be used to create all kinds of games.

Since this project would be funded by Project Catalyst there will be several ways to market the existence of Cardano and get more people involved from different both game creators and gamer communities.

In addition, we could set up ADA bounties to solve or create some features.  
We could create hackathons to create modular minigames on the engine and reward with ADA.

  

**A bigger picture regarding the NFT tokens.**It would be a complementary addition if someone else creates a marketplace for pixel art the way we could create a seamless interaction with the marketplace within the object editor.

  

**Let me know if I am wrong.**  
I think first we should create a product where people can start making games.  
Then we add features to make the game assets and information interoperable with the Cardano chain.",NO

04/Oct/20 1:32 PM,322961,1638,Robert O'Brien,"@tefera  you certainly do not want an Aadhaar type of system. Unfortunately, it is appealing and easier to understand for governments. A centrally managed system like Aadhaar is like leading a proverbial government duck to water. What compounds this is that SSI is still very new so there is certainly no best practice manual. With one caveat, what we're essentially talking about is governance over a shared resource- our collective identity as a digital data commons.  
  
That is a slightly broader interpretation of digital identity than even SSI. It is more attuned with the notion of Economic Identity, where \*economics\* is a reference to our collective interactions- past, present, and future. And views privacy as **information flow rules-in-use**, a process view rather than a stock to be accessed and potentially depleted. Think about rules-in-use in terms of digital rights expressions and smart-contracts/intelligent agents that help enforce them. This is why I have been, and continue to be, so bullish on blockchains and Cardano in particular. They are enablers of systems that account for our interactions in the past, present, and into the future.  
  
At least with Prism it will provide a basis for starting a conversation in a way people can relate to. Even just getting people to use the Prism demo is a great starting point. But it is only a starting point. It would be better if another Prism demo was done that focused on being relevant to indigenous cultures. Oral societies and their communal systems of governance have a far richer, nuanced notion of information privacy where contextual rules-in-use (pun intended) rule. Showing how technology can solve their problems, not just the government and the private sector would be great. I've been involved with a number of projects in NZ to advance these ideas for some time, in particular, with Māori. That work is similar to your engagement with community organizers etc. However, it takes a while.  
  
If there is a handbook of best practise then it is the work of Elinor Ostrom. For example, as just one starting point into her work, you could start with *Understanding Knowledge as a Commons From Theory to Practice*. There are many more, however, her material is mostly academic so requires some interpretation into the digital and local context. Vlad Tarko's *Elinor Ostrom An Intellectual Biography* is a good overview of her work. Brett Frischmann has a number of publications (books and papers) that explore the information flow notion of privacy with the same Commons/Public Goods lens. e.g. https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jinfopoli.8.2018.0116#metadata_info_tab_contents

Yes, of course, my goal for this proposal at the start was to see if there would be any interest at all before I go into heavy detail.

As for the beginning, I think it would wise to start where the current open-source engine has reached.  
Then from point A to point B we literally take less than a day.

The engine is missing a proper Client.  
There are currently two open-source clients which work. Open Tibia Client and Unity Client.  
Last time I checked the open versions had several issues. (There are repos where these problems are fixed)

As for now, the assets which are used on this engine are stolen.  
So there is a huge need for the designer or AI expert to draw 32x32 pixel picture assets.  
Several years ago estimated it would cost about 4000euros to create GAN and RL model which could take in high-quality pictures and convert them into 32x32 or higher pixel versions. I did not calculate in the time I would spend to create the model and only the cost to get an artist to create the expected outputs.

  

The time-consuming part is to create the documentation.  
The engine itself has some outdated video tutorials. There should be guides for all operating systems. Right now it takes a lot of effort to set up everything, but it all could be automated.

Then I have not seen a good overview of how the game base feature structure looks like and how it all works.  
We definitely need it for adoption.

  

The next layer on top of that is the custom modules, systems, and features I have created.  
Some of these logics should be written into the source because they will lag the system (example: monster pathfinding)

  

Once we have free assets, documentation, tutorials, proper tools to create the game and play the game.  
After the MVP is built and documented, we can start thinking, how to build the same system on a better tech stack.",NO

1.  **everybody** (including me :laughing: ) would be able to create an app or web site to research & develop Delegation Portfolios, using your API
2.  **all these apps/sites** could then export that Delegation Portfolio for easy setup in the wallet, using this URI standard.

Imaging research apps like yours (more flexible and feature oriented than the existing ""pool tools"") was one reason I added that ""automation & integration"" category of use cases. The URI standard makes it possible for anyone to produce a delegation portfolio, and your API allows anyone to create novel uses of the pool data that you are collating.

Thank you, Robert, for the detailed answer.

I am from Ethiopia. The country has no standard ID system but recently, the central government signed an MOU with an Indian company to run a pilot for a centralized identity system, which is alarming news in a country prone to dictatorship.

I asked IOG to engage civil organizations and regional governments with an SSI offer as they are less bureaucratic than the central government. But I am realizing that this may be a community activism issue than for IOG as they have not managed to convince the central government to use Prism, though they have been in Ethiopia for some years.

I am in contact with community organizers, church leaders, political leaders, and media personalities, introducing them to SSI and plan to hold a workshop once Prism is operational.

But clearly, it seems I need to understand more about privacy and other implications.

Hi Daniel,

In general, you can have the best technology in the space but without a strong user base, it is useless. We are sure that developers can build applications on Cardano but developers also need to know that there will be users willing to play with the applications. Social media is a strong player in attracting users. Blockchain technology can be a bit scary for many newcomers and it is necessary to explain to people that there is nothing to be scared of. The same is true for business. Everybody who needs more information can either contact CF, IOG, Emurgo, or use Google and find articles about the project. It holds true for users and also for business. The more articles available on the internet the more relevant the projects will look. Interviews with team members or technical articles can help a lot in forming public opinion.

I myself do not have the game development, only software engineering experience but have colleagues who are experienced software engineers who are currently in the gaming industry today.

I took a look at Neon District and they seem to be running quite an extensive 3-D engine for their gaming platform, and have highlighted the use of NFTs for their in-game assets.

No doubt, for a fully polished product with a rich gaming experience, a larger team of engineers will be required to handle such a large scope. For us, I think a simple proof-of-concept is doable within the short time-frame, but it will not have the real-time graphics rendering what you see with Neon District. It will likely start being entirely text-based for the PoC.

The PoC implementation is laid out in the high-level block diagram and should fulfill the front and back-end portion of the gaming framework at its basic core.

What differentiates us from Neon District is that we're trying to encapsulate the entire game state (your actions) on the chain. This has a consequence of the player requiring to sign transactions (and paying its fee) for each player action that will evolve their game state. The beauty of this is that your character progression will never be taken away from you, since it lives on the chain forever. Think of it as a save file for your character that will live on the chain, but the saves occur for every action you make.",NO

Our ask of 350,000 ada is an approximation for hiring one senior developer or possibly two less senior developers for 3-4 months at market rates in France (rates are lower here than in the US, but associated social costs add up). We're currently a team of two full-time members and one part-time; only one of whom is a developer. As such, we expect to be at limited capacity when adding a third blockchain (Cardano) to our environment in our current situation. To provide some more detail, for example, developing additional bitcoin features already takes a lot of time as there's less native functionality and tooling available.

As you noted, we do have a business model in place, but we're not generating enough revenue from which to support an additional team member in the four months we've been offering our service. Additionally, our expenses in the past two months have unexpectedly increased due to the recent sharp rise in gas fees on Ethereum. So our short-term aim by offering another non-Ethereum-based crypto-asset ASAP is to lower these costs. And given the strong potential for growth in the Cardano ecosystem once smart contracts are introduced, in the longer term, we see ada as a strong alternative to offer our users, who tend not to have strong preferences to any one blockchain or cryptocurrency and only seek efficiency.

Good evening Daniel.

Thank you so much for taken the time to react on my idea. Let me address your points one by one and see if I can lessen your doubts.

1) As I mentioned in my own reaction on the idea, I believe that we have a huge group of potential developers that does not even know we exist. The wallet-lottery is aiming at two goals (three if you add the charity funding).

a. to create awareness and an accessible way for people to attend the wallet lottery and by doing so creating a financial ID.

b. within that group of attendees there are for sure developers who are then introduced into the wonderful world of Cardano. I will not be surprised if the first attendees consist mostly of technical oriented people. But I might be wrong in that assumption.

2) I am sorry about the confusion of the funding. My mistake.

The intention is to get the majority of the 10 million ADA by pledging. (Maybe I am using the wrong terminology here?) What I mean is that people can invest in the wallet-lottery and create a ROI. See my example calculation where 1% is giving back to the pledgers (again, this might be the wrong word). The 10 million is not the seed capital.

We do however need seed capital for setting up operations:

a. Writing a marketing plan and recruit local people (50) in Asia and Africa (order to be decided). The local sales force is for expanding the marketing in Asia and Africa by creating awareness and support attendees with applying for the wallet-lottery (and by doing so, creating a financial ID).

b. Building the app including the smart contracts for keeping things as transparent as possible. Every single ADA should be accounted for.

c. A pilot to interest potential pledgers/investors

Given my entrepreneurial and charity experience in the Philippines for about 14 years now, I think we will be needing about 40.000 USD (400.000 ADA) to cover 6 months of costs:

• 50 local marketeers/sales force á 100 USD per month for 4 months (see timeline below)

• recruitment of those 50 people

• provide them with marketing / sales materials

• building the app and pilot

3) Timeline

• Month 1 – 3

Recruiting the 50 local marketeers / sales force in Asia and/or Africa.

• Month 3 – 6

Local marketeers / sales force persuading locals to create a wallet for the lottery. I am thinking of giving every attendee an incentive of 5 ADA, only to be spend on the wallet-lottery (smart contract). People without a financial ID are mostly poor. A small incentive can get us a great way.

The wallet-lottery will cost 1 ADA to attend. Meaning they can participate 4 times and hopefully find enough motivation to continue afterwards. With 50 local marketeers/salesforce we aim at about 1 to 2,000,000 attendees in 6 months. Cost: 10 million ADA (hence the pledgers/investors).

• Month 1 - 3

Writing the marketing plan and building the app. We have 2 experienced programmers now studying Haskell, Plutus, Marlowe. I have applied for testing Marlowe, since I am also a SME on finance. However it would be great to get support from within our community!

• months 4 -6

Testing, testing, testing

• Month 7:

Launch of the first wallet lottery (to be continued on a weekly basis)

02/Oct/20 7:43 PM,324335,1870,rphair,"@sebastiengllmt  thanks for answering… I just spent some time responding to another question about the budget. Some of that is now irrelevant based on your own response. All I care about is that the budget accurately reflects the amount of work that is necessary and possible to do. I'd be happiest it if were a ₳10K technical writing & research job. Yet without knowing the state of prior work it had to allow for all possibilities.

This system (Ideascale) does not appear flexible enough to attach any such revision to the proposal. If multi-wallet delegation is also months away then the project period may not be compatible with the prerequisites… this possibility also came up in that long response I wrote in the last hour. If I have a chance to revise the budget & scope of work based on your & other reviewers' suggestions I will certainly do so.

The 6-month target for multi-wallet delegation has not been prominently mentioned anywhere. If these details are mentioned in videos alone, we won't be able to follow them. I will trust that the CIP will come across your desk soon, if not already, and we'll stay tuned that way while we get additional feedback via this proposal… which will help satisfy the discussion requirement of that CIP. :sunglasses:",NO
02/Oct/20 7:26 PM,324335,1870,rphair,"@daniel.ribar  thank you, and apologies for repeating some references, links & quotes because as you have seen the Ideascale system has split the proposal outline into two pieces. These may not be continuous, depending on the order in which you're displaying comments. \[**edit 14 Oct 2020** *this editing problem was fixed on 04 October ... and today (before proposal closure) the rest of this comment included, for ease of reading, as BUDGET & RESPONSIBILITY DETAILS*\]  

1) First of all, *the budget for this project could actually be **zero*** if this implementation is accepted as a Cardano Improvement Proposal. We still don't know what the timetable for implementing these CIPs will be and we may have to wait for Governance to be achieved on Cardano before people can really vote on them. You can follow the discussion about that proposal here:

https://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-stake-uri-scheme-for-pools-delegation-portfolios/40594

… and with eventual participation from the developers this is the best place to ask questions about the schedule & contingency issues I'm trying to anticipate & describe below.

The budget, which I've assumed is an estimate pending final approval and vote, should be enough for six months of daily (half-time?) work to:

\- communicate daily with IOG and/or Emurgo developers as the necessary issues for implementing the URI standard in Daedalus and Yoroi are created and progressed.

\- anticipate integration issues with other software and tools (e.g. hardware wallets that operate through a browser and also need to support the same URI syntax).

\- develop an API document for the URI standard, with implementation guidelines for various software environments, to be used by outside developers.

I'm not including ""community outreach"" in this list because: if the related CIP and/or this Catalyst proposal are accepted by the community, we can assume the community itself will find ways of utilising the URI standard however it might develop. If and when suggestions come in spontaneously, I will catalogue them so they can be considered by the developers.

Comments made on the CIP, which have recently begun to come in, will help identify integration issues (wallets, operating systems, mobile phone environments) which will serve as checklist items to run through daily until met as much as possible. The best we can hope for is that the major wallets like Daedalus, Yoroi and perhaps the most compliant exchanges supporting Cardano staking will implement this standard… then the rest of them can be relied upon to follow suit.

Leading into answer #2 below, I estimate a 6-month implementation period to cover the major implementations, for which a part-time salary of ₳10K ada per month (currently $1000) will cover the vast number of variables as best as possible. I think it's reasonable to focus on Daedalus, Yoroi, a representative exchange, and the most popular hardware wallet and cover the rest as time permits. \[**edit 04 Oct 2020**: This figure is half what was listed in original proposal, due to a refining statement of work.\]

Again, since this proposal is mainly to open a door to discussion with IOG, Emurgo and the Cardano Foundation, I have no idea in which direction the responsibility could be established… I doubt Cardano wallet developers would take ""orders"" from an outside agent, so the best we could hope for is that I would catalogue the integration issues, document then rigorously on Github and in other company communications, and make sure they are progressed in order for the URIs to be implemented as early in that 6-month schedule as possible.

The six-month target, if it were to begin with the Fund2 disbursement, might correspond closely to the point at which Cardano PoS is fully decentralised (d = 0). At that point we will have a true picture of how greatly the stake will be concentrated without any incentives or tools for decentralising that stake. We should also be launching DeFi applications at that point, with Cardano taking on the load that is currently crippling Ethereum.

That should not be the point at which people suddenly start thinking about how to decentralise rewards, profitability & productivity among a wider variety of SPOs. At least with this proposal we will have at least one way, hopefully ready before that date & in 6 months at the latest, to make it as easy as possible for the community & network to redistribute stake.

If there is person or team in IOG / Emurgo / CF who will step forward and say they have that same responsibility, that would be good enough for me… all they'd need to do is publicly commit to that responsibility and then we wouldn't need this proposal. Until such a commitment is made, this proposal arranges for such a person to be there.

2) For the second question, the support of multi-pool delegation in Cardano wallets is a strict dependency of this proposal. I've attempted to get some clarity about this issue in this very recent comment, from perhaps the best source of information out there. The time relationships as I see it are:

a) If we wait for a full implementation of multi-pool delegation (in Daedalus first I would think), it will be provided as before in a monolithic means without any support for community-produced delegation lists. This proposal is a way of forcing consideration of the issue by wallet developers even though it cannot be implemented under the current conditions. If we wait for the UI and integration to be worked out without community input in favour of crowdsourced delegation portfolios, it'll be too late.

b) If the timing isn't right, and the presumed 6-month lifecycle of this project begins *before* that prerequisite is met, **the funding should be held in abeyance**, OR (I would hope not) the project would be cancelled and would have to apply for funding all over again, OR in the intervening period the wallet software developers will realise the vital importance of this feature and will implement it at their own expense with the full resources of IOG / Emurgo behind them.

3) Therefore that's my biggest concern. None of these questions can be answered precisely without knowing how quickly they could implement this on their own, how they perceive the need for user-generated delegation portfolios (if at all), and whether their developers could work with a developer or project manager outside their organisation. The biggest variable is how much those companies are willing to communicate about the issue.

My worry is that they might not, and I hope I am wrong… it's anticipating that worst case scenario that this proposal is here, so the community can vote to insist upon on this feature as a priority, should the CIP and all other methods fail. The budget cannot be any more than a guess until we know what level of cooperation we would eventually have.",NO

02/Oct/20 6:55 PM,323841,1787,Miroslav.retkovsky,"Hello Daniel,

Thank you very much for reading my proposal and for your feedback,I know it takes time and energy to read my proposal and think about it and then write a good feedback as you did, I really appreciate it!

\---------------------------------------------------------------

My idea was about creating marketplace where creative professionals could sell their work for ADA, or just share it.

3D printing would provide option to sell their design also as physical product not only digital. I shared https://www.turbosquid.com/ because this is example where people sell their 3D models.

Next step would be providing option to purchase subscriptions for softwares used in creative industry such as CAD, 3DsMA or photogrammetry apps and photoshop etc. This will attract software companies to join and offer their products.

This could be platform with transactions using smart contracts on daily basis.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

I dont have skills and experience to make it by myself and funding should be used for paying developers to make this marketplace reality.

I know that marketing agency could ask 8000USD for one year, I actually do marketing for my company by myself and spent almost nothing.

I dont know how much could cost to make website like this. And I hoped that some experience person will be willing to tell me some

3D printing service make this project more complicated, because 3D printing is difficult, thats why the website I shared and its competitors dont provide 3D printing and only alow selling digital products. Therefore this part could be removed.

But I mentioned how much it would cost if 3D printing would be provided. Formlab 3D printer costs about 5000USD, this is relatively cheaper printer but it is suitable for start and to not have too high costs for beginnig.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

about a) b), this is what I also wanted to discuss with someone experienced, whether it will be feasible to track staking. But I am going to definitelly read all content provided by IOG and learn from it.

And about initial content, so yes, goal is to not have to pay lots of money for content, so I have to find out whether it is possible to just reshare free content from other websites. But I also hoped that somebody who knows how existing websites where people share creative content started and give me some advice.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

Road map:

1\. Website with initial content with option to share and purchase creative content with ADA.

2\. Add 3D printing service for users

3\. Marketing on social media, I have 3D printing page on FB with 800 followers and linkedin page with 630 and linkedin profile with over 5000 followers with 0 USD spent. So I could you this for promoting as well.

4.Promote staking experience for users so they can use rewards for purchases on the website.

5.Provide option to purchase software subscriptions

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

Goal is to bring creative professionals to cardano from traditional market, so they will buying and selling creative work within cardano ecosystem. They will also stake ADA and use rewards on the website.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

I started already learing smart contracts, haskell, plutus and marlowe but for now I am not able to do anything yet. I hope one day I will make something by myself.

\------------------------------------------------------------------

  

Anyway, I undestand that there is lot of doubt and that it is probably not good candidate for funding.

First of all I am very greatfull for every honest feedback and advice,

I want to learn as much as possible now and I hope that with small steps I will be able to build something within cardano by myself one day.

  

Thank you very much for feedback and I wish you all the best!

Miro",NO
02/Oct/20 6:53 PM,324335,1870,sebastiengllmt,"Although I agree something like this would be nice, in practice URI schemes are very hard to work with and have really poor support by Chrome & mobile devices (Firefox works well though). As you mentioned, Yoroi already supports payment URLs through a URI scheme, but there has been little usage of this feature due to the usage hurdle (the good news is that many Yoroi Extension users already registered the web+cardano URL).

For Yoroi Mobile, it's useful without the URI scheme support since what we really cared about was being able to scan QR codes that contain web+cardano as the QR code content. Similarly, a way to scan a pool QR code would be nice.

  

My main concern with this proposal is what you would do with the 120000 ADA, since clearly this would have to be implemented in Yoroi (open source) and in explorers (mostly closed source). You could spend the time to help us integrate this into Yoroi to cover the cost if you want, but you probably can't get push permission for explorer codebases. 120000 ADA would be a fairly high cost for integrating this in Yoroi given that we (EMURGO) have already done most of the work required to set this up already.

  

Additionally, multiple pool delegation is probably at least half a year away if not more so I don't think the multi-pool aspect of this proposal will help anybody anytime soon.",NO

I like the concept in general, but the deliverables need a bit of work. I agree that creating a solid business plan with a nice roadmap is a must, but in addition to that you would need to include some product deliverables.

Say, if you want to implement feature A, then you can divide the whole project into modules and request funds to cover 25% of development costs for that feature. Your proposal would have to include KPIs for that portion of work so the community could track your success rate. This would be crucial in evaluating your request to fund the next portion of the project, which you may do for fund 3+",NO

Hi Daniel,

I think enabling a library to easily sign Cardano transactions on one of the most popular embedded development IDE platforms is a good way to encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build

I plan to use the funds to feed myself and my family, and possibly incentivize assistance to enable focus on the build.

It's a small build out which involves accepting, encrypting and storing a key to flash, accepting a built transaction file, retrieving, decrypting, signing and storing output. It's not a terribly complicated build and will be done anyways - the outcome of this proposal will simply determine whether I can afford/divert the extra time/effort to build out a library for all to use.",NO

I appreciate your concerns, and I think it's important for the community to understand my intentions. Understanding real-word implementation provides insight as to the applications this type of library would enable.",NO
02/Oct/20 6:07 PM,324335,1870,rphair,"@rcmorano  yes, thanks & based on that promising video that many of us have watched, I've been waiting for @sebastiengllmt  to chime in on the original proposal where it was drafted before being submitted as a CIP:

https://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-stake-uri-scheme-for-pools-delegation-portfolios/40594

… and I'd also be very happy to hear from him here; at some point his input will be crucial :pray: … He was also the one who first responded to the original request, dating back 2½ years now, to honour URI links to payment addresses, in which that feature request author suggested (without response or any further pursuit) that they support stake addresses as well:

https://github.com/input-output-hk/daedalus/issues/883#issuecomment-384121619

So those involved in payment URIs have been aware of the need for these URIs for some time. The major wallet developers not provided this yet would be a complex of these factors: 1) other development priorities, 2) lack of consensus, 3) major stakeholders behind the main communication channels don't benefit from providing survival options to smaller pools, and 4) the top-heavy stake distribution currently benefits IOG more than anyone (i.e. the major stakeholders have no need to see ""small pools"" supported)…

https://adapools.org/groups

This proposal will take care of #1 and #2 but issues #3 and #4 will have to be overcome **by popular demand**. At over ₳2 billion ADA rewards in 2021, times 15% conglomerated IOG stake, times an average 5% margin, that's at least **₳15 million** in 2021 paid in IOG pool margin even after the stake pool network is ""decentralised.""

The budget for this project is insignificant compared those conglomerated rewards received so far even in these early days. But *everyone* holding Ada would benefit from ADA going up along with popular perceptions of a more diversified, increasingly robust set of PoS nodes. And If ""other development priorities"" (#1) are a constraint, then this Catalyst proposal would coordinate a solution and perhaps even budget the software solution itself.

Still, because of this potential conflict of interest, *you'll also have to go to the forum link*, where you *and all small pool operators* can support the CIP without worrying it'll compete with your own pursuit of Project Catalyst funding :innocent:

https://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-stake-uri-scheme-for-pools-delegation-portfolios/40594

You're absolutely right that this idea keeps being invented independently by many of us, because it's so badly needed by the majority. We're already composing such URIs in our heads & wishing we could use them somehow. But without a budget & dedicated point person to pursue this goal, from past observations this will remain on the ""wish list"" forever and we might continue with *only centralised options for delegation and pool promotion* for Cardano's entire formative period.

*p.s.* I've made a note to check the FreeDesktop integration is eventually included in the spec, as your Tweet suggests, which in this context would be handled by registering the URI scheme in the installer & including the corresponding MIME type in the launcher… plus whatever that corresponds to in Windows, etc. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:",NO

Thank you for putting together your proposal. Appreciated.

Would you be able to outline how the budget works for your particular proposal? I am unsure I can make sense of it at the moment. I had to scroll through comments to find some of it - not ideal - granted - some ideascale limitation you've encountered. You mention there it would become a part time salary of sorts. How long do you reckon will the funds requested by enough for? What happens if the money runs out before project is delivered?

Thank you for sharing with us your proposal.

Your idea of hiring additional developer is intriguing. However, I am not seeing any specifics as why 350,000 ADA is the right amount. Is this purely hours/salary for one person to work on this extension?

What happens to the developer once the funds are used up - do we know for how long will this be able to sustain this new hire? Is there a timeline that you can share with us?

As I understood from your web presentation - you already have a working business plan. Is it not able to support an additional team member to work on Cardano integration? What is your current team size? I am curious at trade-offs here.

Overall, not a bad idea - but I am missing more substance from the proposal to be able to consider viability.

02/Oct/20 5:27 PM,324242,1855,Daniel Ribar,"Hello Lukas,

Hope you are well. I second few of the concerns listed in the comments section here.

1\. It would be great to clarify the terms. As pointed above there are some differences between various ERC tokens and it wouldn't be ideal to get these mixed up.

2\. I am also curious as how this intertwines with the ERC converter that has been talked about so heavily from IOG side? Is this something that builds atop of it, adds along side to it, or entirely new concept? I can't wrap my head around it just quite.

3\. To touch upon specific goals section - I am afraid they are rather general in theme. E.g. to make community bigger - but what does that mean specifically? How do we get to that state?  

4\. Knowing how delays are quite common - your deliverables are tied to smart contract deployment. Do you have an idea what happens if this is delayed? What's the plan in such scenario?

I think it would make sense to split the proposal into two stages in funding as well then - 1st to get Tatum and Cardano friendly - and then 2nd once you can do the smart contract layer conversion live. Otherwise - we may be waiting a while.

If it all works out - would make sense to return in the future to continue funding the second leg of this project.

1\. Content: I would like to see a game that teaches people about financial concepts and how the economy works. I think it could be both popular and beneficial… sort of like monopoly but tailored to the developing world. If players earn ADA in the process, it will probably be even more popular.

2\. Funding: You need to update your requested funds to show the amount in ADA and for this round of funding only. Say if you want financing to fund 3 months of work then give that amount and cut down the scope and key milestones to fit that timeline. if you are successful you can always come back for more. Asking $60K right off the bat may reduce your chances of getting funded because we have only $250K and you would be competing with other relevant projects.

Thank you for your submission - this looks like potentially a very good use of funds.

1\. I am thinking you could add a bit more colour explaining how it fits into current theme *""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""*

2\. Would like to understand how are the funds going to be deployed. Presently, I have no firm understanding what the funds are going to be used for. A break down would be helpful to get some insight.

3\. Lastly, I see timeline is set at about 2-3 months. Are there specific milestones within these time frames that you wish to hit? Are there any issues that you foresee that could affect your deliverable?

Your reasoning about the goals of this project and therefore what it should emphasize is spot on. Thank you for elucidating these ideas, you have done me a great service. I'm thrilled to have poked your brain, and you have returned the favor.

And to your questions -- all are relevant, and over the next few days I'll make sure to incorporate answers to each in the web site and the proposal.

While I put together more detailed and thoughtful responses to your questions, quick coming attractions: months 1-2 are about developing the framework, local outreach, and some simple resources that help to illustrate the idea, ***and*** building a team. By the time Fund 4 rolls around, I'd like to submit a more substantial proposal that includes funding the work of that team. If you have any interest in contributing, I'd be interested in having a chat sometime soon - let me know by DM'ing here on Ideascale or finding the #cardano-starter-kits channel on the Catalyst Discord: https://discord.gg/tgcVvNx

02/Oct/20 2:39 PM,323284,1700,Daniel Ribar,"Hello Andrii,

Thank you for your submission. This sounds like an amazing opportunity.

However, few things I'd think can make it even better.

1\. Aligning your mission statement in line with the fund2 challenge theme ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""Would you be able to shed more light how this is in line with the mission of it? I didn't get that sense immediately but I think it can help you a lot moving forward.

2\. With above - my biggest concern is the amount of funds requested. Have you thought in greater details how these funds shall be dispersed and how will they help achieve the goal of the proposal? I see number 888,888 ADA and I can't help myself if it should be taken seriously or? Breaking it down would make most sense.

I understand that your proposal suggests to purchase property directly to minimise running costs. If that's the venue you'd trying to pursue - I suggest adding a real estate canvas of the situation to have an understanding what's the pricing and availability of suitable properties. Heck, this even might be the first milestone to put into the roadmap.

3\. Which brings me to the timeline. I am unsure what timing concept is with regards to this proposal. Putting it down to actual timeline would be fantastic. It will help us keep tabs on the project as it progresses.

Thank you for your proposal - very much appreciated.

I have few doubts - I am hoping these could be addressed as you re-work the proposal.

1\. The current fund2 challenge theme is ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""Would you be able to shed more light how this is in line with the mission of it? That would be grand.

3\. Sense of timeline would be useful, too. I am not sure how much time this project needs nor when individual goals be due. It may help think about these to make this project more likely to proceed.

Thanks for your reply. I am busy working on a proof of concept which I will be releasing hopefully in the next couple of days a couple of technical issues. My efforts has been focused on that rather than the detail of the proposal I do acknowledge it needs more detail however there was not much guidance at the time and we had to get something submitted. And I think the best way to get across an idea is by providing a POC.

However to answer your question how will I get from point A (proof of concept) to point B (then). I will be using the proof of concept to establish that milestones along side this I will be asking for feedback for feature requests from users of that proof of concept. https://cutt.ly/cardanomobile-survey. This will then help me to establish timelines and roadmap and costs of development.

Once I have launched the proof of concept I will come back to the documents others have shared to provide some more detail.

Hope this makes sense.

Secondly, I see you already have a fund amount in mind. That's great first step towards more refined budget. Would you be able now to look into greater detail how these funds are going to be dispersed.

02/Oct/20 1:58 PM,322213,1457,Daniel Ribar,"Hello Nitemagi,

Thank you for your work on this proposal. I have a question -

Since the theme of this Fund2 Challenge round is ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"" - could you elaborate on the angle of this proposal and how ti touches upon this goal? I think that would be really helpful.

On the second note - you are asking for a considerate amount of ADA. Yet, I have poor understanding of how these resources are going to be deployed. Would you be able to re-shape the proposal so that it can bring some clarity?

Daniel",NO
02/Oct/20 1:53 PM,323359,1720,Caso,"Thanks @daniel.ribar  for supporting the idea,

I'll detail each point.

1\. The idea does not strictly fit the purpose of a dapp or the business itself. It is just a tool to help the community understand. So, I understand that it is not a priority, so I do not expect it to top the ideas list.

2\. In the first instance I showed the calendar to all Cardano explorers (via twitter), such as Pooltool or Adapools but they were unfazed, I did not receive any comments or feedback, so they are not interested.

Adding this calendar in the wallets would be fine, but I think it is better to go further and give the option of being able to implement the tool on any web. In addition, with the possibility of customizing the calendar with the ticker of your choice.

3 & 4. The question about the amount of funds was not easy. Taking into account the average ADA price for the last few months, ADA 20,000 equals $ 2,000, which is a normal/common monthly salary for a computer engineer.

The development will be for two months from the receipt of the funds. 10,000 ADA / 1,000 $ per month, in which the following activities will be developed:

Month 1: 1000 ADA

\- Server development, with Nodejs, Expressjs, PostgreSQL.

\- Front development, with Reactjs.

\- Unit tests.

Month 2: 1000 ADA

\- Github repository and documentation.

\- Tutorial to implement your own Calendar on your website.

  

\* The fund does not cover server costs.

\* If the proposal goes ahead, I will create a new idea(fund3) to convert the calendar into an iFrame, and thus adding the tool on the webs will be faster and easier.",NO
02/Oct/20 1:52 PM,323341,1714,Jay [DIVY],"@gjgeschiere  There are different definitions of what a successful podcast is. TCE is a great show, with quality information but ultimately with a limited audience. I definitely would want them to continue, but regarding this proposal, I'd want them to put forward a better financial plan first with tangible targets and KPIs that they can be accountable for. That would ultimately raise the questions of do we really need better audio and visual? What does improving the quality and the marketing of the podcast translate to in terms of viewers and followers? Is it really what will move the needle to get Cardano out there?

I agree with the solution of asking for less and a shorter timeframe so that the community can decide whether it was worth it and worth investing again rather than giving TCE a big lump sum with (currently) limited explanations given.",NO
02/Oct/20 1:50 PM,323341,1714,Todsy,"Personally I think 750,000 ADA is a lot for 6 months of weekly content - however you as the proposal creators know where and how you expect theses costs to be broken down. Could you provide a clear breakdown of cost allocations. As you're expecting us the community to fund it please show us the respect and transparency.

Secondly, I believe actions speak louder than words. So I would actually like to see in the proposal how previous funding from Cardano Foundation has helped improve the channel. I would even like to go further and ask the foundation what the allocated budget is for the Cardano Effect to see if the 750,000 is proportionate and appropriate.

Please understand this is 100% due diligence - if you're willing to ask for 1/3 of the current funding you need to provide more transparency and details otherwise this looks incredibly dubious.

I myself do not know the work that goes into Youtube channel / research pre interview and post interview and I would majority do not as well so please be willing to explain with numbers how these are allocated.",NO
02/Oct/20 1:49 PM,323977,1817,Tevo,"@wolstaeb 

Ok, we are getting on to something here now.

You clearly have more knowledge about what kind of tools should be used and to be investigated for the problems that customers might have. Where I have assumptions you seem to have answers.

I see where I have failed with this proposal, I present the problem where I see a lack of tools presented in a single easy to access platform.

As for the solution, I tell we are going to make tools in the single platform.

However when I get into the first 6weeks, which is the entire funding round. I am not telling what tools there will be in the ERP platform and how to use them because I don't even know how to bridge the gap between the tools provided by Cardano and tools on which the platform will be made.

I can't right now edit the proposal, but I take from, I should be more targeted with my problem, because the current detailed plan does not address the problem very well.

I have been itching to get this idea out because for years I have been working in a position where I make modules and automation for ERP platforms or internal business processes.

The thing is, I am not the one who knows what the end result should be, the talented workers show me what they do, what they know, and what is the end result. After I see the process I start suggesting options that could be done, because in my eyes everything is just a giant database and functions between them.

Once a suggestion sticks I consult/hire developers to make the change happen.

However, most of the tools where we have great success are not the ones built on top of the existing platforms (example SAP) but outside of it, using the data from the platform database and importing it back in after the function has been completed.

This process made me dream about a single platform, where they have a browser page. They unload their data in and press a button. The platform will show them how the data will look after the process and give a reason why the data changes. Now they can edit data or go through with the full execution and receive and output, which they could hook up with their tools or take it as file and import into their system. That process also can be automated so the data flows seamlessly and the browser is just a place to monitor the activity.

The platform also provides a data storage service and a server if the customer doesn't want to own the hardware and doesn't want to use cloud servers.

I imagined the platform should be done with legacy technology, something like:

Objective C framework, MySQL database, python scripts, Nginx server, React for the front end.

The interoperable part with Cardano is something where I don't know the answer.

Where would the Marlowe, ExUTXO, Plutus fit in this framework?

Can they replace some parts of the tech stack, what benefits they give what problems they introduce?",NO
02/Oct/20 1:34 PM,323911,1798,Daniel Ribar,"Hello James,

Appreciate your efforts and thank you for your idea submission.

I fear, however, at it lacks considerate amount of detail presently to be able to review it in a meaningful way. Don't worry - nothing that can't be fixed.

Few things that come to my mind:  
  
1\. Current funding round theme is *""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""* Would you be able to develop few thoughts around how your proposal fits into this narrative? I think that will help people understand it a bit better.  

2\. Have you thought of break-down budget? I see you already have thought of a grand figure. That's great. Now - it would be helpful to break it down into chunks to see how it shall be deployed to advance your goal. I always think of it - you are in point A (now) and wish to get to point B (then). How are you going to get there? What tools and resources specifically are to be required?

3\. Having sense of a timeline also helps you to keep yourself accountable. Are you on track? Is this realistic or not?

These questions will help you bite deeper into the proposal and elevate it. The more you can think about your plans - better prepared you'll be for actually executing. Ideas are nice - but actions are better. Describe what actions are.

Looking forward how you work on this further.

I wish you best of luck,

Hi Rick

  

Thanks for your feedback.

What specific costs did you left out when reducing the 750k proposal to 640k?  
Without addressing cost specifications it just seems like a very arbitrary number.

Without indicating what that initial 110k difference was planned for, it feels like you just throw a big number on it, you got some resistance and again, arbitrarily reduce the number to 640k.

Can the attachment be updated to reflect the current fund proposal?  

  

You forward others and myself to the attachment for additional data.

The attachment has only one and a half page of actual info in it.  
General costs are broadly mentioned but nothing in specific. There is no financial plan/breakdown.

The document states ""All funds received will be marked as income and are taxed under the appropriate IRS tax code.""

This for example is a very important part! Many of us will overlook the fact that a significant % of the entire fund will go to taxes.  
Providing a cost breakdown where the line (example)""Estimated Tax provision: +-250.000 ADA"" very clearly shows an immediate different story. It's visual and people will be more likely to wrap their head around the large sum.  
It's small things like this which can be improved and would provide greater chance of your proposal being accepted.

  

With the data we currently have, to me it seems like the Cardano Effect is asking for an arbitrarily big fund while providing insufficient communication/data.

Using a clear SMART goal model + financial breakdown in the attachment would show proof of transparency, sincerity and specific goals.

  

I'm not saying that the Cardano Effect is not sincere. I'm a fan of your platform, but I feel that we are setting a standard here as to what documentation/communication is expected for fund proposals. We shouldn't give each other ADA just because we like each other. Lets approach this with more professionalism.",NO

1\. The theme of this fund2 challenge is ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"" Would you be able to elaborate how does this proposal fit into it and how you'd plan to align it with? I think that'd be helpful.

2\. I don't have firm understanding of budget spending. A bit more elaborate effort may be useful to bridge that gap a bit more.

3\. I checked milestones - appreciate having them - but I have no sense of how are you going to achieve these milestones specifically and what resources will need to be deployed specifically to make it happen. Looking into this and answering few of these questions can help elevate your roadmap substantially.

4\. I checked your slide deck - under executive team you have people listed. One of them has no description to who that person is and what their role on the project is. The advisory team also has a name - but no idea who that person is either. Meaning, worth looking over the slide deck and editing it for some inefficiencies - it will make it so much better.

I wonder though - what are the deliverables on this project? I think it is a good idea but it needs a bit more detail on how you plan to get from point A (now) to point B (project outcome).

You've mentioned it has potentially big pay-off while being risky endeavour. Would you be able to determine/elaborate further on both - risks and benefits that stems from this sort of research?

I assume it would be a research paper of sorts that addresses issues raised. Is there a sense of what 100,000 ADA covers specifically?

Thank you for your submission. Appreciated.

However, there are few things I don't quite understand.

1\. The theme of this fund2 challenge is ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"" Would you be able to elaborate how does this proposal fit into it and how you'd plan to align it with? I think that'd be helpful.

2\. I don't have firm understanding of budget spending. A bit more elaborate effort may be useful to bridge that gap a bit more. How much of resources a project like this needs - have you thought about it yet?

What I like is - that the event takes place in Japan. We all know how Japan is important to Cardano community - this could be a good targeted awareness project. However - I'd need to understand how much it would cost and how we can make it within the scope of this funding round.

I wish you best of luck and looking forward reading more about your work on this proposal!

Hello Daniel,

My idea was based on getting the cryptocurrency community to move over to use cardano and for cardano to gain popularity in general. I had a missunderstanding regarding the requirements of this fund challange. So my strategy is not really targeting developers, but endusers.

So I think that my proposal has a lot of potential, but maybe now it is a bit too early in the project.

I will take the time over the weekend to write a paper about my goals and the exact plan, as well as my funding strategy in detail.

Thank you for your time and efforts on this. I have few concerns though when reading through the proposal.

Here are few of these:

1\. Current fund theme is: ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""

What is 25,000 ADA requested intended for to achieve your goals?

Thank you for putting this idea together. I also share the sentiments of calendar confusion - especially for newcomers who are just joining the ecosystem.

Having said that - I'd like you to consider few questions that ran into my mind.

1\. The current fund theme is: ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"" Would you be able to guide me through your thinking how it fits within the theme?

2\. Have you thought of teaming up with existing platform providers such as pooltool.io or adapools.org to create a sub section of calendar and have you featured as the author of it? I think that would give you good exposure and experience in getting it out. I am not entirely sure this has legs on its very own. But that's just my subjective opinion.

3\. I am unsure about how the budget is going to be spent. Is it to compensate for hours spent coding on it, some hosting services? This helps to outline in the proposal.

4\. Timeline. How quickly are you able to implement it - how much time do you need?

Hopefully above questions can help you somehow going forward.

Looking forward to what you come up with.

2\. I understood there are going to be 10 episodes. Have you thought of success metrics yet? What are your deliverable goals? Namely - I am thinking - I wish to have x amount of views, engage y amount of projects to present, etc. These would help tremendously to see what your thinking is behind how you wish to get from A (now) to point B (then).

2\. Project is asking 2,500,000 ADA in funding. Yet, I am unable to determine what these funds are going to be used for. If you are able to re-work the budget to present some actionable details on spending - that would be marvellous. It will also enable you to critically look at the proposal and see if it is achievable. My gut says - given the size of the fund challenge - to create a first milestone for your project and dilute budget to first manageable chunk.

3\. Timeline is crucial - knowing when and how we get from point A to point B. Think of it as your journey planners - what things need to happen in order for your desired outcome to take place.

Thank you for sharing your idea.

While I am all for improving tech support and avoiding the scam attempts, etc. - I am not sensing any viability from this present proposal. It is asking for half a million ADA but I have no idea how to determine if this is appropriate amount or just a placeholder.

02/Oct/20 11:41 AM,323841,1787,Daniel Ribar,"Hello Miroslav,

Thank you for sharing with us your idea. Much appreciated.

Reading through it - it left me little confused towards the end. I am not sure what the end goal here is - only after putting various pieces together. May be worth articulating it a bit better.

\-------

Proposal mentions:

*""This project could promote cardano to people who work in creative industry and help them to live within cardano ecosystem""*

Would you be able to elaborate in your proposal more to see how this could be done specifically? It is rather vague at the moment.

\-------

Proposal mentions:  
*""a) how to track users who stake and set minimum amount of ADA to stake so website can make profit from staking and not from selling fees.*

*b) have some initial content such as 3D models and photographs""*

I suggest looking into each of the questions and trying to think about answers. These are important ones and if there isn't a good answer to these - there is much doubt left on the table.

\------

Sense of timeline seems to be absent. Apart from 1 year of marketing fund requests - I am unable to determine what the roadmap looks like. E.g. I plan to have website up and running in one month, then in another month I will be sourcing 3D articles to present on e-shop.

\------

What are your success metrics? Do you have goal in mind? E.g. in 3 months - I plan to have this and this done. In 6 months - I plan to have this amount of ADA staked for the platform and this and that amount of articles sold. Thinking about these helps you elevate your proposal better.

\------

Lastly, I understand total budget at the moment is 150,000 ADA. Third of it goes to the printer. However two thirds of the budget aren't providing much detail - just website and online marketing. Having website is perhaps straightforward - but I'd be interested in how or which marketing strategies are going to be implemented for the funds provided.

I wish you best of luck and looking forward! Keep up the work.

I appreciate and value the work you have done so far, and looking forward to even more content.

Personally, 750k ada looks like a huge amount to produce 24 podcasts.

Many of us might not know the costs involved in running such podcasts, this might be a perfectly reasonable amount for it's goals, but many of us have no idea. Educate us once again please :)  
At this moment I'm not voting for a 750k ada proposal without seeing more details.

Upon a business plan, showing some financial transparency by providing a 'fina*n*cial plan' seems like common sense and standard practice in my view.

  

Without financial transparency I feel it's rather likely that people won't approve the proposal.

Which would be sad, but then again, reading the comments it seems like a 'financial plan' is demanded by multiple people.

Please provide more detailed business plan and especially a financial down brake of the funding that you'r aiming for.  
Again, financial plan provision should be standard. As it is in the legacy system.

Decentralised aka tokenized ownership is a very intriguing concept. I would love to have some tokens worth of sports teams - I love NBA - could an NBA team be tokenised? That's be something, eh?

However, I suggest withdrawing this proposal so that it doesn't take up space for the actual proposals that are trying to compete for funding this round. The theme is around encouraging developer's activity and I fear this may not be in line just quite yet.

02/Oct/20 11:17 AM,323128,1667,Rob Greig,"@thewseph  Hi Matt, thanks for the comments, I'll do my best to answer. For the MVP and to gain traction the system is based around Fitbit and the algorithm is based on the users past and current performance. If they are of low fitness then the system adapts and their goals fir, likewise a high level of fitness encourages higher goals. Moving forward I want the system to open with a simple questionnaire (process flow) that will determine the persons motivation level for the day.If they are struggling mentally the system will move the focus away from fitness and into more mind healing options. This is still in the planning phase and will needs lots more research.

For the sustainable income I am planning on using a stake pool to generate regular ADA and money generated from partnership referrals will go a long way to supporting the team. I have thought about a higher level subscription model but don;t think this will take off until the system is more established.

It may be possible to get a grant or other forms of funding like the Catalyst Project - I am open to ideas. Currently I am self funding.",NO
02/Oct/20 11:16 AM,323341,1714,Gilian Geschiere,"I would love to see The Cardano Effect grow to the next level and I think it's definitely worth investing in. The proposal just needs some more refinement to sway people. I suggest you guys add more detail on how you are going to grow in those 6 months and where the funds will go to specifically. Or start with 12 episodes in 3 month periods so you can show the improvements and justify funding for another round. I would also like to know how much funding you are getting from the Foundation and possible other sources.  

$65k for a team to produce 24 episodes of an hour long is really not THAT crazy. They will improve quality, quantity and marketing of an already proven to be successful podcast they have been working on for years. That's not a bad investment. I would rather invest in that than a completely new podcast that hasn't proven anything yet. The criticism here is really good but I think they deserve a little more respect and fairness from some people here and on reddit.

This utility DAO vision starts with the CCMs as they would contribute to building it with the amazing tools at their disposal and thus it would be the worlds first Decentralized Utility governed by a DAO built for the blockchain. At the core is the notion of having an interoperable global internetwork for Blockchains so that the network is optimized for blockchains decentralized architecture, this need is becoming more and more apparent everyday as this is in essence a mission critical component of decentralization. Thus, the DAOs founding and primary mission would be to transparently show ownership and contracts making up this decentralized network in real time, so the DAO can endeavor to ensure the network architecture is dedicated and in turn incentivized to always growing to be more decentralized LoL This idea is a result of the Project Catalyst process and we feel grateful for the opportunity to be apart of This awesome community, so it is as much the CCMs idea as anybody's and In turn we are the conduit to sharing that output =vision, we are here to give back and not to waste recourses.

With Regards to our Fund2 proposal its focus is to deploy OuroborusOverRina (OoverR) in Japan initially and to share metrics with the CCMs openly and transparently but we are very confident you will be pleasantly surprised with the KPIs and to do this at Cost as the first step towards the DAO - (any clientoverRINA can Eventually be tested)

I love this concept and want to see more projects like it in the crypto space. Thanks for submitting. I'm a healthcare professional dedicated to Lifestyle Medicine, and want to get a bit nit-picky on this for a moment.

To me, the next disruptive Wellness app will capitalize on the evidence-based research of Self-Determination Theory. The TL/DR version of that is - lifestyle changes are most sustainable when the person decides what change to make and what approach to take, based on what is most important to them. Granting the user more autonomy to be the ""expert of their life"" will (from my professional opinion) lead to more effective health outcomes.

Of course, FitBit, MyFitnessPal, Calm, Headspace, and other apps are utilizing evidence-based techniques for healthy lifestyle (food journaling, monitoring physical activity level, mindfulness, etc.). However, they all start with the fallacy that the user should take the approach they've designed because it's evidence based. None of them start from the point of view of guiding the user to decide what is most important to them and what approach to take.

That leads me to ask - to what degree is the user in the seat of control around their decisions for new habits in the FOX Rewards experience? How are you leveraging evidence-based practices for the user journey?

A secondary question: There will need to be some sustainable income generating element to the app. How will FOX Rewards cover the ADA rewards allocated to users.",NO

02/Oct/20 5:48 AM,322195,1445,Jennifer,"James, I absolutely love this excerpt from the starter kit example on your website:  
  
""Many of us know how to read, but not everyone is an author. In the same way, I believe that if decentralization and empowerment are our goals, we should support as many people as possible to be able to read, and even make meaningful changes, to smart contract code. I want Starter Kits to serve, at minimum, as a place for people to gain deeper literacy on how that code works. I believe that, even if you don't want to be a developer, we will all benefit as more people can read, understand, and interact with the software we rely on in our daily lives.""  
  
You are speaking to a deeply fundamental shift that needs to happen across all blockchains if adoption and scale are going to take off. Too often an incredibly bright person is left out of the development process because they don't know how to code. Could be a scientist, a farmer, an inventor, a chef... someone who could meaningfully frame how blockchain can successfully be used within their industry. We need these people as advocates and co-creators, too, because they are the ones who open the window onto their community and its unique economy.  
  
Plus, they know how to tap their communities for financial support to keep a project moving and growing–and developers need to be paid. Yes, one way to expand a dev community is to train new developers, but another is to drive demand for developer services through tools that allow non-developer types to ideate a project and put out requests to have it built. Increase demand and you may just see devs from other blockchains migrating over to where the new action is.  
  
So, I really like this proposal if this is the ultimate goal. However, it is, then it seems your starter kits should be focused on tools that help non-developers engage in the ideation, design & production of a Cardano project, vs. Github & Marlowe training? Would be super interesting to see how you aligned budgets and metrics around such an approach.  
  
Thank you for poking me in the brain with such a refreshing viewpoint. I personally hope you continue to push the proposal in the direction of educating non-devs. Based on your site, your collaborators and social connections, I think this is in keeping with what you already do so well.. and that will give you more momentum.

  

Some final thoughts:

  
:  
Can you share some details on what metrics you will use to measure success and why they are the best metrics (also examples of poor metrics and why you think they are so) ?

: :  
Can you share a budget breakdown as to how the money will be used and how you will fund in months 3-6?

: : :  
Would you have examples of previous edu materials you've created?

: : : :  
Curious what your core messaging would be about Cardano to non-developers? How would you quickly describe why it's such a game-changer for small business owners, or scientific entrepreneurs, or agtech businesses, etc. In fact, it would be interesting to hear what you view are the most important industries to educate about Cardano in order to move closer to widespread adoption.

\--WTIM is a marketing platform that helps them complete more of this work with advertising dollars. WTIM is not competing with these programs or take funds from them. WTIM is creating the same kind of value as those programs with money the business was going to spend on advertising, not social work.  
  
""I am having trouble understanding the economic or other non-financial (social) incentives businesses have by sponsoring a social good campaign on your platform versus their own internal processes they already have full teams (Social Impact/Grants Teams) devoted to this exact task.""  
\--Again that is great in they have CSR divisions in their company, those are the kinds of business that would probably like to get social impact ROI from their advertising spend.  
  
""In addition, most businesses already do grants/social good campaigns where they use a % of their revenue streams for philanthropic works and they manage the entire process in-house (or via private/public partnerships with established Non-profits).""

I didn't mean to do this, but sometimes simplify clarifies my own thoughts and showing by example is easier than explaining.

Please feel free to use/copy as you see fit.

**Problem**: Artists and Curators receive inconsistent income and fail to capture sustainable value in a multi-billion industry they fuel.  
  

**Solution**: Contribute toward the creation of a robust visual Arts market with flexible ownership and resale royalties, as a foundation for the efficient financing of cultural production.  
  

**Detailed plan**

Indonesia's visual art investment market is valued upwards of USD 10M and continues to grow. Globally the market is much larger. Like many artists and curators worldwide, Indonesian the artists and curators receive inconsistent income. In general, they struggle financially. Due to the administrative complexity of maintaining collective interests in artworks, the art investment market relies heavily on possession of the physical work. This deprives artists, curators, and \*fans\* to share in the value upside they co-create. Blockchain technology changes this dilemma and enables new economic opportunities for producers or cultural production worldwide. Bridging the gap between the current business-as-usual and a better model we envisage, however, is no small feat.  
  

Our proposal will kickstart a new arts investment market in Indonesia using Cardano to legally maintain and administer detailed property rights over visual artworks. Encoding property rights for visual artwork that enables resale royalties and makes art investment accessible to a broader global market.  
  

Our proposal will test a market hypothesis, focused around promoting a Cardano-based blockchain arts investment market to high net-worth individuals. Art collectors and investors are entrepreneurs, business owners, business representatives, government officials, government leader(s), actors/actress. These individuals are influential. If involved, they will be strong advocates in promoting a new art market structure if they see an individual or public investment opportunity. As high net-worth influential individuals, they are also able to invest in expanding the technology development.  
  

Our plan has five main themes.  
  

1\. Work-out a base set property rights for visual artworks and ensure the format has a legal interpretation.

2\. Commission new artworks to be the first exemplars of the new art market opportunity.

3\. Represent the artworks as Custom Tokens on Cardano, legally binding the property-rights to tokens and enforcing resale royalty accounting rules using Plutus smart-contracts.

4\. Promote the sale of these artworks and the Cardano Art Market opportunity through existing art industry channels and events such as ArtJog & Bali.

5\. Run an Art Auction to sell the original commissioned artwork, establishing an initial market value for the artwork.  
  

\--

I'll stop there. Not to suggest this is better in an objective way. Fill in the details with the material after with reduced costs, risk, KPIs with what you've already got. Add the full plan in the attached document.  
  
The hard work is in 1., and where I think you have a real advantage is in point 2., 4. and 5. Point 3. Won't be that hard because so much of what you need is already baked into Cardano especially after Goguen era release add customer tokens and smart-contract support. Point 4. is the main offer you're making to the Cardano community, to promote Cardano throughout the Art industry.  
  

You may also want to prototype an art investment exchange. This will round out the proposal and help visualise the income and investment opportunity to art collectors. Caveats, this is outside of your current team skills and also will require legal work— you're turning art into financial instrument rather than a straight asset. Hence, you'll have to deal with Securities, KYC and AML regulations. At least you'll have to have an answer to that (and a bit more I suspect) before the auction",NO

02/Oct/20 4:27 AM,322961,1638,Robert O'Brien,"@tefera  sure. Most of the writing and framing of SSI is around integrating identity silos, specifically government and commercial interests. This is more to do with a market opportunity of technology vendors than and particular limitation of the motivating ideas and technology. I personally would prefer to ignore that space and go bottom-up because getting the governance of data e.g. Trust frameworks right will rightly take a long time when governments get involved.

Grass-roots trust-frameworks would be much better aligned IMHO. The verified credentials can carry lower value (wrt. government agencies) identity claims just as easily as they can carry high-value ones like ""I'm a citizen of Kenya."" This is where countries in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific have an advantage. The social bonds that define identity in these societies (or indigenous societies generally) are different (communal) than ones imposed by the Westphalian notions of sovereignty and individual identity of citizens. Encoding what Māori call whakapapa for example- rudimentarily embodied in rituals like the pepeha https://pepeha.nz/ (I'm Māori btw).

The problem is market understanding, funding and therefore resources to bootstrap adoption.

My view is things like Chamas (savings pools), impact investing in education and developing community currencies like https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/ are viable routes to bootstrap this. But in most cases, the digital identity/SSI is not considered in projects. Too hard I guess. NGOs (incl tribal organisations) can help do that, and I know a few of the UN sub-organisations have been doing work with SSI.",NO

01/Oct/20 11:17 PM,323977,1817,Robert O'Brien,"@tevosaks  Yes I noted ""In the proposal, I emphasize the first step to research the tech stack"" but that does not come across as 'researching Cardano features' that would benefit the design of a new ERP stack.

""I have been a believer in the UTXO, but that would require huge rework for some businesses."" Not at all. It is an implementation detail that a customer business won't care about. If however, it resulted in simpler business process configurations/customisation (e.g. low setup cost), better data analytics, and greater interoperation into a supply chain... then they would care. But as far as the bookkeeping & reporting of the GL is concerned they are only interested in their PnL and Balance Sheets.  
  
Anyway, Xero (Bookkeeping) uses an event sourcing model, and Microsoft Axia (Mid-Market ERP) and IBM SAFR use REA. Both event sourcing and REA are process models that map directly onto the UTXO model really well.  
  
""Might be wrong here, because when I think about smart contracts I think about fees making the transaction.""  
  

On a public blockchain sure there are fees, and that is reasonable if you're trying to coordinate with strangers. With business partners, you can look at using Hydra in the future to significantly reduce fees/increase speed. Or establish a permissioned network, or privately you don't need to pay fees on a private instance. Copy-n-pasting from my comments in pointed at above:  
  
To illustrate a particular feature of Cardano that makes this plausible. No enterprise will want to run their accounting activities on a public blockchain. However, the technically named hard-fork combinator lets Cardano run many different blockchains as if they were one, e.g. Bryon and Shelly co-exist! **That also means private, permissioned and public Cardano blockchains could co-exist seamlessly.** The hard-fork combinator provides an operating system like an abstraction to consensus layers. **The same DApp or Smart-Contract will work regardless of network deployment.** That drives code reuse and simplifies deployment. In the case of accounting, it would be possible for a completely private Cardano instance (Cardano-as-a-Service via SPO!) to execute accounting rules, e.g. UTXO input combinations, and Smart-Contracts, that are private to an enterprise. With cross-chain coordination/swaps/settlement, it also becomes seamless to interact with others via permissioned or public chains.  
  
A blockchain is a bookkeeping system, and a UTXO one like Cardano is very flexible. The proposal as drafted gives me the sense you're going to reinvent the wheel. Regardless Can you work on improving the Problem and Solution statements to reflect the research aspect of your proposal?  
  
For example:  
  

**Problem**: ERP Systems are inflexible and costly to maintain preventing robotic process automation in mid-sized companies.

**Solution**: A DApp ERP ecosystem of business automation tools that leverage the Cardano architecture and build on the ecosystem.  
**Detailed pla**n: In this proposal, we will be researching how to leverage Cardano...

It should be a set as a long term research item otherwise cardano will remain as a research project forever and never become mainstream. And also we do not know which protocol will succeed in the followup of TCP/IP. There is QUIC from google as well. I am not a networking guru, but did not have time to dive deep into RINA yet.

I reviewed the flow diagrams you created but am still confused. In consulting when we are tasked to make flow diagrams we usually try to add some structure to help guide folks taking a look (swimlanes, chronological ordering, reference/legend), you may want to consider adding some of those to help readers understand this.

What are the incentives that would drive any organization or business to back a WTIM campaign instead of using the current grants/established processes for social goods/philanthropic works? I am having trouble understanding the economic or other non-financial (social) incentives businesses have by sponsoring a social good campaign on your platform versus their own internal processes they already have full teams (Social Impact/Grants Teams) devoted to this exact task. In addition most businesses already do grants/social good campaigns where they use a % of their revenue streams for philanthropic works and they manage the entire process in-house (or via private/public partnerships with established Non-profits). This has a dual benefit (taxes, corporate social responsibility image) and is already well practiced around the globe today. Why would an organization switch from their current practice to WTIM? If you could walk me through that and how incentives align for the businesses that would be awesome.

You have been building WTIM for the past few years you have said, can you describe to us how your system works currently? Again from reviewing your documents/website it's not clear why this solution actually needs Cardano at all? If you already have a process for this I would just like to learn more about how you analyze the current (as-is) operating model compared to your future state (to-be) model on Cardano. In consulting these are the types of analyses we undergo to better understand where the real value of your application lies (as well as the real pain points/risks).

Can we talk about lessons learned from the beta campaign you sold? What company bought this (even though you say it failed) and can we go through what led up to the organization and what there specific incentive was to buy this 10k ""beta"" campaign? This is what I mean by how are the businesses incentives to sponsor these campaigns in my above question.

My final questions relate to the actual fund2 challenge:

1\. My apologies if I am missing something but it's not clear from your documentation how the WTIM solution helps attract new developers to \*build dApps on Cardano\* (and from my questions above not sure about businesses either) and increase the platform's utility.

2\. How does this dApp help Cardano (ADA) holders around the globe? I understand you are targeting businesses (even though your incentive alignment is unclear to me) but as the ADA holder how does WTIM benefit my stake at all?

Some people may do both like you suggested but I suspect that most people don't understand DeFi well enough to play both sides (even if it is a basic concept).

I saw that you guys have decreased what you guys are asking for but I can tell you from experience that the sentiment hasn't changed. It wasn't enough of a decrease.  

Most other podcasts are asking for 1/3 of what you guys are asking for. Perhaps you guys can compromise with the community and ask only for what you need for the next month or two. Then you can ask for more once the pot is bigger. Being that 20% of the $250k goes to voters, you guys are asking for 32% of the funds available.

01/Oct/20 6:37 PM,322338,1517,Liqwid Labs,"@shapiro21  Every single dApp built on top of Cardano that accepts ADA (and allows users to withdraw deposits \*at any time\*), will have the exact same feature by definition of ADA being Cardano's base native asset. Also everyone in the Liqwid pool 100% will not do be able to do this (most will have their qADA locked in Layer3 applications earning fixed income). The on-demand ability to enter and leave is the entire point of short-term funding money market protocols. It's why money markets form the base of borrow/lending in traditional finance today: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market

Supply and demand changes auto-update the Liqwid ADA pools interest/earn rates. For each transaction that affects the Liqwid ADA pool (ADA in/out) a new rate is algorithmically calculated based on the current supply/demand levels.

Nothing happens to my outstanding loan in your scenario, the interest (borrow) rate simply goes up, the pool has less ADA supply now. What you are failing to consider in your scenario is the same higher interest rate is now going to incentivize \*a lot\* of ADA holders who want the higher earn rate (the borrowers interest minus fees/tx costs) which is of course all thanks to you and Greg emptying the pool. Of course this is a very simple example and we expect significantly more ADA to fill the Liqwid pool and a percentage of the minted qADA to power long-term, fixed income investments inside of the Cardano DeFi sector.

Following macro economic theory on supply and demand and using algo-optimized smart contracts to adjust the cost of money based on current pool economics (supply/demand) is all you need to balance it out, incentives for ADA holders to earn high interest rates takes care of the rest :slightly_smiling_face:",NO

For example: If Greg and I each deposit 10,000 ADA into the liqwiid ADA pool at the beginning of an epoch and then you put up 10,000 ADA as collateral to borrow 7,500 ADA, what happens if Greg and I withdraw our 10,000 ADA each in its entirety towards the end of the epoch while your loan is still outstanding? Does it not matter since we can take from your collateral? If so, then after Greg and I cash out, there will only be 2,500 ADA left as collateral for your outstanding 7,500 ADA loan.

01/Oct/20 6:05 PM,322338,1517,Liqwid Labs,"@shapiro21  Hey great question: Snapshots take place every epoch, Ouroboros does not care what a user (stake pool owner/operator or delegator) does with their ADA in between epoch snapshots as long as the balance is in the wallet by the time of next snapshot.

Your ADA balance in the Liqwid pool is representing by qADA, you can redeem for your underlying ADA \*at any time you want, on-demand\*. That's why it's a dual strategy for ADA holders since (both staking + accruing interest) and it's on-demand for both the depositing and the redeem of underlying ADA so in your scenario the user would just remove it before the next snapshot back into the original wallet.

Keep in mind the Liqwid protocol will service several Cardano native assets including stablecoins. The dual strategy we speak of here only applies ADA since it is the only asset that can be staked in Cardano.",NO

They have the ability to remain fully staked while also earning interest in Liqwid's ADA pool. Liqwid is giving ADA holders direct access to \*Securely earn attractive risk-adjusted interest rates\* in a DeFi protocol while remaining 100% staked.""**

How would this work on a technical level? Would Liqwid need to be fully integrated into a cardano delegation wallet so that it sees the same ADA as both staked and in a liqwid pool?

Hello Gean!

  

Thank you for taking your time to go through the proposal and the comments section. I really do appreciate your interest and effort.

  

In regards towards your input, as mentioned in the last paragraph of my comment above, I am very much limited on my knowledge of blockchain and what it can do. When proposing this idea, I wasn't aware of the choice ""seeking a blockchain developer"". I did already though made an inquiry on whether Robert below is interested to collab.

Hello Robert!

Thank you soo much for taking your time to share your critique, insights and solutions in such detail. I love your feedback, it definitely open my eyes to my short-comings. I'll definitely distill my proposal further to encompass your keynotes. While I work on that, I'll try to address your critiques (please do reply to my answers if needed reply to) :

  

*1\. Aside from using a token for sale, I don't see how this addresses the challenge at all.*

Our intention is by showing proof-of-concept that tokenization is a reality and works by using Goguen which will be communicated through these high-profile art events. The artwork creation is a vessel for Goguen, while the events -where the artwork will be unveiled- act as medium to communicate with collectors of art. The collector of arts are entrepreneurs, business owners, business representatives, government officials, government leader(s), actors, actress and VIP's. Our goal is, to expose Cardano's capabilities through the financial success of Goguen by art tokenization to affluent / influential / top management people who are decision makers. By doing this top-down approach, our intentions are that the implementation of Cardano will become quicker, efficient and financially beneficial.

  

*2\. I understand you're from an art marketing background and that shows through in the proposal. Hence the emphasis is placed on communication to artists/investors in the art market through various promotional campaigns. There is no effort/focus on developers and entrepreneurs*.

As mentioned in my reply of point 1, by showing the concept of tokenization actually works, a concept that now has financial values, we believe the economic factor will induce more ideas. In fact in the proposal we offer a minimum of 3 (three) sharing session of Goguen by Cardano almost in each event. These events have huge outreach and not limited to only art enthusiast, one of these events has an attendance of 180K+. Through this with proper marketing and branding, blockchain will not be known limited only to transparency and good will applications but a real-life high value business that can be built upon. That we believe is the best marketing.

  

*3\. If you're treating artists as entrepreneurs then that is good, but the proposal does not indicate that.*

Indeed I am, I'll work on my wordings. Our main mission is to empower financially artist and curators through Goguen's tokenization capability to have percentage of ownership of the artwork they created/curated.

  

*4\. I see nothing in your proposal that addresses the specific problem you've identified ""financially struggling due to inconsistent income in a multi-million industry they created.""*

As mentioned in my reply of point 3, our thinking was as such, ""Studio's get continuous royalties from their films, if negotiated properly, even actors get royalties. So why not artist and curators?"" Through the concept of tokenization, it should answer the question above and on top of that it also democratize ownership of artwork. All walks in life have a chance to be involved in owning high-value artworks just like high-value stocks. By democratizing ownership, we believe it creates a more robust economic model.

  

*5\. Nor is this addressed ""Tokenizing art to create diverse and inclusive ownership"". In the proposal there is a hint that each artwork is represented by the forging of a custom asset with one hundred fungible tokens assisted at forging ""40 (artist): 40 (Cardano): 10 (curator): 10 (proposer)"" to represent shares in the artwork. However rereading the proposal I suspect you're not aiming at doing this, instead, you're just proposing to do a split (in a paper contract) and settling the proceeds post-sale at auction.*

Again, it's my wording and my lack of proper blockchain knowledge. Indeed it is as you mention.

  

*6\. There is also some vague mention of developing ""the auction system that encompasses Cardano's Goguen technology and ADA payment"" but extremely light on details or rational.*

Yes this is actually our knowledge level of this technology, still very light. When creating this proposal, initially I didn't see the option of ""seeking a blockchain developer"" where the reality is we do seek collaboration.

  

*7\. Also things like ""All ownerships are dictated by the binding legal contract between Cardano and Proposer"" don't make sense (as a professional, not a layperson).*

What I am trying to say is, the artworks ownership will be determined by the agreement between Cardano and our team, which legally will be represented by me as the Proposer. Because we want to ensure artist and curators have their fair share of the artworks ownership.

  

***Solution:*** *""Tokenize art to create diverse ownership, capture resale royalties for artists and enable concept funding.""*

I love this Robert. I will blatantly and without shame copy it.

  

*Because you have the local market knowledge and reach, in your proposal I would put a lot more focus on working out how to represent diverse ownership (as meta-data in the custom token forging) to represent shares in the artwork. Interfacing that digital representation to legal forms supported by your laws and leveraging your artist/gallery connections to prototype the ownership model with physical art.*

*That may be your intent, but it is not coming through in the proposal. Instead in my reading, it is focused on doing an art auction, using the gimmick of blockchains to try and help increase the market value of four artworks.*

This makes me sad actually it sounded like this. The paragraph prior to the one directly above is my intent. Though some of your input, such as *""Interfacing that digital representation to legal forms supported by your laws…""* will take time for me to process the meaning.

  

**With that said Robert, as I mentioned, we do seek collaboration with (a) blockchain developer(s). Personally I like your vibe; you're upfront, detailed, meticulous and systematic. If you would like to collaborate with us, please do inform me.**

Appreciate your reply. The feedback system makes sense but the problem of the first 1,000 users is not solved this way. I have to trust someone in the first place if he sells for the first time as a new user.

I think we should start with defining what exactly a user is. Do you mean developers, investors or people using dApps?

ADA ARMY- How decentralized can a RINA network physical layer be? If all these beautiful decentralized protocols like #Cardano& amazing Dapps like #Singularity go onto a centralized network controlled by big tech and GOVT…..many in the networking ops space think about this irony daily

ADA TRADERS- over time basically a DAO that governs a physical layer needs to be built and contracted with various providers for wired technology and low-earth orbit (LEO) comms sats for example, this is why bitcoin now has a full node on a sat connecting Venezuela infra to the blockchain

ADA ARMY- yes i have heard #TheHosk talk about this in one of his AMAs in the end RINAoverOuroborus needs to be a fully functioning DAO and build out a global interoperable haven for all chains to shelter from Centralized forces

I have no clear vision of what features we should use to leverage this ERP platform. The goal of this proposal is to figure out the first tools and features that can demo customers on how their problems will be solved.

All the Cardano features right now are the second layer of tools that we could use once we get customers and problems to solve.

Going into your example, is this ERP platform going to use Marlowe?  
As for starting, I think not. Might be wrong here, because when I think about smart contracts I think about fees making the transaction. I don't want fees to be taken every time someone requests a data package from their own server or server we provide.  
When we go to the future, definitely something to be used when the platform starts joining different businesses.  
Customer needs to drive the direction of what problems they want to solve and then we can think what features we use to solve that problem

First -- thank you for investing the time to read and provide feedback. It's clear that you really dove in, and I appreciate that.

I definitely see where you're going with the vision. I think it's possible, but I feel a lot less sure about going all the way up to the top with it. I feel like it would really need a lot of testing and studying. It's just an extremely massive power structure, and humans are complicated.

\> situations where one dev owns an open source project then leaves, throwing the whole project and all of its dependents into chaos.

Yes! This is exactly our long-term vision. The ability to have the assets under the control of the contract itself will help facilitate the transfer of power where and when necessary. It also makes it possible to define an unbreakable set of rules about how to set power transfers into motion.

\> Eventually, as this solution scales, you begin building in the features to extend this to be the platform for automated governance of any set of rules: not just code bases but organization constitutions, contracts, etc.

Yes, this is also the way we see it. I think that corporations is probably as big as we're thinking right now. I'm open to further discussion and being sold on the nation story though :)

\> I want to someday build a democratically-run company

So do I! And that's why we're here. I wanted to start right away and run Torus *on Torus*, My partner was wise to advise me that maybe that's a little too much chaos to throw ourselves into right away. So it may be a while before this company is democratic, but it is absolutely my dream, desire, and goal.

Thanks for the kind words, Adam! Please let me know if you have any questions/ideas for this. It's all hard to conceptualize since we don't have Goguen to play with, so thinking about how the game state might look is all just theory-crafting right now.

A very legitimate concern in design are the size of the smart contracts. If each action costs kB's of data, it'll be expensive to play and could be a turn off.

01/Oct/20 6:45 AM,323632,1751,Alex Leung,"I'm really shocked to see this proposal, as I've had a similar DApp idea for a very long time. I think this idea could be much bigger than you realize.

Someday, imagine that the governments of the world operate using direct or liquid democracy where people vote on updates to a set of rules, where these rules live as code in a repository. The legal language is precise so that it's machine enforceable. If you remember Hoskinson talking about asking a computer if something is legal rather than having a contradictory set of arbitrarily complex rules like today's American legal system, this is what I have in mind. Having your government defined as code would mean you could automate many government functions, such as rules for tax collection, automated budget allocation, rules on how to use census data for redistricting, minimum age requirements, etc. For example: imagine there's a repository which defines a nation's standard format for contact info. There's a vote for updating a repo which will add a new type of contact information for all citizens. The tools I use go retrieve this standard to decrypt this information when I give them my consent, and now I don't need to go update my address in 1000 different tools when I move to a new city.

My idea has been that one would start by building a decentralized GitHub alternative, marketed to the Open Source community as a way to solve the problems such as lack of funding of projects and having a customizable governance layer so you no longer have situations where one dev owns an open source project then leaves, throwing the whole project and all of its dependents into chaos. Eventually, as this solution scales, you begin building in the features to extend this to be the platform for automated governance of any set of rules: not just code bases but organization constitutions, contracts, etc.

I believe a platform like this will need to exist someday, and I'm curious if this kind of a vision is something you see for Torus or if it's not quite aligned

Personally I want to someday build a democratically-run company which has its own currency, and this company would require a platform such as this to exist. As you mention in your GitHub repo: Authoritarianism in the workplace is a 20th-century relic

01/Oct/20 6:41 AM,323866,1793,Robert O'Brien,"@yantirta  this is a long and detailed proposal that amounts to creating four artworks, binding them to non-fungible tokens on the Cardano network, then marketing them prior to sale at auction.  
  

Can you distil your proposal down, cut it back a lot for Ideascale. Still keep the full proposal as a document attachment, but just cut the rest back down to make it readable. Too much effort is required to make sense of your proposal.  

  

Specific criticism targeted at fund#2's challenge.  

  

1\. Aside from using a token for sale, I don't see how this addresses the challenge at all.

2\. I understand you're from an art marketing background and that shows through in the proposal. Hence the emphasis is placed on communication to artists/investors in the art market through various promotional campaigns. There is no effort/focus on developers and entrepreneurs.

3\. If you're treating artists as entrepreneurs then that is good, but the proposal does not indicate that.

4\. I see nothing in your proposal that addresses the specific problem you've identified ""financially struggling due to inconsistent income in a multi-million industry they created.""

5\. Nor is this addressed ""Tokenizing art to create diverse and inclusive ownership"". In the proposal there is a hint that each artwork is represented by the forging of a custom asset with one hundred fungible tokens assisted at forging ""40 (artist): 40 (Cardano): 10 (curator): 10 (proposer)"" to represent shares in the artwork. However rereading the proposal I suspect you're not aiming at doing this, instead, you're just proposing to do a split (in a paper contract) and settling the proceeds post-sale at auction.

6\. There is also some vague mention of developing ""the auction system that encompasses Cardano's Goguen technology and ADA payment"" but extremely light on details or rational.

7\. Also things like ""All ownerships are dictated by the binding legal contract between Cardano and Proposer"" don't make sense (as a professional, not a layperson).  
  

The problem statement is fine, but I would improve the solution statement.

**Solution**: ""Tokenize art to create diverse ownership, capture resale royalties for artists and enable concept funding.""

Because you have the local market knowledge and reach, in your proposal I would put a lot more focus on working out how to represent diverse ownership (as meta-data in the custom token forging) to represent shares in the artwork. Interfacing that digital representation to legal forms supported by your laws and leveraging your artist/gallery connections to prototype the ownership model with physical art.  

  

That may be your intent, but it is not coming through in the proposal. Instead in my reading, it is focused on doing an art auction, using the gimmick of blockchains to try and help increase the market value of four artworks.",NO

コメントありがとうございます！提案は編集できないのですが、編集可能になったら改善します:bow:‍♂️

■7,000ADA：背後の理由はいくつかあります。

・日本という限定されたサービスであること。他の提案の一部のポッドキャストなどは5以上の言語の翻訳作業を予定していますので、客観的に考えて、それらの提案よりも低い提案額が妥当です。

・小さく初めて、フィードバックを得ながら拡大したほうがよいと思うこと。

・これらの実行のための最大の制約は、それに日本コミュニティがどれだけミートアップやチャットで議論に協力してくれるかです、お金をかければ実行可能性が高まる…というものでもないと考えています（これに協力したメンバーにインセンティブを出すことも検討しましたが、日本に限定してそのような仕組みを提案するのは公平ではないように思いました…また同様の仕組みはCatalystのアドバイザー制度で今後実装されると信じています）

■投票方法：これに関してもちろん、完全な方法は現状ないので、最もベターな方法で計測しようと考えています。

ADAホルダー1,300人のオープンチャットを用意しています、このチャットは日本以外からのアクセスはできず、電話番号を複数所有していない場合は重複してアクセスできません。日本人はかなりの高い確率でこの基礎となる無料で使えるアプリLINEを持っています。（日本版テレグラムにようなものです。）

そこで、投票に参加したかどうかのアンケートをとり、YESとNOの比率を確認します…もちろん、チャットにいないメンバーはそもそも集計から除外されています。十分な余裕をもって、このチャットで投票を行う旨と参加を呼びかけます。

■返金保証の送金先は、「Treasury」です。（誤解を避けるため、以下です。）

■PDFへのフォーマットは視覚化として、良いアイデアかもしれませんが、正直なところ、英語ユーザーにとっては逆に面倒に感じるかもしれません…日本語ユーザーは、英語の提案本文はGoogleの力を頼って理解しているメンバーはいますが、英語のPDFの添付資料やDiscordはほとんど読めてない印象です。しかし、取り組んでみたいと思います！

■英語ユーザーと日本語ユーザーとのギャップ

私が解決したい問題もそこにあります。私が特にここで行いたいのは、英語コミュニティの提案を積極的に取りにいき、分析し、日本コミュニティに意見を公表する、そして、逆にそこでのフィードバックを、提案者に返す、アクティブなアドバイザーが「数名」出てくることを奨励することです。

日本ホルダーの大半に、英語の資料や動画を読むことを奨励することはかなり困難です。その架け橋になるアドバイザーといったプロが数名出てくることは、そこまで困難でもなく低いコストで達成できるように思え、何人かその熱意を持っていそうに思える人もいらっしゃるように見えています。さらにその種のアドバイザーの活動は、翻訳アンバサダとして財団から助成してもらえる可能性もあり、一度そのような人物が出てくれば持続可能です。",NO

Recording a chat about Cardano is different than learning the Plutus & Marlowe Playgrounds, creating lessons(building something), and then doing the lessons. And then post-production.

If you were to hire a Haskell DEV it will cost you about $70 an hour for someone that knows something, and finding a DEV that can also teach is something else. Also, a Frontend DEV is not cheap for a skilled one but can be found for less than a Haskell DEV. ADA MakerSpace hosts are a Haskell DEV and Frontend DEV and Serial Entrepreneur.

Each live episode is 1 hour recorded time. More time is spent before and after. So two dev splitting $850 an episode is $425 each. If each hosts spends 5 hours preparing, recording, and promoting an episode that is a pretty fair price.

Stake pool rewards are distributed automatically by network =, so it would be not possible for the game to re-distribute stake based on performance in a game.

Players should still be able to stake their wallet to a stake pool and use the same wallet to pay for smart-contract transactions to play the game. You can already send/receive ADA in a wallet that's already staked, so staking is an adjacent function to transactions. I am not seeing the benefit in tying the two together.

I also red your comment on the Scientific-Publishing Platform and I relay appreciate your input on the subject. Indeed my proposal so far lacks many things and one of those is clarity so I'll try to address your very good pints.

1) One of the aims of the platform is to better the scientific discourse and one way to do this is to invite more people to the dialogue. One feature I'd like to see is for the readers to be able to rate and comment the articles they read. This will not directly prevent bad actors from p-hacking their values but it will strongly discourage dishonesty. Also one of today's problems is that confirmation studies are not encouraged and scientific work that did not produced the desired outcome are not talked about. Both confirmation studies and bad results have value for scientific communications. Our platform could make it worth it to discuss about mistakes that don't have to be repeated.

2) I certainly don't suggest putting up a paywall where there doesn't have to be one. We'll have to figure out a way to cover the network costs for publications that wish to have free access.

3) Indeed there is no team so far behind the project and Haskell developers are not very common. Personally I've worked as a developer in Ruby on Rails and Python and I've only recently started to learn Haskell. I'm pretty far from coding smart contracts.

The budget I proposed should cover what I consider to be fair pay for a team of 2 developers for about 6 months.

Lets say I buy your game with ADA. You propose an option within game to stake ADA within the game's connection to its respective stakepool. Based on the operation of the stakepool, the game will divide and distribute the rewards accordingly to each player's quest success.

In Malawi, the total number of Covid-19 cases has been 5770 out of a population of 18.14 million people and 179 people have died.. so 3% of 0.03% or under 0.001% in Malawi have died from the virus (less than 1 out of 100,000 people in a place where 35 out of 100,000 die from automobile accidents). There are other health concerns that are much more dangerous, but they aren't new so they don't receive the same amount of media coverage.

I know my plans lack concrete details.. It's mostly because I want the people I'm going to be working with to have more of a say in the direction. A good monthly salary over there is about 300,000 kwacha, or $400 (poorer people often make a 10th of that). One of my friends over there is an electrician and another went to school for community development, they're both interested in learning programming.. I'm hoping to hire them and a few others on, and to start teaching them with a mob programming approach where everyone takes turns at the keyboard while the others direct them in what to do. It provides time for each person to actually experience working on code, while getting pointers from others about how to make progress, and also requires less machines.. Some money may need to go to machines other than the couple laptops and half-a-dozen raspberry pi's I have.. Shipping some of my library to Africa.. Getting a good meeting place and establishing a reliable power setup are also important.

In some of my personal research I study programming language design and how it relates to developer culture and developer experience which involves discerning the distinctive features of different languages and comparing them to each other.. many people in Africa don't have laptops, but just do everything with their smart phones, so looking for ways to make that viable for working on distributed applications is something I'm interested in getting involved with.

The first few months would mostly be an experimentation phase where I'd work together with a small group and figure out a good strategy for efficiently getting people to competency in functional programming.

30/Sep/20 7:07 PM,322338,1517,Liqwid Labs,"@greg.pendlebury  Responses to each of your points in bold.

Thanks for the details. When I meant pitch deck I was specifically meaning one that demonstrates what Cardano brings to the DEFI space in terms of economics, but I think you kind of answered it when you said ""we can use them as current case studies to analyze""… so this is still 'down the track' I guess.

""*What Cardano brings to the DeFi space in terms of economics?*"" **I am not sure what you mean here but I will answer generally:**

**DeFi or decentralized finance is literally just rebuilding current banking/financial services on blockchains.**

**Cardano (like any other public blockchain with smart contracts) becomes an ideal place to build these solutions since anyone with a wallet can provide liquidity to financial protocols with pre-defined terms and conditions that are executed onchain when certain conditions are reached. This is no different than the way financial contracts in web2 CeFi operate today. I am not sure why our team would need to create an entire pitchdeck just for this, potentially a blogpost at some point in the future but again, DeFi already exists on several non-Ethereum smart contract chains. Even IOHK/Emurgo are producing DeFi products (Oracle Pools, stablecoins) it's arguable crypto's first real sector with direct product market fit.**

When you mention these products (and the teams behind them): ""Atala Prism, Oracle Pools, ERC20 Converter""… they of course are announced, but not yet on the market. Do you have contractual partnerships with the companies? Or are you just kicking off a project to get ready for their emergence? It was \[EDIT: not\] clear to me when you were using their company logos in the pitch if they were part of the team behind the pitch (seemed unlikely), sub-contracting… or just 'present in the ecosystem'.

**All the products you mention above are open source software Liqwid aims to use in our protocol when they are delivered to mainnet. Yes our team has had initial conversations with IOHK Enterprise team on integrating Prism as the base of identity for our dApp. Yes we have discussed early timelines for the ERC20 Converter. No we don't have a contractual partnership with IOHK or Emurgo at this time. You can see our development and integration partners clearly on the first attachment and Executive Summary. Liqwid integration partner Credmark is also already in active discussions with IOHK to implement their credit product into Prism.**

I confess you lost me with this…""You would send your wrapped BTC to the Liqwid wrapped BTC market and lock a % as collateral if you wanted to take out a loan. Following your example you would next purchase ADA using your wrapped BTC on any Cardano decentralized exchange (dex) with a wrapped BTC – ADA market."" I thought Liqwid was a lending platform so I could use my wrapped BTC as collateral to then borrow ADA… which I could stake. Did I misunderstand something critical there? Why am I locking the BTC in liqwid at all?

**Liqwid is a lending market but you are missing the concept of Liqwid markets being completely distinct from each other. There is an ADA pool \*completely independent\* of the Liqwid wrapped BTC pool. They are totally separate smart contract pools Liqwid users are engaged with, completely different utilization rates, supply/demand levels, and market volume. Your example is trying to conflate them all, that's not how the protocol is currently designed.**

""our protocol introduces onchain identity"" => Don't you mean it depends on on-chain identity… unless you are pitching to deliver Atala prism itself… or are you intending to not allow people to use (for example) a government issued Atala identity?

**Atala Prism is built for Cardano dApps to use as the base of identity. Our protocol is introducing onchain identity into the borrow/lend markets. You can't point to a single other DeFi protocol existing today that does this, that would mean we are by definition introducing it but this is a syntax point, sure. ""A government issued Atala identity"" not sure at all what you mean by this. Atala is a digital ID solution built on top of Cardano by IOHK. Any user creating an Atala ID using a \*government issued valid ID\* but this does not seem to be the case you are speaking to. Please clarify.**

Aside from that last point, my question about mortgages and bonds was that they are traditionally low yield financing… at least where I live, fairly below 5% APY. So what would incentive people to loan into those instruments when nearly every DEFI pathway built on top of Cardano has to compete with ""Do a DEFI thing"" > ""Get ADA"" > ""Earn 5% APY""? All the traditional markets you mention (at least in the developed world… maybe that is my mistake) will struggle to compete with staking rewards. e.g. My mortgage is 3%, AUD bonds I hold are ~1%… I really don't know on insurance, but it is also a more speculative instrument.

**Correct they are low-yield just like the most liquid markets in the U.S. are low-yield. You are ignoring the security and low-risk attractiveness that comes with insurance-backed low yield financial products in mature economies around the world today. You are also confusing a fixed 5% APY with a variable rate that will fluctuate up and down. Nothing is static, that is the entire point of using algo-optimized money robots, rates are constantly updates to produce the most efficient cost of money/earn rate based on current supply/demand.**

**The institutions/pensions funds who are currently earning ~0% yield on sovereign debt are a perfect example of groups who will (and already have) begun deploying their assets to low-risk, low-yield insurance backed DeFi products. Entire mortgage, insurance, auto-loan markets, etc. are built on this model in traditional CeFi economies, DeFi will be no different. Important takeaways your scenario is failing to consider: the risk-free rate for staking will be the benchmark for every interest accruing protocol in Cardano but for ADA holders they can do \*both at the same time\* meaning earn a fixed insurance backed 5% on a mortgage while also staking.**

**Also you are using your subjective experience as a retail investor earning 5% compared to Cardano's early staking % which will certainly decrease compared to SME's, institutions and funds that have not even allocated to crypto yet but will when insurance-backed credit, data and financial products are launched.**",NO

Security and risk management are the most critical components of our solution, it's why we have partnered with the very best in Fintech/blockchain to implement Liqwid on Cardano.**

**ADA holders benefit more than any other user in Liqwid. They** **have the ability to remain fully staked while also earning interest in Liqwid's ADA pool. Liqwid is giving ADA holders direct access to \*Securely earn attractive risk-adjusted interest rates\* in a DeFi protocol while remaining 100% staked. Non-custodial dual interest strategies to earn ADA on top of the \*risk-free\* staking rate will come in waves to ADA holders. Our team has already had discussions with the VacuumLabs blockchain team and they are in early development of Cardano's Uniswap. Of course these protocol's carry very different risk profiles but the main point is DeFi protocols that offer dual returns for ADA holders (staking + liquidity provider) are coming to Cardano \*soon\*.**

**Liqwid aims to be the most trusted and secure DeFi borrow platform on Cardano. Our open API's allow entire Layer 3 applications to be quickly built and deployed on top of Liqwid generated data (onchain credit/data/insurance markets). This is how you incentivize developers to build awesome experiences \*that could never have existed in the web2 CeFi model\*. This is what Liqwid in the next 5-6 months will enable for Cardano developers.**

**""A great product is a good product with 10,000 iterations""**

**Liqwid is at iteration 10 currently, the entire point of partnering with proven blockchain development teams is to efficiently get us to iteration 10,000. Our core development team and dev partners are completely aligned with Liqwid's fund2 goals and development tasks.**

Thanks for the detailed replies. A couple of topics I was really trying to tease out, on how they fit in with the proposal. I was looking for timeframes on Oracles on Cardano… not Ergo. Whether they are known or not, how have you factored them into the proposal, other than ""they are coming""? What milestone will you pass where their absence will start hurting? Maybe the gantt chart unpacks that.

**You inquired on Oracle Pools, I explained to you the feature is already live on Ergo and is being implemented on Cardano. You are asking for a timeframe of delivery on something our team has no control of. I also explained very clearly there are several other options for price feeds, some our team is already implementing in Marlowe for a current hackathon. Yes you can look at our proposal and pick out specific features in our design not implemented (ERC20 Converter, Oracle Pools, MAL, Plutus transaction metadata) all not implemented yet. Does this mean they won't be in the next 5-6 months? Clearly it does not rather it means the development teams at IOHK/Emurgo are working heads down to deliver Goguen this year. If by milestones you mean explore alternate price feeds routes in Marlowe playground we are already doing that, a I highlighted in my initial response for our MVP hackathon submission. The absence of oracle pools has literally 0 impact on this project's ability to deliver Liqwid. Tweag, Appinventiv and our core dev team is very experienced in implemented dApps that utilize price feeds. This is also a well-researched field and there are several live examples powering Ethereum dApps today, none are oracle pools.**

""the protocol pays liquidators to secure the system from underwater loans"" => I think this was part of the missing information. Perhaps I missed it. I couldn't find anything like this in the proposal other than they are ""profit incentivised"" (I paraphrase). It is part of what I was unpacking when I pipped the comment on ""This completely mitigates Liqwid default risk""… because fundamentally we just shift risk somewhere else to try and minimise it. What underlying reserve does the protocol draw on to pay them? Presumably it is building up reserve buffers skimmed from fees and margins?

**This is directly covered in the liquidate call section of the Whitepaper. The shift of risk in the protocol functions so that it incentivizes (pays) liquidators for risk mitigation of underwater loans. This is the entire point of securing the Liqwid protocol from default risk even before the price drops. This is where that line came from and I used analogy on how Cardano's Ouroboros protocol does the exact same thing to incentivize network security and honest block production.**

**The protocol is paying the liquidator the collateral + any interest accrued on those locked assets, not coming from the protocol reserves. Yes our protocol has reserves from fees generated and these are voted on by governance holders for specific protocol actions that need to be incentivized.**

""Any liquidator can earn a profit by taking the underlying asset they purchased (at a discount) and immediately selling it on any dex or cex for a stablecoin."" => Thank-you for correcting me. You answer to the previous question is starting to shine more light on the idea. You have probably noticed I am trying to follow the breadcrumbs on these incentives to find where the risk lies. It seems it lies inside the liquidity buffers of the protocol itself, with the theory being that they are 'load sharing' the risk for every participant?

**Yes I totally understand. Incentives form the base of \*every\* well-functioning markets. Show me the incentives and I will show you the outcomes. Liqwid pools are Cardano-based borrow/lend markets this rule applies to Liqwid like any other market. Risk lies in the loan defaulting, that risk is mitigated by incentivizing traders/arbitrageurs who want to earn profit by purchasing the underwater collateral \*at a discount\*. This is how incentives align to secure the system from default risk. The other risk are smart contract risk. We partnered with Tweag specifically for their proven abilities to use lightweight formal verification methods to fully audit and validate the entire suite of Liqwid contract functions.**

**An entire blog subseries on Risk Management is being written now in tandem with the protocol architecture and design finalization. The risk of default is directly tied to liquidation incentives we have explained in our Whitepaper.**

""You are assuming that the APY will be lower than staking when this simply is not true"" => I wasn't assuming, I was asking you to unpack why it would be higher than staking? your formula has a 1.3% starting point, plus a utility value… so I don't understand how your first handful of investors would expect to make more profit lending than they can staking. What does an empty (or near empty) pool look like with regards to utility value? I am happy to be 'wrong'… I am asking because I don't know.

**As I explained before this is a function of supply and demand that is algorithmically adjusted each transaction that affects the Liqwid pools balance ratios (collateral outstanding, asset supply). The entire paragraph for users reading:**

**Governance processes will determine future updates to the demand curve which is represented as a function of utilization Ua. Borrowing interest rates will vary by Liqwid market and will also be updated via governance mechanisms as required in future.**

**Borrowing Interest Ratea = 1.3% + Ua \* 10%**

**The earn rate paid to lenders is baked into the loan coasts for borrowers:**

**Lender Earn Rate = Borrowing Interest Ratea \* Ua**

**By definition we explain 1.3% is a starting point (in line with equivalent interest rate formula's for other DeFi borrow/lend protocols) that will be updated via protocol governance. Also keen readers who understand how Cardano staking epoch's work have already realized; Liqwid users will not need to make the decision to either stake or earn interest, they can do both at the same time with complete control over their ADA at all times. It's not about right and wrong this is actually a selling point for all ADA holders our team should probably highlight more:**

**If you hold ADA, Liqwid allows you to securely earn additional interest (safest risk-adjusted returns above the risk-free staking) and AT THE SAME TIME \*remain 100% staked\* as a delegator, stake pool shop operator/owner. We purposely left this out of our Whitepaper because our protocol is servicing a target group far beyond ADA holders, even if the fact we are building on Cardano provides added benefits to ADA holders like earning dual stake + interest on their ADA, we simply did not think the Whitepaper was the place to go into deep detail on this. We focused on the protocol design, architecture and functional user experience for the Whitepaper.**

**You bring up fantastic questions, I am in the process of setting up both a Medium and a YouTube-based podcast series for Liqwid and I will certainly field a lot of your questions during early episodes (in addition to all of the series our team is already working on with development partners).**

""its best to let Fintech experts run the simulations"" => I kind of feel like several of your answers (but especially the last ones) fob-off the provision of answers and you have said numerous times ""we'll sort this out""… but you just put in a proposal for Treasury funds. Shouldn't there be some research that backs up ""This will really work on Cardano"" that doesn't rely on pointing to someone else's DEFI project and saying ""It worked for them"". Why can't these fintech experts answer questions before they get handed money?

**You are asking me to define a scenario we have 0 real world data on for a feature we are not even implementing in Liqwid Protocol v1. Instead of speculate on a future we have precisely 0 data on I say it's best to let the industry experts run complete analysis on this topic. In your own responses you admit you do not fully understand how some of these concepts function. That is okay and I am all about having an open discussion but you are now saying having secured Fintech/DeFi blockchain experts to de-risk and validate the high level protocol architecture unpacked in our Whitepaper \*v1\* before beginning development cycles is not appropriate because we are requesting Treasury funds \*to do the exact tasks you are requesting with a qualified team of experts\*.**

**Our development partners Tweag and Appinventiv have not yet started the design stage, the entire point of fund2 is to produce final Solution Design documentation and formal technical specs entering the development stage.

I am sure things will get better as time goes on if nothing is done.. but how much better? I have a little less optimism then you although I completely believe every SPO should have come into this expecting not to make money for at least a year or so. Your right that we don't know how many stake pools there will eventually shake out to be. Maybe 1000+ isn't a good number but there are a lot of people that know more then you or I about what that number is and they are definitely talking about the amount of pools we currently have as proof that things are going in the correct direction. if k is close to the number of pools that IOG might consider are sustainable, then someone was way off on there predicted amount of pools... like close to 87% off...

Whether the community wants to help me help small SPO's or not, it's going to shake out one way or the other. Cardano is going to be standing next year at this time. The question is, are the pools going to be dominated by the already large pools just creating additional pools or will it have more of a variety of pools? We will see...",NO

You have provided me with necessary motivation to better elucidate the vision and of course to follow through with execution, which is my intention whether funded here or not.

We do differ in terms of our vision: I do not want to see a world where we are using the potential of Cardano to create new island tax havens for businesses. If that happens, I will consider Cardano a failed endeavor even I happen to make a few dollars on the little I hold. But again - this is democracy, and I encourage you to develop that idea and allow this community to decide.

I also encourage you to consider multiple timeframes for projects here. I agree that not all proposals are great - but this is precisely the point. We are doing the hard work of creating alternatives to economic and power structures that are not working. Impatience is an enemy of this work. You're exactly right that measured in dollars, my proposal will not turn a positive ROI within the first six months. My intention is to apply Catalyst funding to making our ecosystem accessible to as many people as possible (and in doing so, increasing the value of ADA). This unique form of funding allows creators and doers the time to focus on their work while also having the necessary support.

It could work for some CeFi companies, but even those tend to sell products in many jurisdictions, so they'd have to interface with credit bureaus in all those places. The other problems of course is that traditional credit bureaus have zero visibility into crypto activity. If a significant portion of someone's assets are digital, a traditional credit score only tells part of the story. Same argument could be made against Credmark of course 🙂  

Now, about identity...we ignore it completely. We give credit scores to addresses and clusters of addresses. This is what DeFi projects need. CeFi companies who KYC their customer can connect identity to addresses.

Why would this be good for Cardano? Because new projects/products could use our score to offer more flexibility and therefore be appealing to more people. E.g.,

• Variable collateral requirements

• Variable rates

• Variable liquidation grace periods

I believe it would be a nation by definition. But I'm not sure if an Uninhabited piece of physical land could be a country by definition, but from what I've read: yes it seems it would be a country as well .

  

The purpose of a physical nation is that it allows a physical business to have residency, which in turn will allow the country to become a tax haven, should the community wish that.

  

I'm confident that making a tax haven (if legally possible) would attract a significant amount of businesses to join Cardano. A magnitude more than content creation or any other idea I've seen in fund2 so far.

All of my thinking about widespread adoption of Cardano keeps bringing me back to the idea that *alongside* all global efforts toward that goal, we should also commit some amount of resources to cracking the code on local efforts as well.

To reiterate: this proposal should not be seen as *competing with* all the essential development work, global outreach, state-level policy making that must happen in order for Cardano to succeed. It simply proposes that we should also investigate the local community-based approach to solving a last-mile problem. We have >99% of the population still to reach. We have town councils and city halls where leaders are not yet capable of imagining what Cardano's operating system can do.

I acknowledge that the initial scope of this project is limited, but the entire point is to establish the sort of strong ties to Cardano that will create network effects over time. Compare this to your idea of starting an island nation: your idea would reach a high number of people with great initial fanfare, but each of those connections would be of limited durability. This project proposes to ensure the highest possible quality of those connections on a much smaller scale, providing both a strong foundation for continued growth, and documented ""best practices"" for similar work in other communities.

I would like to be able to commit to this work full time, and come what may, believe very specifically that the Catalyst process is currently the best place to refine this plan, fund this work, and provide a support and accountability network to help with follow-through.

The suggested blockchain system might have merit for selling market research reports, maybe patents, but it is a poor market fit for academic publishing. I wrote down a few points of critique that I had for the proposal

1\. The problem statement seemed disconnected from the suggested solution. To describe your problem statement, you cite one extremely well-known article that has extraordinarily little to do with the problem of academic publishing. The second source is a known YouTuber describing the idea from the article. The article mostly discusses poor study design and misinterpretation of p-value in the medical literature. Setting aside the click-bite title of the article or the published criticism \[https://biostats.bepress.com/jhubiostat/paper135/; doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0040028 \] the proposal does not attempt to explain how a blockchain-based publishing system will solve the misuse of the statistic.

2\. Academic publishing currently moves to open access, realizing that open collaboration is the best way forward. In some disciplines such as mathematics and, to a lesser extent ML, arXiv.org becomes a primary publishing platform. I can not see how creating a paywall system for academic research will help anything. Even if this paywall benefits the authors, it will still severely limit access to knowledge and slow down the progress by reducing the collaboration and flow of information.

3\. The suggested road map starting with ""Finding a team of 2 developers"" does not inspire confidence.

In conclusion, the proposed system where content creators could sell access code to their content via the blockchain app does have merit if the right market fit is found. The best fit for such a solution that I can think of is market research or as you pointed out yourself ""philosophical essays, novels, music, theater""",NO

Most important, devs need incentive to divert attention. Some devs may be seeking opportunity, some seeking secure work, some seeking to learn, some seeking to teach, some seeking purpose, etc.

I think the first step is to segment developer prospects into profiles, and then move to understand/define value propositions relevant/applicable to each. Might also be worth listing out dev-specific backgrounds for targeting - ERC20 converter would be low hanging fruit. What languages would make for an easier transition to Haskell? What languages / professional audiences would make for a simple transition to Marlowe?

And if so, why a physical one and not a digital/online country first? And is this a 'real' idea or an idea out of protest regarding podcasts and media creators on youtube?

Why I ask these questions is;

One: I always believed that geographic regions are just being borrowed by their current inhabitants. I don't believe in the current system of land ownership. Instead I believe in contracts that give people/businesses the right to live in or use a region for a specific purpose and period of time. I think starting a nation online as a 'test-nation' gives more room to build this nation and discover the fundamental ideology carried by the citizens/businesses. I wonder how the community thinks about this topic?

And two: About the video's/blogs. Everyone has his/her talents. Social media is a part of the current culture. I don't mind people investing time and energy in it but I do wish the community would choose only decentralized platforms to share their content instead of the centralized ones.

However the comment section of that proposal seems to be closed so I'll comment here for now and perhapes @enchstyle  could join in.

The way I see it intellect is nature's most expensive endeavor and real scientific work is expensive. The problem with the current publishing system is that it makes scientific work way more expensive slow and wasteful than it has to be. However to have all scientific publications on an open platform is to deny that intellectual property has any value and it would therefore make it unsustainable for one to have purely an intellectual professional activity.

Since the current publishing system is highly restrictive there should be a great deal of unrealized potential - people who's value lies mostly in their intellect. Our community should solve that problem by giveing everyone the opportunity to thrive based on their intellectual work in a merit - based way.

Not all scientific papers can be free and open sourced. However since most research is already payed for by various state bodies or universities, some publications will necessary be free and open source since once the expenses for the research are covered the interest is mostly in communicating the results and increase visibility. The decision weather or not to give free public access to a particular work should be made only by the authors or the institution that bares the cost of the research.

Also we shouldn't forget that a publisher is a communication platform and scientific publications are just one form of communication. There are also philosophical essays, novels, music, theater, and many other forms of communication that require a great deal of expensive intellectual work. World's best Publisher should also include those.

Who decided fund2 could only give $250k.

Who concluded that fund2 needs to attempt to attract entrepreneurs and businesses.

These are arbitrary conclusions that are not fixed. Someone in power made the rule, so someone in power could allocate more money to this project if the community wanted it.

But I'm confident this idea would attract significantly more business than a bunch of youtube and podcast creators all fighting for the same small niche of people.

If the goal of the nation is to attract business then If possible I think the foundations of the nation would revolve around tax havens. So I think the first months would have to be focussed on legal. Trying to emulate The British Virgin Islands for example.

\- For example, we could say; Your business must meet certain qualifications like it must use ADApay, AtalaPrism and/or AtalaScan in order to be eligible for our 0% tax. Or it must pay it's workers in ADA etc.

  

If the goal was publicity and marketing then things like a summit there, a music festival, beautiful looking buildings etc.

It all depends on the goal.",NO

The problem statement is super general because the product goal is to create value by saving time to achieve the better or the same result.

  

The challenge is to encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano.  
I think it does focus on the challenge and on a massive scale.  
The goal is to have a goto platform where entrepreneurs can get their data problems solved.  
Developers have a place where they don't have to create the same tools over and over again because mainly it's created for open-source usage.  
In addition, it widens the target audience when there will be more things able to configure on the platform without no programming required.

  

You mentioned there is an open-source free ERP platform.  
Could you link any of them?

I checked out your suggestion https://www.netsuite.com/portal/home.shtml  
And it is not free. Every basic NetSuite user pays $99 per month.

  

You are right about competition from spreadsheets and easier things.  
But we are not here to replace any. I even imagine this platform having tools of auto importing excels and auto outputting excels to so that users get some things automated without actually having to leave their favorite excels.  
Our goal is to have all the tools in one place, but it's up to the customers what they want to use from the platform and what they do somewhere else.

We build on what customers want, so if the accounting is no problem for them, we don't build that either.  
I know businesses that use legacy accounting systems and loose hours of workers' time because the systems are not being improved.

  

A pretty large loose scope with an ambitious timeline.  
Yes, this project never has an end. However, we can start by building 1 solution after another.  
I strongly believe open-source ERP will be the next pivotal change in the world and especially when its coupled with blockchain technology.  
I am not here to say this is the right way to build such a decentralized system, but this is how I would start.

Cardano will benefit from the transaction recorded on the blockchain. There will definitely be a lot of off-chain activity, but when companies start to send transactions to each other. This is where this platform starts generating value for ADA price. If by 10x Cardano you meant the price itself.",NO
30/Sep/20 10:25 AM,324144,1844,Juan Sebastian Echeverry,"Yes, I love the idea of a sovereign internet country like The Good Country (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohJEPWLfeOk) or Wirtland (http://www.wirtland.com/).

I also think this is a good test for the Voltaire era. Can we use it to form a liquid democracy or participative democracy in this digital country?

And yes, for marketing purposes it's a great idea. I know a lot of people who have zero interest in crypto but I'm sure they would buy ADA just to become a citizen of this digital/global sovereign country.

But… this is definitely a long term project and not something we can do in 6 months. Maybe we can refine the idea and cut it into smaller pieces / user stories / milestones. Something useful/meaningful/valuable that can be done in this time period. This way not all the funds need to be allocated to just one project and we can have more focus on the first tasks needed to build our own country.

We measure the traffic and we know how many people visit the Journal and which articles are the most popular ones. A single article has approximately 300-500 readers. It is a good number if you consider that the majority of the articles are created by us and we propagate them via our Twitter. Notice that we use links to the Cardanians web. It means that Journal readers do not read the articles via our web and they do not probably follow Cardanians Twitter. The obvious goal is to increase traffic by attracting new authors.

It is difficult to predict how many authors will be attracted by the reward scheme program and whether their articles will attract new readers. If authors wanted to be rewarded they can become Cardano ambassadors. On the other hand, not everyone who would like to write articles wants to become the ambassador. Moreover, some authors might not like the idea to write articles regularly to be rewarded from CF funds. Some might want to write high-quality articles that take a few months of studying. CF funding has a structure that does not support this type of author.

Anyway, doubling the number of middle-quality articles and doubling the traffic within 4 months would be considered a success. It can be the case that we have underestimated the time needed for achieving that. Another influencing factor is the market itself. Generally, fewer people are interested in cryptocurrencies during the bear market and there are fewer readers.

It can happen that not many new authors will be attracted for various reasons. Maybe just due to the fact that there are not many of them in the crypto or they pay attention to other projects. In this case, we can reconsider the plan and try to hire a few people that would do the job full time. It would require higher funding.

Regarding attracting new authors, we just want to use common social media like Facebook and Twitter.

I will answer your questions and will then think on how to include it in the proposal.  
  
For the venue, the cost of $ 10,000 is for one quarter, being incompressible, we have chosen to show it for the first 6 weeks ($ 0 for the second period of 6 weeks).

Regarding the size of the venue, it's indeed pretty big at the moment but we try to anticipate a rapid increase of staff. During the first years, some space will be sub-rented to other businesses that needs our infrastructure (solid and stable internet and power supply) and our developers to launch their activities (2 projects are already interested by this cooperation model).  
On top, we have chosen this venue in a secure area considering the computer equipment that we will have.  

For the needs during Year 1, it is indeed not super clear and I made a typo mistake... It's 270 600$ :sweat_smile:  
This first year is split as follow :  
\- 6 first weeks |  
|- Pilot phase (First trimester) = 42 600$  
\- 6 following weeks |  
\- 3 trimesters = 3 x 76 000$ = 228 000$  

As a clarification, from the second semester we want to begin paying our developers with an attractive package (between 600 and 900 depending on the experience) in order to provide them with a sustainable position.  
Regarding the hardware investments, we want to smooth them out over the year in order to anticipate future needs.

Regarding the future income, we hope it huge !! More seriously, we are working on developing partnerships and projects (3 main projects are already mature). We will come back to the community as soon as we have solid figures.  
The fund we would like to request for are to help us get on the tracks and draw the attention on the structure. Most of our developers have a solid IT background and are already operational. So we will be able to continue working on their projects. In the meantime they will have time to develop their competences on the tools needed for Goguen (Haskell, Marlowe and Plutus).

30/Sep/20 8:55 AM,322338,1517,Greg Pendlebury,"@liqwid.labs  Thanks for the detailed replies. A couple of topics I was really trying to tease out, on how they fit in with the proposal. I was looking for timeframes on Oracles on **Cardano**... not Ergo. Whether they are known or not, how have you factored them into the proposal, other than ""they are coming""? What milestone will you pass where their absence will start hurting? Maybe the gantt chart unpacks that.

""the protocol pays liquidators to secure the system from underwater loans"" => I think this was part of the missing information. Perhaps I missed it. I couldn't find anything like this in the proposal other than they are ""profit incentivised"" (I paraphrase). It is part of what I was unpacking when I pipped the comment on ""This completely mitigates Liqwid default risk""... because fundamentally we just shift risk somewhere else to try and minimise it. What underlying reserve does the protocol draw on to pay them? Presumably it is building up reserve buffers skimmed from fees and margins?

""Any liquidator can earn a profit by taking the underlying asset they purchased (at a discount) and immediately selling it on any dex or cex for a stablecoin."" => Thank-you for correcting me. You answer to the previous question is starting to shine more light on the idea. You have probably noticed I am trying to follow the breadcrumbs on these incentives to find where the risk lies. It seems it lies inside the liquidity buffers of the protocol itself, with the theory being that they are 'load sharing' the risk for every participant?

""You are assuming that the APY will be lower than staking when this simply is not true"" => I wasn't assuming, I was asking you to unpack why it would be higher than staking? your formula has a 1.3% starting point, plus a utility value... so I don't understand how your first handful of investors would expect to make more profit lending than they can staking. What does an empty (or near empty) pool look like with regards to utility value? I am happy to be 'wrong'... I am asking because I don't know.

""its best to let Fintech experts run the simulations"" => I kind of feel like several of your answers (but especially the last ones) fob-off the provision of answers and you have said numerous times ""we'll sort this out""... but you just put in a proposal for Treasury funds. Shouldn't there be some research that backs up ""This will really work on Cardano"" that doesn't rely on pointing to someone else's DEFI project and saying ""It worked for them"". Why can't these fintech experts answer questions before they get handed money?",NO
30/Sep/20 8:53 AM,323986,1819,Bojan,"Hi Daniel,

With 20 years experience in the art industry I believe I've identified some key areas for improvement.

The lack of tools the participants have at their disposal to make educated decisions is what I'm trying to address.

Art can be acquired directly from an artist, authorised dealer, an auction or purchased privately from a third party. The best way to prove authenticity is to contact the artist or dealer directly. Then you need to ask the seller to provide a proof of ownership and provenance chain. Or you simply trust the seller is telling you the truth. The laborious nature of the process and complexity involved especially when it comes to international artists means most buyers settle for trusting a seller is telling the truth.

Blockchain is not the silver bullet. But when combined with image recognition proof of identity and merit it can be a powerful tool for mitigating risk.

  

Firstly a digital record/registry has to be created by verified expert users. These expert users have skin in the game and reputation that they need to uphold. By verifying and linking their identity to the signing process you have improved the security as bad players would quickly tarnish their reputation. Each artwork is then assigned a set of digital credentials that can be used in the authentication process. An option of creating a smart contract for each artwork that iterates on every change of ownership is now possible, A simple process on any smart phone would then allow a buyer to interrogate the authenticity of an asset in multiple ways. Take a photo of the artwork, match and identify, interrogate provenance, ask the seller to prove he has the ownership by signing the transaction, ask the artist/authorised dealer co-sign for additional peace of mind. Take possession of the provenance keys. The record of the transaction is then recorded on the chain for safe keeping and seamless transfer.

  

The initial phase of the build would require 5 months. This would give us a working mobile enabled application framework with a database, image recognition and payment gateway to start on boarding users. The next phase would require the integration with the blockchain. The cost and timeline is based for this initial phase as quoted by a local Fintech company. (document attached)

  

The idea is to get the product to market as quickly as possible and start picking the ""low hanging fruit"".

End users can scan a work with their smart phone, identify and take ownership of the provenance keys at this stage.

  

The global art market volume is around 40 million transactions per year. Converting just 0,1% of those transactions at a fee of ₳10 or $1 would make the app self sustainable from the get go with an estimated ROI 100% in 36 months.

Unlocking the game theoretic aspect of this asset class could see the transaction volume increase exponentially.

Further dapp feature additions to the platform such as tokenization and privacy protection would increase the monetisation options.",https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/idea/324175/32498/download

When I meant pitch deck I was specifically meaning one that demonstrates what Cardano brings to the DEFI space in terms of economics, but I think you kind of answered it when you said ""we can use them as current case studies to analyze""… so this is still 'down the track' I guess.

When you mention these products (and the teams behind them): ""Atala Prism, Oracle Pools, ERC20 Converter""… they of course are announced, but not yet on the market. Do you have contractual partnerships with the companies? Or are you just kicking off a project to get ready for their emergence? It was \[EDIT: **not**\] clear to me when you were using their company logos in the pitch if they were part of the team behind the pitch (seemed unlikely), sub-contracting… or just 'present in the ecosystem'.

I confess you lost me with this…""You would send your wrapped BTC to the Liqwid wrapped BTC market and lock a % as collateral if you wanted to take out a loan. Following your example **you would next purchase ADA using your wrapped BTC** on any Cardano decentralized exchange (dex) with a wrapped BTC – ADA market."" I thought Liqwid was a lending platform so I could use my wrapped BTC as collateral to then borrow ADA… which I could stake. Did I misunderstand something critical there? Why am I locking the BTC in liqwid at all?

""our protocol introduces onchain identity"" => Don't you mean it depends on on-chain identity… unless you are pitching to deliver Atala prism itself… or are you intending to not allow people to use (for example) a government issued Atala identity?

Aside from that last point, my question about mortgages and bonds was that they are traditionally low yield financing… at least where I live, fairly below 5% APY. So what would incentive people to loan into those instruments when nearly every DEFI pathway built on top of Cardano has to compete with ""Do a DEFI thing"" > ""Get ADA"" > ""Earn 5% APY""? All the traditional markets you mention (at least in the developed world… maybe that is my mistake) will struggle to compete with staking rewards. e.g. My mortgage is 3%, AUD bonds I hold are ~1%… I really don't know on insurance, but it is also a more speculative instrument.",NO

30/Sep/20 6:00 AM,322338,1517,Liqwid Labs,"@greg.pendlebury  Hey Greg all of my responses are in bold. Thanks for this feedback:

Section 2.1.1: ""Participants with long-term investments in ADA and other Cardano-native tokens"". I think you could significantly improve readability and logic by separating ADA from all other assets. My other comment about ADA's base tokenomics unpacks why, because I suspect they are much more complicated.

**We will take your readability comments under review. We took the IOHK technical research term for Cardano native tokens ""Native Custom Tokens"".**

Section 2.2: Ok, so I can see the need for Oracle development to handle spot prices in your liquidation mechanism… has that been unpacked anywhere? (I saw this was later glossed over in 3.5)… are you just assuming that are coming? What sort of timeframe do you expect?

**Oracle Pools are live on Ergo's EUTXO smart contract chain today. ADA and ERGO markets are already live: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/oracle-pool-state/adausd**

**They are being implemented in Cardano now. Also, our development team is already exploring \*several\* open price feed models beyond Oracle Pools (currently using Marlowe Oracle's that observe price feeds and choose yes/no action paths according to observed price feed). These is also a not finalized protocol design so I would caution against making final observations based on a protocol architecture and design that has not been finalized by our development partners. These designs will be cemented once they are completely de-risked and validated by Tweag and Appinventiv partners. The final design for Liqwid's open price feeds will retrieve a Liqwid pool asset's price from Liqwid's open price feeds.**

You also mention in the same section: ""This completely mitigates Liqwid default risk.""… this feels almost like a claim to invention of a perpetual motion machine

**Here is the entire paragraph for context on this statement for readers:**

**""If the value of a user account's outstanding loans exceeds their borrowing limit, a portion of the outstanding loan may be repaid in exchange for the user's qToken collateral (liquidation call), at the spot price minus a liquidation subsidy percentage; this incentivizes arbitrageurs and traders (collateral liquidators) to rapidly step in and repay the loan value to bring user's accounts back within borrow limits. ++*This completely mitigates Liqwid default risk.*++ Additional updates to the protocol architecture and design could enable a sub-protocol futures markets that provide frictionless links from high value Cardano-native NFT token owners (e.g. Real Estate LambaTokens) to borrowing users. This would create de facto peer-to-peer, decentralized, insurance-backed derivatives market that function to keep Liqwid money markets stabilized, and in the event of a liquidation call…""**

**This section is describing our incentivized liquidation call, it does completely mitigate default risk and it works in operation the exact same way Compound's liquidation function call operates. Also by definition the next sentences highlight that the liquidation mechanisms are not finalized and they will absolutely be the most carefully de-risked and validated protocol architecture pieces when our team begins work with Tweag + Appinventiv.**

If the borrower's collateral (say wrapped ETH) has had it's spot price plummet irreversibly (say ETH finally collapses) you are saying that lenders can trigger a liquidation call… but doesn't that just hand them a bunch of worthless junk tokens? The borrower still has their borrowed ADA somewhere else… or more likely they traded it away to do whatever business they were doing elsewhere. Whether the borrower choses to default or not here is entirely up to them… not the protocol. Or am I missing something? Is this completely relying on liquidators always being willing to gamble that the collateral asset has not completely crashed and they will scoop it up on the chance it rises later? Is there some mechanism I am missing where liquidators must do this that would justify the ""completely mitigates"" statement?

**Even before the collateral drops there would an entire group of traders/arbitrageurs reviewing the total outstanding Liqwid Protocol Loans (https://blog.baowebdev.com/2019/11/how-to-build-a-compound-liquidation-bot/) the protocol pays liquidators to secure the system from underwater loans. This was the exact point being highlighting in the paragraph above you took the sentence from.**

**It gives them those tokens \*at a discount premium\* which they can sell on any Cardano dex at spot prices or exchange for a stablecoin. Also, this process can and will be automated using Liqwid's open API's and SDK's (link above for the equivalent liquidation call in Compound finance from Nov. 2019).**

You also say ""Any Cardano user that owns the user's borrowed tokens may trigger the liquidation function call""… but it isn't clear to me if this was correlated to the statement two paragraphs before: ""If the value of a user account's outstanding loans exceeds their borrowing limit""… so can lender's only liquidate if the spot price of the collateral results in the borrower being under-collateralised?

**This is correct anyone who owns ADA can use Liqwid open API's to liquidate a percentage of underwater accounts with open loans. Not lender's anyone who wants to call the liquidation calls (or automated liquidation bots built on top such as the link above) may liquidate \*a portion\* of the underlying collateral asset at a discount.**

I might also be misreading that section because ""owns the user's borrowed tokens"" implies to me we are discussing the lender, but it occurs to me you might be referencing 3rd party holder's of that fungible token? I assume you are then referring to liquidators.

**Again for those reading here is the entire paragraph for context:**

**Any Cardano user that owns the user's borrowed tokens may trigger the liquidation function call, trading their tokens to receive the borrower's qToken collateral (plus their liquidation subsidy amount). Since the entire borrow/lend ecosystem is contained within the Liqwid Protocol (users, tokens, spot prices), liquidation function calls are a streamlined, trustless process that require precisely zero reliance on centralized systems (e.g. CeFi match lending, order-books).**

**This is not discussing lender's it is discussing liquidators (traders/arbitrageurs/bots) who want to profit from underwater loans (secures Liqwid Protocol). Anyone who owns ADA (or any other Liqwid market token) can call on Liqwid's open API's to liquidate a \*specific percentage\* of an underlying collateral asset.**

Is the margin space that liquidators play in related to the ratio of ""qTokens"" are issued against collateral? Do liquidators control this as a group to set their risk appetite and/or safety net when prices drop?

**In this scenario qTokens are representing the borrower's collateral balance which is locked in the lending pool and to answer your question no liquidators do not control any of the variables in the system. The system relies on game theory and crypto economic incentives that subsidize the process of liquidation (the same way the Cardano network incentivizes SPO's to secure the network, Liqwid incentivizes liquidators to secure the protocol from underwater loans). I am not sure what you mean by ""set their risk appetite"". Any liquidator can earn a profit by taking the underlying asset they purchased (at a discount) and immediately selling it on any dex or cex for a stablecoin.**

Section 2.3: ""Borrowing Interest Ratea = 1.3% + Ua \* 10%"" <= This was why I was mentioning separation of ADA. Why would the liquidity pool bootstrap itself up from nothing (in terms of utilisation) when the APY is significantly less than you can get from staking? I could see this working for wrapped \`CDN-20\` assets.

**Every Liqwid pool is pricing algo-calculated APY based on the pool's current supply and demand conditions. So that's your answer to the bootstrap question. Also you can stake ADA and supply to Liqwid at the same time its an instant protocol users can come and leave within single transactions. You are assuming that the APY will be lower than staking when this simply is not true, it's a function of the pools current supply and demand. If demand for ADA (users who want leverage) is outpacing supply the APY will be as high as it needs to be to attract additional demand. By design this means the rate will be higher than the risk-free rate associated with staking returns. It does not matter if its ADA or any other 'CDC-20' it is the current supply/demand calculation that sets APY.**

Sections 3.1 and 3.2: I have glossed past the actual maths. I am a developer, but not a financial person… so I am assuming that someone with a finance background will assess them.

**Our development partners are both reviewing our entire protocol design and set of variables/formulas. These will certainly be updated in the future as our protocol architecture and design are finalized. The entire point of partnering with Fintech experts like Tweag and Ethereum DeFi specialists at Appinventiv are to completely validate all of these \*before we begin development\*.**

General questions:

• I know a typical DEFI 'flash loan' is all done in a single transaction and carries a specific cost in each protocol. I might have missed it, but I couldn't see how interest rates and/or fees were discussed in a way that would let you determine how liqwid would handle this (or at least, very quick loans). e.g. If you had a large sum of wrapped BTC sitting as collatoral and took out a large ADA loan right before the Epoch boundary, made sure it was delegated across the boundary for a snapshot, then repaid the loan within a few minutes… would the interest be higher than what you would get from delegating it?

**Liqwid is not introducing flash loans in the v1 protocol. DeFi protocols implementing flash loans have been compromised several times and the current design implementations open up unnecessary protocol risk (https://quantstamp.com/blog/market-dynamics-of-the-1st-bzx-hack-part-1). After careful analysis and development with Tweag's Fintech expert team we may or may not decide to introduce this feature to Liqwid Protocol.**

• Would the above scenario possibly result in massive liquidity shortages around Epoch boundaries? and/or unpredictable loan rates caused by supply shortages for retail consumers that don't understand staking and just see crazy volatility every 5 days?

**Your assumptions around flash loans are just that, assumptions. We can't tell how the future price dynamics of ADA and the DeFi protocols built on top of Cardano will work. The entire reason for partnering with Fintech experts like Tweag is to completely analyze and jointly design protocol features such as exotic loan types like flash loans. Great question but to avoid speculation its best to let Fintech experts run the simulations, game theory models and economic modeling required to accurately conclude on the potential effects of introducing flash loans.**",NO

Thank you for the feedback . There are some good points in there . A NEW FORM OF MUSIC refers more to my vision of how music should be in the modern NEW Social Media Age in the ' Form ' it appears . It will be acoustic guitar music with singing . The aim will be to make people sing it and take part in the challenge .  
  
As far as the length of time it takes , I have spent 3 years honing recording , writing and editing so it can be a fluid process . A lot of the music and sound has already been made ( pre-production ) and the 1 day refers to only if a last minute request is made . The more time given the better . I can work to strict time deadlines which is included in the price .  
  
I am happy to ask for less , but I am sure the quality of my music will be far higher than something out of a professional recording studio which will likely cost far more when considering songwriting fees for a lower quality product , recording time , producer time , video filming time , and video editing time as well as all the mastering etc . I will do it all .

""Skilled workers spend time on tasks that technology could do for them.""

Yes, there are! Even if there weren't it isn't a problem to be solved for. SAP could be completely open-source and it won't affect their bottom-line one iota.

30/Sep/20 4:06 AM,322338,1517,Liqwid Labs,"@greg.pendlebury  Hey Greg, the pitchdeck is the 5th attachment, also added here for your ease. The entire Liqwid Protocol runs on Cardano rails, our protocol is using the best Cardano's tech stack has to offer this design uses primitives that don't even exist on other chains (Atala Prism, Oracle Pools, ERC20 Converter, Transaction metadata) or would be extremely inefficient. This is precisely why our team has partnered with the Tweag blockchain experts that constructed Cardano's smart contract layer from the ground up with the IOHK Plutus team. Our team has also already begun implementing our contract functions in Marlowe Playground for the UN x IOHK Wyo Hackathon using the JS + Haskell Editors.

I prepared this proposal with the documentation I would for a proposal my consulting firm would submit to a federal agency during project bidding. We of course do not expect everyone to read the full Whitepaper but that's why we have a Project Catalyst Executive Summary, a pitchdeck, and a fund2 specific set of slides to address the current challenge. I will also be live on the Cardano Effect Podcast this weekend to unpack Liqwid Protocol in detail and field any community questions on our proposal.

To answer your question, Proof of Stake protocols like Cosmos and Polkadot have DeFi ecosystems with PoS ~5-10% APY we can use them as current case studies to analyze. Also with the introduction of Emurgo's Oracle Pools + Emurgo/IOHK built ADA-backed stablecoins we will soon have a lot of data on how users engage with the protocols built on top of Cardano that offer them rewards at a risk level above the risk-free rate. I have also spoken with the blockchain team at VacuumLabs (AdaLite wallet) and they are already working on the Cardano Uniswap. All this would do is serve as a base ""Automated market makers"" (AMMs). These are great for liquidity provisioning since they are algorithmic agents that perform the basic market maker functions and, as a result, provide liquidity in electronic markets.

Liqwid is offering the same automated liquidity pool concepts to build peer to peer borrow/lend markets with integrated identity and credit.

The incentives for liquidity providers are tied to several things and yes at the core higher APY than the risk-free rate (staking) is expected but keep in mind our system is algorithmically updated . Also, liquidity providers are airdropped the Liqwid governance token so they are also receiving the platform's future governance rights/ cashflows \*for free\* just for providing liquidity (as a borrower or lender). Ethereum DeFi protocols work in a similar method today.

I am not sure what your second bullet point is asking. Borrower's are key user's in Liqwid and it's important to remember the protocol is driven by each Liqwid pools supply and demand that is continuously algorithmically updated to produce efficient markets in line with macro-economic theory on supply and demand, as well as time value of money.

Multi-Asset Ledger is the Cardano native DSL for forging new native assets on Cardano's blockchain. Taking your example here the with ""wrapped BTC"" on Cardano, realize that since this would just be a Cardano native asset in the Multi-Asset Ledger era a new Liqwid Pool can be formed for this asset (just like any other Cardano native asset). To answer you question no you would not be able to lockup Wrapped BTC to borrow ADA, they are totally different markets. You would send your wrapped BTC to the Liqwid wrapped BTC market and lock a % as collateral if you wanted to take out a loan. Following your example you would next purchase ADA using your wrapped BTC on any Cardano decentralized exchange (dex) with a wrapped BTC – ADA market.

• Would the staking APY likely set a floor on the interest rate? In the long-term would this mean traditionally low yield markets (like mortgages or bonds) aren't feasible on Cardano?

It actually means the exact opposite as your assumptions here, our protocol introduces onchain identity (Atala Prism) and onchain credit (Credmark integration) in a design that enables entire insurance and financial service markets to be constructed around mortgages, bonds and insurance products. We already see these sectors taking shape on top of Ethereum's DeFi sector and there is 0 notion of identity or onchain credit in those networks.

Also keeping in mind interest rates are updated based on algo-optimized calculations of supply and demand and users' credit, this is not a definitive statement you can make. There will always be liquidity providers willing to lend their assets to users who have verified their identity and their ability to repay a loan + agreed upon interest. Entire NFT Real Estate markets can be built on top of Liqwid Protocol in a very simple design by using Liqwid open API's to price mortgage/insurance products. Emerging market users around the globe will soon be using their onchain verified FICO-equivalent credit scores and Atala Prism identities to access more attractive mortgage products than the most competitive rates in most Western nations.",https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/idea/324124/32484/download

I'm sceptical of the fundamental premise ""Cardano needs Haskell/Plutus devs to grow."" Core development is well covered and the amount of Plutus coding needed for even a complex protocol will be small. The engineering is more important. That aside if Cardano did need more functional programmers then it is a lame-duck. Albeit a nice one. The vast majority of developers will interact with a Cardano node through libraries such as GraphQL or library bridges into their language and toolchain environment of choice. Functional vs Imperative makes little difference. Don't get me wrong, I think every single damn software developer out there should learn functional programming.

Hey Daniel,

Thanks for the acknowledgement and the sharp questions.

Functional distinction is the primary driver of this idea.

Funding small seeds into content startups can exist independently in a bespoke funding mechanism.

End goal: Funding content efficiently. + Allowing bigger tech buildouts to shine and compete against other tech proposals.

1\. Biggest challenge: How to effectively promote this idea WITHOUT resorting to the

""send the Why Cardano channel viewers to out-kudo other tech projects""

(the ""aha moment"" behind this idea)

Currently sketching workaround to promote it organically vs ""out-promote --> out-kudo"" method

  

2\. Execution is fairly straight-forward.

a. 4 week consultancy to establish the guild, design workflows, and establish starting standards for the content funding process.

b. Create a series of videos explaining how the guild works and how to get started

30/Sep/20 1:04 AM,323861,1792,David Kanaszka Jr.,"@daniel.ribar  Hello Daniel, thank you for your thoughtful comments and direction. As it stands now, our platform is significantly outdated. While we would like to grow our userbase much faster, we are not confident that a surge in activity would be beneficial to our users without better infrastructure in place. Non-payment of winning bids and buyouts is a growing problem, though we aim to combat this through the disincentivization mechanism listed in #2. Additionally, the use of PayPal as an intermediary for payments between users means that we have little control over a dispute between users, even if we have been given strong evidence to support a claim. With a platform built around our own payment rails, we can step in and handle these disputes at a much lower cost and more accurately than PayPal and pass that benefit along to our users. Combatting fraud on our platform becomes much easier as reliance on PayPal is reduced.

As a small addition to this, we have an issue that is persistent and costly to our users that cannot be addressed without PayPal's 'consent'. If a user mistakenly sends The Dealers Den a payment for an account credit (meant to cover seller fees) instead of the merchant that they meant to pay, the 2.9% + $0.30 fee stands with PayPal's new policies, regardless if we refund them the payment. While this may not seem like a lot, many of the sales on our platform are in the range of thousands of dollars, meaning that this could be a $50+ mistake with no recourse. A mistake like this made with payments using Cardano could be easily corrected for pennies.

#4 is the addition that we are most excited about. Being able to reliably build reputation in the community as a prominent and trustworthy seller/buyer is paramount to success as an online business. Being able to register, track, and verify authenticity and ownership of popular one-of-a-kind costumes and creative works of art only compounds this benefit.

With all that said, an exact timeline on this project is monstrously difficult at this very moment. With Plutus still going through development, it's not clear what kinds of tools we will have or how difficult it may be to actually build from a coding standpoint. We know that it is possible, but we cannot even estimate the total cost yet, we just know that in order for us to grow to the next level, this project is absolutely necessary for our platform, with or without assistance from Fund2.

We are currently, and for several months, have been in negotiation with some of the best coders in the Cardano ecosystem and we have plans to go through with this build regardless of the obstacles we face. The ADA requested would greatly assist us in overcoming the financial burden of hiring these developers and allow us to bring our product to market much more quickly, but lack of support will not deter us. We are here in the Cardano ecosystem to stay. We will be one of the many pioneers of this new tech and display clearly the power of blockchain-enabled payments and identity solutions. We believe in Cardano and the community surrounding it. Will you take a chance on us?  
  
Thank you for your time and consideration. If you have any further questions, we are happy to answer them to the best of our ability.",NO

30/Sep/20 12:31 AM,323408,1730,Robert O'Brien,"@greg.pendlebury  To add to Nick's comment above. The main challenge (problem) is helping people understand how to use the unique features of Cardano and the ecosystem (Stake Pool Operators) using a suitable motivating example. e.g. one that benefits from those features. These features are:

  

1.  The logical clock (slots) provided by Ouroboros to time-bound and time-lock protocol execution steps and termination.
2.  Extended UTXO as a realisation of CS theory concurrency models for distributed computing.
3.  Native custom Tokens and Meta-Data (representing the NFTs)
4.  Stake-Pool-Operators (running Oracle-Pool node s/w) and nodes in a distributed computing network
5.  Wallet certificates to anchor reputation and enable governance.

  

The motivating example and problem are a Smart-Market to enable **multi-lateral swaps.**

To keep the scope both approachable and manageable we're going to apply this to a fictional trading card game, think an elementary Magic the Gathering (MtG) type of thing, to explore and learn in public. In this simple example, the use-case actually contains a lot of the key features of a production deployment:

  

1.  Cards are represented as NFTs using Native Customer Tokens with provenance.
2.  MtG Players trade their deck in multi-lateral ways to optimise the game play.
3.  Since the Cardano Blockchain is also the clearinghouse, the ExUTXO transaction history enables market discovery.
4.  The Auction protocol is periodic with specific states. Therefore coordinating in space and time.
5.  The Oracle Pool model provides a nice incentive solution to the computationally hard aspects of Smart-Markets- finding efficient allocations in a complex domain.
6.  Being a member of an Oracle-Pool enhances the revenue opportunities for SPOs.

  

Since there is a lot of subtle stuff in the architecture of Cardano that is unfamiliar to people, the proposal's solution is the journey. The resulting material will inspire others to find suitable market domains (product-market-fit) by applying similar ideas. Hence a key outcome is to inspire at least one production use case of a Smart-Market+Oracle Pool.

The typical continuous market, such as a cryptocurrency exchange, optimises for profit. Smart-Markets optimise for information gathering of inter-related items.

The hard-part about Smart-Markets isn't the auction protocol etc. It is understanding the specific resource allocation problem you are trying to solve. Electricity, gas, water, transport, food banks, environmental services etc. Hence the real engineering effort for Smart-Markets is *designing and implementing efficient optimisation algorithms.* Then building a product-market-fit around it.

What we are aiming to do is construct the **framework** for building Smart Markets + Oracle Pools on Cardano such that others can apply it to a specific domain.

For example, the combination of a Smart-Market, Oracle Pool, and an Automatic Market Maker (AMM) can be used to develop a Stablecoin.

The incentive model provided by an Oracle Pool First-to-Post strategy and Data Inputs that Robert Kornacki (Emurgo Research) has developed means anyone wanting to create an open and transparent Smart-Market can because they can optimise their own implementation to the allocation algorithm to beat others- it is like a Proof-of-Useful-Work- which is a perfect way to incentivise more efficient algorithm design and implementations as market volume increases.

  

We will NOT be attempting to develop a robust efficient market for Trading Card Games. Nor attempting to go to market with one.",NO
30/Sep/20 12:17 AM,322338,1517,Greg Pendlebury,"Can I suggest that you break out a specific 'pitch deck' or document that focuses in on ""Why Cardano?""

It is certainly compelling that you've got such a detailed documentary baseline (I am still slogging through the whitepaper), but I strongly suspect most voters and reviewers will struggle to review the whole thing in detail.

To me, if one is familiar with traditional financing, and with DEFI in a generalised way on PoW protocols like Etherium… then the missing piece is ""How do the economics and tokenomics adjust when put above a PoS ecosystem with a built-in, risk free, ~5% APY?""

Examples Q's:

*   What are the incentives for liquidity providers? APY > staking but at risk?
    
*   How likely are borrowers to use borrowed funds to participate in basic tokenomic activity? Will it likely impact the ecosystem?
    
*   How will Multi-Asset Ledger impact this? So people bringing wrapped BTC to borrow ADA, as an example?
    
*   Would the staking APY likely set a floor on the interest rate? In the long-term would this mean traditionally low yield markets (like mortgages or bonds) aren't feasible on Cardano?",NO

I just added more detailed figures for the budget. (We have been asked to keep those figures until now :)

I think those elements will help you to understand how we built our budget and what we took into account.

We narrowed a bit the period until 2021 because we have a better visibility.

But we overall budget over the years will basically remain similar taking into account a progressive rise of the manpower.

As for the important amount needed over the 5 to 7 first years, we are (and will) also looking for projects and partners to support us in our development.

Regarding the evaluation of the project, for the first phase(s) of 6 weeks we will provide the Catalyst community with :

\- a detailed summary of all the costs incurred to verify our use of the funds and whether it matches the initial budget

\- a resume of the recruited developers

\- a summary of our current projects

On a longer term, we will provide the community with detailed reports on our activities showing both the use of the funds and the concrete projects implemented on the ground.

1.  About whom, the subject;
2.  About What, the specific claim;
3.  Who issued/made it.
4.  Usage rights

  

Alice has completed a degree programme for Computer Science at the University of Nairobi.

Atala Prism is based on the Self-Sovereign Identity approach to integrating \*identity\* silos. The core of the technical mechanism is a DID (Decentralised Identifiers) to name things and make it easy to resolve, or lookup, the services associated with the DID, and Verifiable Credentials.

Since the whole point of SSI is to integrate and interoperate across silos, interoperation is important. Therefore in order for the credentials to be understood you need a shared schema that describes the data in the credential. You'll need an ontology and taxonomy of subjects to completely describe the claim. Then you'll need a trust-framework that covers the mutual reliance on the issued claim and appropriate use. i.e. a multi-lateral agreement that covers the rules for issuance, use, and disputes.

You can skimp on things such as schema and trust framework if your intent is not to integrate across identity silos, or you're not attributing any value to the encoded claims. In the problem domain you're discussing - government services- neither is true.",NO

In addition, it's just great marketing.",NO
29/Sep/20 11:34 PM,322195,1445,rcmorano [PEACEpool by La RepsistancE],"@greg.pendlebury  apart from the operational cost of running servers (which would also obviously depend on service demand), I did not want to go into detail until we (community) define something concrete.  
But essentially, yes, I'm currently alone in the Dandelion journey and what I needed to launch was just a cookies-less static page I cooked myself on Github to present the idea and the free resources (that could be replaced by some markdown in an official portal), and setting up every needed service on a cluster. No too costly, but not a production-ready deploy neither, of course.

Independently of which umbrella the community service finishes hosted under (Cardano Dev Portal, Dandelion site or any other community initiative) and which form it adopts, costs that I can foresee are basically 2-3:

*   **Servers**. Currently everything runs smooth (under no load apart from LacedWhales bot, which is negligible) on non-redundant 3VCPU/4GB instances for ~$100/mo, but I'd say we'd be good starting by 2 nodes per cardano-service that ensure service availability and some computation resource slack for initial \[auto\]scaling.

  

On current provider and architecture (Kubernetes), it would be a total of 37 humble-size nodes (3VCPU/4GB) at around 10-15€ (depending on storage) each:  
\*\* 3\* monitoring nodes  
\*\* 2\* ingress-controller nodes  
\*\* 2\*8 services for mainnet. Current list: cardano-node, cardano-db-sync, cardano-explorer-api, cardano-submit-api, cardano-graphql, hasura, postgresql-ha-pgpool, postgresql-ha-postgresql.  
\*\* 2\*8 services for testnet

A total of around 600€/mo previewing extra underlying costs for the infrastructure maintenance and thinking about using the free plan from Github Actions to perform the CI/CD.  
That's around 40k ADA at current price for the 6 months of the initial PoC stage.

  

*   **Love from a team of at least a couple of (sysadmin|devops)-skilled people** (SPO profile) that can spend the time needed for catching up with new versions of the different and upcoming Cardano software pieces, performing security updates, improving infrastructure HA (High-Availability), CI (Continous Integration), monitoring, watching for its health and resilience ""24x7"" et al.

  

*   Maybe it's also a good idea to write some educational content to show how to take advantage of such a service. I found myself today learning vue.js and Electron and planning to create a boilerplate desktop app that can sign transactions with metadata from a hardware wallet; but since I'm not any expert on this, any help from **an experienced developer** would be welcome on the team.

29/Sep/20 10:50 PM,322205,1452,Julian Miralles,"@jaycidiq  hi Joshua, it's my pleasure.

I saw that you changed some of the proposal's structure and you've added each expenditure with the cost in USD. That's great! It's much more robust now! I'd like to help you to finish clarifying a few things, so you have a mini ""business plan-like"" proposal.

IMO in order for the proposal to be even more robust, you should clarify the following things:  

***""Recurring costs (6 we******e****ks) :*

***• Facility – (Rental / Maint.) : 10 000$""***

Is this rental only for the 6 weeks, or for the trimester? It seems a bit much. If it is $10.000 for a year, you should clarify this. Also, if you are asking funds only for the pilot phase, IMO you should only ask for the funds needed to cover the rental needed for this phase, not the full year.

  

***ABCD Venue***

***We have conducted prospects for finding ABCD's offices (rental) and some interesting ones have been selected.***

***Among them, one on the Woji Road, GRA Phase 2, Port Harcourt, Rivers retains our attention.***

I think if you include pictures of these places it would add a lot of value to the proposal. Also include the dimensions of the place if possible. This would show you are for real and ready for business!

  

***This place will allow a team of up to 60 people with open offices, meeting rooms, conference rooms, etc. in a secure area.***  

If you are starting with 15 developers, isn't this place with rental of $10.000 a bit too big? Maybe you could consider a smaller place?

  

***Total costs for Y1 (pilot + 3 trimesters) :370 600$***

I don't see how are you reaching to this sum. I'd say you should check this number. Just viewing it like this seems a bit much for the costs of only 1 year.

The costs in USD are great, but I think an explanation for these is missing. For example, why are the investment costs for the conference room (Display/screens, desks, chairs, etc) twice? Are you expanding it after the first six weeks? These kind of things should be explained in detail IMO.

  

One last thing, I saw you mentioned in another comment you are planning for this to become a for profit business. I think you should clarify how are you going to achieve this. For example, what will be your income on the 4 first trimesters? Where will be these income coming from?

  

Anyways, I'm just thinking out loud to try to help you. In my opinion the proposal has potential and it's exactly what the Cardano ecosystem needs. Boots on the developing world. However, a few tweaks should be made in order for it to be as realistic as possible and it doesn't ask too much financing.

It's clear the community appreciates the work you have put into TCE.

  
However, reading all the comments from the community there is a clear concern about how you estimated the costs. In the business world I live in, when you wish to get a funding, you should address all the concerns and request for detail your ""investors"" have. It is disrespectful to the investors to use excuses such as: ""We cannot disclose all the details due to competition..."" or ""we all value our work differently"". It's the Cardano's community money, our money, and community wants to know how and where will be spent. The fact that the fund2 Challenge wants to achieve transparency by putting all the ideas in public for refinement and voting is very ironic when we need to spend time discussing this topic. That's the world of free competition gentlemen!  
  
Two advices:  
1) If you've spent any time around entrepreneurs, you'll know that ideas are worth (almost) nothing. Worth comes from the time you have invested to bring your idea to life. And you guys have invested much of it with a great result. Meaning you should not be afraid of competition. So please put an end to this discussion and transparently present where and how you are going to spend those 750.000 ADA.

2) You don't know how exactly you are going to spend those 750.000 ADA? Here is an idea: Many companies when they want to hire advisors they cap the proposal into working hours. That would require during the project to claim and explain your hours spent to your investors. Warning: At the end if you claim an hour, for a task that it usually takes 15 mins, there is no way the investors would turn to you again.  
  
I hope that will help you put an end to this potential animosity in the community.

Lastly, it would be great to formulate in one or two sentences WHY you believe this is necessary for your platform and how it benefits the users. The information is rather scattered throughout and isn't easily identifiable. I could be at error here reading though.

Looking forward where this develops. Again, thank you for your contribution.

Love the logo - I could see that already happening. Very nice.

But let's zoom out of it and back into the proposal. Proposal is asking for a considerable amount. I am having trouble understanding how and why this particular value will get you from point A to point B. Then, timeline is useful to understand what's the actual scope of the efforts. Then, we'd be able to evaluate if the proposed funding amount is appropriate or unlikely so.

I have also always wondered - how does blockchain prevent fake art or art products in circulation. If 40% of it is supposedly considered as such - how do we ensure that information fed into blockchain ledger is the other 60% and not the 40% fake one? This is just my purely subjective lack of context - I'd be happy to learn, if willing to explain. I think proposal can use that for someone coming by trying to identify the problem and the proposed solution.

The problem with a chip is that it requires specialized equipment to read it and of course it needs to be implanted into the pet itself, not to mention the infrastructure and registry services to use them.

Also how likely is it that a pet will lose it's collar? I can imagine if it loses serious weight while it's lost that could easily happen, the idea here is to encourage action quickly by those that see him/her so that the pet can be rescued before things get that bad.

A familiar QR code requires much less effort on the part of the random person over calling the vet/pound, then there is the real threat of the dog not being registered and being being put down which prevents many people from even considering anything more than feeding it and wishing it luck.

I propose that a familiar QR code is a game changer in terms of getting people to act quickly and reuniting pets with their owners, it changes the equation completely by not relying on any infrastructure, legacy registry, vet, pound or other related service outside of the cardano blockchain and the website, it is purely peer to peer from the person finding the dog to the the owner with no reliance on a 3rd party or specialized equipment.

The beauty of this it can be deployed anywhere and easily used by anyone, even in places that have no pet registry services. Or say if the pet is lost outside of where the pet registry is located, say on holiday, and especially if the pet was never even register which is surprisingly common - often cost being the reason.

Of course it's not all negatives with a chip, the positive you have mentioned is quite a big one, an alternative would be to contract a 3rd party to tattoo the QR code in the ear - something to aim for in the far future if this system proves successful and is adopted.

I'll be adding further details to budgetary requirements, as well as a road map, once i figure out how to, at the moment I have only seen that solitary field.

Future funding will actually be very small, all the heavy lifting is done on the front end of the project then to keep it alive it is simply the cost of hosting the website and keeping the domain name registered, perhaps it would make more sense to include funding for the first 5 - 10 years in this initial proposal for the hosting and domain registration.",NO
29/Sep/20 7:14 PM,322205,1452,Daniel Ribar,"tHello Joshua,

I congratulate you on your efforts. This certainly is something that requires attention. I really hope this will get to see the light of day.

Nonetheless, I have few comments.

You are asking for a considerable amount of ADA just shy of 10 million by end of '22 with expected sustainability in 5 to 7 years. Which translated in need of greater funding eventually. Yet, the budget is vary vague in terms of how that may be allocated. With this kind of figure, budget generally requires equal amount of the attention as the front facing effort does.

I appreciate that you realise this is not a quick project to undergo and will take some time to complete. Have you thought about tiered release of funds based on the review periods that you have initiated to mention? I think that will give greater accountability for the project, including credibility in the long run to keep it going. This way it ensures that funds are released gradually and based on the results.

Also, curious to know, as I haven't a firm understanding of what a success story looks like. I see that you mentioned the team will determine these and even present back to Catalyst to see if it meets them - however, we should have a good grasp of these metrics holistically prior deployment of the above mentioned funds.

I couldn't find that just yet. Have you thought of how to measure the efforts when we'll be looking back in 2022 or 5 to 7 years down the line?

Talking about creating job opportunities for Africans or creating partnerships is a very noble goal but difficult to ground in real terms as it is very vague. Thinking about these more specifically will help you narrow down the focus and ensure good allocation of resources. Hence, set you up for greater success.

At any rate, I am rooting for this project - hopefully it gets the legs it needs.

In the big scheme of things 75K is not much, but in this scenario we're trying to kick start Cardano, bring in new ideas, people, ideologies etc. Taking away 30% of the fund to improve an existing product doesn't look like a good deal.

From an outsider perspective I see the following:

1) You're already being founded by the CF. If you're using out of pocket money that's something to discuss with them.

2) As ambassadors you also get incentives to create content in exchange for some form of remuneration.

3) Thanks to the TCE you guys get exposure to the public and as a consequence your pools do incredibly well.

4) If I'm correct you plan to attract many viewers, then YouTube revenues should be good :)

5) The proposal puts more weight on what you already accomplished instead of enlightening us on how success will be measured going forward and what the specific goals are.

From what I've read to many this comes across as a greedy move or cash grab. I wouldn't good that far but I would say is not in the community. I don't see a missed opportunity if we don't vote for it and there should be pretty good one.

Hi Daniel,

Great questions -- thank you for asking.

We're currently a small team volunteering our time outside of our normal working hours. We absolutely plan on delivering this vision with or without funding, but the more funding we can acquire, the more contractors we can pay to get the work done sooner. We believe that timing is a crucial factor to success right now, because there are many displaced workers around the globe due to the fallout of COVID-19 that could really benefit from this system, and we also have the opportunity to be a premier DApp on the fledging Cardano system.

If I quit my job, the requested amount will support me for 6 months, which is the duration of the Fund2 challenge. During that time, we will continue to seek additional funding to expand the product as laid out in our roadmap. The progress we make on the product in the next 6 months will give us a product to validate with paying customers. We can then show investors the proven value. It's not certain that we will be able to obtain additional funding, and at that point I would have to find a job again. That's a risk that I am taking to see this vision through.

I don't know if I was able to make it clear enough in the original post, but while we have a vision for a fully fledged governance system, we are just focusing on the first set of features to make a minimum viable product for this challenge -- the ""automated recruitment machine."" To be overly simple about it, the recruitment machine is effectively just a system for helping project owners decide when a contributor is worth paying and then helping them do that automatically out of a Cardano wallet.

Please don't hesitate to ask additional questions.

29/Sep/20 6:56 PM,323939,1804,Daniel Ribar,"Hello Franco,

As a 'dog daddy' I love the concept idea. Thank you for bringing this up to our attention.

However, I see potential limitation with using only collars. The idea behind chips is ensuring that dog is identifiable even if the collar gets lost. Is there a particular reason why this couldn't work as well? I am curious what would happen if the collar does get lost - how can blockchain help us in this scenario?

On the other hand - would you be able to expand on your budgetary requirements? I see one grand figure but not beyond allocation of these resources. It would be helpful to understand how the funds are going to be distributed.

I also have some doubts about timing. What happens to the users should not subsequent funding be secured by a chance? Also, how much time would it take to bring this live - a road map of sorts may be helpful to understand how you plan to get from A to B.

Regardless, good concept but few questions.

When I read this project, I immediately felt that users could pay for specific instructors (whether that be for fitness, meditation, etc.) and a percentage of that payment (voted on by community) could go into a stakepool. That stakepool would grow along with users, while also increasing staking rewards. Staking rewards could be dispersed between users of the app that are achieving their goals.

Maybe this was already part of the plan. But, I believe this is a great project, it just needs to be sustainable and I struggle envisioning how fitness chains will partner with the program. Enabling individual fitness instructors and therapists to freelance through the application also fits the decentralized mindset of the Cardano community.

Great marketing opportunities could be made by partnering with popular fitness group instructors that promote the application, and their class. As more users for them, means more money for the instructor, the project, and more rewards for users later down the road.",NO

I can imaging that you guys do not want to rely on the Foundation for sponsering too much, although you both are creating a marketing tool which is unbelievable great. People seems to forget easily that you must have put in a lot of hard work FOR FREE and without any revenues.

My opinion is that you should be treated the same way as IOG,EMURGO AND CF and just get some million ADA for doing this necessary work. The CF should give you 5M ADA from the CAP for doing this great work and to expand it with other Marketing tools.

Hello Daniel!

I really appreciate you taking your time to share your kind compliments and comprehensive input regarding the topic I am highlighting, it is very much welcomed. They all make sense and I feel will definitely have the effect you mentioned. Though I did notice, I had trouble editing my proposal, but let me look into it again.

With that said, you seem to already understand tokenization but to take assumption out of the equation, **tokenization of art simply put is creating a digital equivalent of that artwork- for example- in the form of a digital rectangular box which is made up of various sizes of Lego's**. Where each Lego's has a certain value which can be bought, traded and owned. You could even say tokenization is like an IPO of a certain company, where art is substituted by the word company. During an IPO, the company offers a percentage of their ownership in the form of percentage of stocks, where blockchain token is substituted by the word stock. Hope these examples can assist everyone to understand more about tokenization.

The biggest challenge I see is not the concept of tokenization, but the additional steps needed to complete the procurement of an artwork, with that step being in the form of currency conversion. Will the benefit of having the capability to purchase high-value artwork in small amounts out-weight the additional steps?

Another challenge I see is the community stance towards the government's inclination to regulate everything. For the essence of blockchain is decentralization which I believe is contradictive towards regulation. To my understanding the government of Indonesia are seeking cooperation with Indonesia's Blockchain Association to implement certain forms of regulations, whether this is a hindrance or enabler remains to be seen.

What's going to keep me up at night though, is ADA's valuation. **Curated art's value in general always goes up,** while digital currency to my understanding is still volatile. Cardano with it's proof of stake encourages people to hold onto to their ADA's. With that being said, conceptually I am seeking a solution from Goguen, how will it address the situation when current ADA value becomes lower than the ADA value during the art purchase. What system can Goguen provide to prevent the art value falling inline with ADA's potential dip.

I hope I have addressed your questions but as you noticed I too am seeking answers and there's a lot of them actually. Again, very much appreciate for taking your time to read my proposal. If you have further comments please feel free to voice them.

We considered a higher percentage than 2.5% but opted instead to make this proposal and reach for saturation.

Our thinking was to have a competitive pool for all delegators, and honestly, with a > 200,000 Ada a year potential, Cardano will make quite an impact.

Regarding our past work, almost all relevant work, past ten years, has been in request for proposals, RFP writings, and negotiating Ad contracts. Not exciting stuff to showcase. With that, we do know ads and how to get the most out of them.

We plan to bring out target markets (outside of crypto space), highlighting their reach and where Cardano could come into their world. Narrow those choices down, and have delegators vote on which market(s) to go after.

Getting the community involved at the pool-level, delegators to the pool is critical. Having delegates vote is vital. Critical as we will be touting the voting capabilities of Cardano in the ads.

N45B should never be the only driver behind the wheel; without pool-level voting, this proposal would not exist.

Great slide show - clearly - you know how to simply and effectively communicate. It's been a while a slide show took me so quickly - yet precisely through all of your talking points.

I tend to agree that dividing funding efforts into developments of code and then front end to be in separate categories. I like the idea of having themed buckets. Is that what you are trying to do - to keep both separate to allow good projects to shine through each without being overshadowed by either theme group - or whatever is hot these days?

Having said that - what are your biggest challenges with regards to making your idea happen?

Also - who would create the Creator's guild and to whom would it be accountable?

Thank you for your time - well appreciated

Commercials often mention the differences of a product and why their product is better. To tell the story well, people can often also be seen, with the result that one looks smart and the other a bit stupid. For example, Apple has often used this approach as in the ""Mac vs pc"" series. https://youtu.be/0eEG5LVXdKo

It's finding a good balance in the story to make it work properly. We plan to work with a script writer to get the voice over right.

The animated films are not directly intended as commercials, although they will of course show that Cardano is good. They are intended more as short informational films that are originally made and are fun to watch.",NO
29/Sep/20 2:44 PM,323341,1714,Daniel Ribar,"@rick.mccracken  I see, understood.

I am looking at it from the perspective of looking at two highly visible and valuable community members/contributors. You'll likely be always scrutinised more than a regular foe. I guess that's expected and unlikely to change.

My thinking is to get ahead of the commotion. Not exactly pinning down every penny to be spent - but submitting one grand value is likely an extreme in another direction which people will NOT understand. If you push the scale towards the other end - it will help people grasp the understanding.  

E.g. - for Audio - this portion is planned; for video - that portion is intended. Also, contributing information about you paying out of pocket is also valuable information to share. Otherwise - other people will do it for you and set context instead - you can control that by framing information first. Vis some comments in this thread.

At the end of the day - you are trying to push yourself to be better. I think, setting up by example what a good proposal is, we're setting up our community at large to a higher standard and for better success. If others are copying what you do - that means you are doing something worth copying in the first place. I've never been bothered myself people copying what I have been up to - it just underlines that you are competent and people are eager to watch you.

I am just worried that laxness across the board would lead to low value funding with questionable results. I see many proposals lacking this - so not picking upon yours specifically. I don't believe, or at least don't see presently, any reasonable negatives for not including semi auditable timeline, goals, benchmarks, and utilisation of budget requested. As someone looking from outside in - I have no idea what I am voting for (does that make sense?).

Mind you - running a podcast is not a new thing. World has millions of podcasts published daily - so 'protecting' something you could potentially 'google' in few moments seems counter-intuitive. Naturally, I am being simplistic.

Lastly, not everyone must be familiar with your platform. This allows you to speak to a new audience just tuning in. If I never heard of Cardano podcast and came across this proposal - I would be confused. Hence, this is a good opportunity to consider.

Ultimately, it is your call and shall respect it. This is purely my subjective view. Such assumes that you may be better off to stay ahead of the curve.

29/Sep/20 12:27 PM,322909,1632,Robert O'Brien,"Can you change the solution statement to reflect the fact you are only planning to do research into decentralised cloud computing market opportunities? I had to read through the whole detailed vision and rough market analysis to find out what this proposal was actually about.

It is fine if you're essentially asking the community for pre-seed funding but make that a lot clearer. At the very least move the TL;DR up to the top of your detailed plan, and put the vision and your identified market opportunity below that.

Since the current challenge is to attract DApp developers/entrepreneurs what licensing terms will be assigned to the resulting deliverables? In principle, and for argument sake only, I might want to take the results of your research and use it too. Will you stop me or any other member of the community?

Regarding the problem, why do I care that ""cloud"" is becoming consolidated and how is that addressing the challenge?

As a software engineer, I don't actually care about that because the infrastructure is a commodity and as long as I don't use a vendor's specific features I can easily switch. Many of my tools and practices (Containers/K8/DevOps) reinforce that. Software-Defined Storage and advanced networking within data-centres are really good so only services with high-fanout would potentially benefit from decentralised cloud i.e. a CDN, or predicative proxy of features of Netflix. Your proposed vision of a better world doesn't change that. We have a fully K8 cloud running on Pi Clusters that fully boot and configure from the network. It is a commodity all the way-down.

From Cardano's perspective, I can see that you aim to make it the billing layer for cloud services but can you expand on why Cardano? You might be aiming to use the unique features of Cardano to achieve what? And how might that benefit the challenge at hand? For example, you mention networking. Cardano includes a fresh take on the networking stack for P2P applications that decentralised storage and compute could both benefit from, but how/why?

One of the undercurrent emergent trends in software development is Serverless, and with it an increasing awareness of cloud-computing costs, an emergent practice called FinDEV. 5G architecture is also important here. A blockchain coordination layer for mobile computing (not to be confused with mobile phones) is a prospective fit, or for things like NFV but instead, you're talking about what is essentially emergent legacy ""cloud"" architecture. ie. IMHO I think the proposal needs a better vision to technology fit. Apologies if that is coming across as harsh.",NO
29/Sep/20 12:26 PM,323341,1714,Daniel Ribar,"Hello Philippe,

Thank you for putting in the work over the course of the last few months especially. I have high regards for the quality content produced so far.

Unfortunately, the proposal misses few marks for me. And hence - not surprised by some of the comments here that followed.

I would suggest to re-work the proposal with more detailed funding breakdown especially. I understand that you have a number of target episodes in mind and then one grand value. However, it doesn't tell me much how these funds are going to be allocated. Hence, breaking it down into manageable chunks will allow you also to understand better what and how you need. Otherwise, I cannot judge if the amount you are asking for is appropriate or not.

As time goes on - you will be able to determine for your future funding whether your current needs where over or under the estimate baseline budget.

Thinking aloud, you also need to establish reviewable measurable goals. Many things included are too vague to grasp an understanding for. Hence, all the confusion. To quote few from the list above:

*Live and prerecorded guest interviews* \- what is the base line engagement and how/where do you wish to get by what timeframe  

*Increase production value on video and audio platforms* \- what does that mean specifically - equipment? More professional help? How much would that cost, etc.

*Improve the website* - what improvements do you wish to make?

*Hire a dedicated, experienced Audio Engineer* - when do you plan to do it and how much would this person need to support their role

*Hire a dedicated, experienced Video Editor* \- same as above

*Increase community involvement -* what is existing community involvement and what target and how would that be achieved

*Highlighting stake pool successes -* how do you define stake pool success

You guys have a lot of great ideas. But it needs to be grounded better - add some meat onto it as there is a ton more experience between the two of you together. Am I wrong? You produce high quality content already - I am sure you can match the proposal that would play the part well. Is it incorrect for me to have high expectations then?

Lastly, I understand there is a sentiment about podcasts and etc - I believe there is a crucial place for these in our ecosystem. I don't wish to get distracted by the fact which are needed or not. I am rooting for well versed proposals regardless of which hut it comes out from.

However, being able to communicate your past, current and future engagement with the community with greater degree of transparency and effort - will ultimately make it easier for you to justify whatever you wish to bring to the table. Community cannot read your minds. Put its mind at ease pre-emptively and you'll avoid turbulences.

Looking forward to your updated proposal. I have high hopes for it.

29/Sep/20 12:05 PM,323787,1770,Daniel Ribar,"Hello Phil,

Thank you for sending this proposal. Much appreciated.

However, I have one big reservation. It asks for 500,000 ADA to get it going. Yet, it doesn't take any effort to outline how and what this amount will achieve. It is a large sum of money which deserves its own accountability.

I am afraid, not many will consider a proposal that doesn't include such information. Personally, I'd like to see a detailed roadmap of where we are now and where we wish to go. Specific timeline goals and measurable benchmarks.

Namely, if this project is given 500,000 ADA - how will we measure its effect after all is said and done. These are crucial questions that need to be addressed.

There are few others that come to my mind but for the sake of simplicity - who will receive this 500,000 ADA. Is there a governing body or who can we expect to be liable for what happens to these funds?

Thank you in advance and wishing you best of luck!

29/Sep/20 12:00 PM,323553,1744,Daniel Ribar,"Hello Yuta,

Hope all is well. Thank you for putting together the proposal. Few thoughts running through my mind as I read through it.

Do I understand correctly you are asking for 7,000 ADA in total to fulfil items outlined in this project? Do you find this number realisable? I think this seems on a low side, personally.

When you talk about KPIs - e.g. Japanese voters participate to exceed 20% - how do you determine the base line again? I see you mentioned some sort of questionnaire. But is there a better representation of baseline data and then following benchmark data? I am just not entirely on the same page with regards how to measure this effectively.

Also, you mention if the KPIs are not met - money is going to go to financial union? What is that exactly?

I would suggest to create a .pdf of sorts to re-format the above proposal. Personally, I have found it difficult to navigate it in the text format above. Could just be me.

I have also one last idea - we keep hearing about how Japanese market is important to the Cardano ecosystem. However, I see minimal effort bridging the gap between Japan and the rest of the world. From my perspective, I see a giant Japanese bubble and then the rest.

Are there any plans to rejuvenate this relationship? Creating perhaps a dual language program that would address this language gap? And thus introduce both communities together? It'd be a shame not to, I think.

Personally - I would find that even more exciting proposal to consider.

29/Sep/20 11:38 AM,323823,1776,Daniel Ribar,"Ahoj,

Few quick thoughts.

Would be worth establishing some measurable benchmarks. How do you measure if the provided funds have had desired affect when reviewing back. Will you track the traffic for the web - how much will that change over the course of funded months? Engagement rates?

Etc. If so - would be good to provide current stats (traffic, contributors, article cadence, engagement) and then establish goals for where you wish to be in a specific timeline. So that we have specific measurable goals in mind benchmarked against current status.

Other ideas to measure goals are in line with expanding timeline - ""we wish to have attracted X amount of authors/contributors during Y timeframe."" OR ""We wish to increase the cadence of articles by X per Y time frame.""

Also - how is the plan/strategy to attract new contributors/authors - what venues are you considering to make that happen?

Lastly, I agree that aiming for quality than quantity is desirable.

29/Sep/20 11:31 AM,322784,1621,Robert O'Brien,"I don't think ""enough coders on Haskell/Plutus"" is a real issue such that we need to upskill lots of people in that specific area. There is a macro concern of up-skilling: Blockchain Engineers, especially in people that come from and are empathic to socially challenged situations. The assumption being they will have a better appreciation of their market, than someone from a wealthy country/situation helicoptering in.

Writing a DApp (protocol, front-end and back-ends) won't require lots of expertise in Haskell/Plutus. A domain-specific protocol will typically be rather small in terms of lines-of-code and Marlowe is aiming at making things easier. IMHO The real challenge is in the design of the protocol. And by design I mean understanding the ecosystem need of the problem domain as much as modelling/specifying the market mechanisms or collaboration protocols. This is new territory for most. Front-end and back-end work can be done using Javascript hooking to the Cardano Wallet via GraphQL over HTTPS for example. These are well-known tools but applying to a problem/solution that is benefited a blockchain-based architecture (a DApp) is more challenging.  
  
Anyway, here is an attempt at improving the problem and solution statement. YMMV.

**Problem Statement:** Limited finance options for socially-inclusive teaching prevents delivering learning options in challenging contexts.

**Solution Statement:** A socially-inclusive digital school, training up blockchain engineers on Cardano. Sustainably resourced through an SDG alined decentralised impact finance platform.

I like the feasibility study approach to scope the idea out, except I would like to see more emphasis added on the underlying market needs of the learners. The emphasis in your plan is focused on the impact investor needs. For example, you might find by understanding these needs, rather than a digital school, and in-person training programme is more supportive. That would lead to a train-the-trainer model.

29/Sep/20 8:58 AM,322961,1638,Robert O'Brien,"The specific market opportunity for this proposal is excellent. I can 100% understand the problem. However, both the problem statement and solution need a little work to be more exact, and to narrow the scope.

You plan to use Atala Prism for the claim issuance/verification pilot, so the proposal seems to be more about market adoption of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) solution rather than encouraging Developers/Entrepreneurs to use Cardano. That in itself is an enormous undertaking given the maturity of the SSI technology ecosystem.

I have not read your research ""Distributed-Ledgers"" report, so excuse me if these comments are reflecting that. I am mostly commenting on the substance of the problem/solution/plan aspects of your proposal. Here is my stab at it, notwithstanding 140 char limit.

**Problem Statement**: ""In Kenya, citizen information is siloed across government agencies. Lack of interoperation results in poor delivery of government services to citizens.""

**Solution Statement**: ""Pilot with the Kenyan population registry a Self-Sovereign Digital Identity approach to data integration such that citizens have agency over what data is shared.""

That said, a Pilot is potentially way too early. What privacy laws are in place and how effective are they? What verifiable claims are going to be made in your pilot? Who are the counter-parties? What is the schema of the claims and how will these be mapped into the transaction meta-data. Has the Kenyan government worked on a trust-framework at all to enable these to have any meaning?

The best example of the Trust-Framework for governments at the moment is the Pan Canadian Trust Framework - https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/

These are super hard questions, especially around privacy and information sharing. There is a genuine present danger in enabling governments to integrate citizen information without the appropriate controls.

The first thoughts I had after reading your proposal was to not work with the population registration function but on company registrations. Could, for example, try ***prototyping*** with the Kenyan Companies Registry? Something like Verifiable Organisations Network https://vonx.io/ and Atala Prism. Doing this would be immensely valuable to the Cardano Ecosystem generally.

You're correct six months isn't much time to complete useful running exemplar (or even a total fund amount of $250K). We're intentionally aiming for small prototyping. A big part of the proposal is the public learning journey and the spreading that learning through videos/blog/code educational content.

The main goal is to get people thinking about the possibilities of using the unique features of Cardano: Ouroboros's logical clock, the ExUXTO process-oriented transaction model, custom tokens and meta-data features for NFTs, Plutus, interestingly combining these - a smart-market design that uses an oracle pool.

It will be an ongoing project beyond the six months. We'll potentially seek funding for future work in later rounds. See the proposal as let's get started doing something useful, achievable, that involves the community—something aligned with the broader mission of Cardano (Financial OS and Economic Identity).

The proposal is to figure out a framework for mapping a batch/periodic Combinatorial Auction based Smart-Market onto the ExUTO, Custom Tokens, and Oracle Pools. We are in no way attempting to build a real market. Such matters require solid research into the market problem and micro-structure along with the appropriate optimisation algorithms, which are market dependent.

We are going to use a very simple fictional Trading Card Game (Cards as NFT), think an elementary Magic the Gathering type of thing, to explore and learn in public. That includes pulling together related research readings, developing cadCAD simulations (thereby engaging with the Token Engineering community). Then matching smart-contract code, maybe some UI elements as clickable prototypes, and if possible noddy Oracle Pool member node software (for the Trading Card Swap market).

We're still figuring that out. But an outcome might be that we inspire at least one Smart-Market DApp.",NO

""Blockchain finance for social good - Supporting the United Nations Social Development Goals""

Our team has begun development of Liqwid's contract in Marlowe playground and our Marlowe dev is currently trying to figure out the most efficient way to produce a mint/burn transaction in Marlowe. We are using the Haskell + JS editos in Marlowe for this.

If required we will also introduce Haskell Foreign Functional Interfaces (FFI) into our Marlowe playground code. The Foreign Function Interface (FFI) allows Haskell programs to cooperate with programs written with other languages. Haskell programs can call foreign functions and foreign functions can call Haskell code.

We have begun with the mint + redeem contracts in Marlowe and we aim to use all of the static analysis/simulation tools Marlowe provides to test a broad range of scenarios. Our dev is currently conducting some early analysis to understand the impact of using FFI on the static analysis.

Update: Mint contract implemented in Marlowe playground using a ""minter"" role to replicate the derivative qToken minting upon deposit. Devs working on building the Mint contract directly using the playground source code (FFI) and then porting it into the playground. If we end up implementing and testing our entire contract suite it would be really cool to share our mint/redeem contract functions with IOHK Marlowe engineers and have them pull our contracts into the playground.

Working with Credmark integration partners to explore API integration into the Marlowe oracle role. More updates will come early next week!

Update (10/8/2020): Our devs have completed the entire set of Liqwid smart contract functions and are completing static analysis (SMT Solver) of each contract within Marlowe's playground. Our team is also putting together our slides for submission to the Wyo hackathon and have begun exploring how to more directly align the goals and missions of Liqwid with the United Nations SDG's (specifically those related to financial independence) and specific challenge goals.

In addition our team has begun exploring risk models build from data teams at IBM and various startups that would provide a more complete solution to introducing credit onchain. It is our goal (post-Hackathon) to partner with one of these firms and build a Liqwid turnkey solution to credit calculations that prices in not only a user's onchain activity (Credmark) but also data from their mobile phones (how many mobile minutes used on avg., how large their contact network is, GPS info) and their social media accounts (Similar to Social Lender).

29/Sep/20 5:06 AM,323341,1714,Red Green Blue,"Hello guys,

I've been lurking for a while under other pseudonyms watching TCE since Episode 1 and recently have begun to be more active in the community.

I think its stating the obvious when I say you guys are valuable. And with some bk of the envelope calculations 75 k for a team seems reasonable if not borderline low. I think most people's issues come from an expectation of transparency with specific estimated costs when a project is community funded which is fair. I remember Philippe's youtube video from yesterday where you spoke on transparency of spending within the U.S government. Short form- Philippe said, ""I dont mind paying taxes but you'd like **informed** choice in where your money goes."" In Cardano we have something akin to paying taxes. A rather crude way of explaining it- is when we stake our ADA on the platform through inflation (money printing) we are ""payed"". (This provides incentive to secure the network, etc, etc.) Rather than 100% of the inflation going to stakeholders a certain percent is taken off the top in the form of tax and goes to the treasury. I understand that you want to set a precedent that you can use Cardano to start a profitable and sustainable business which is what most of us also want out of the treasury. But as a taxpayer and stakeholder, I'd like there to be a precedent set that projects, devs etc. do not only request for things they need or will provide but also provide a cost breakdown at a minimum. The only real disadvantage I see from your POV is a reduction in flexibility of funds, more paperwork, etc. In my opinion the biggest advantage is you can ask for a much fairer amount that is transparent to all parties involved in the future. Because again, I think that 75k could be lower than the ""fair"" amount for a team especially when you consider income tax and Cardano's 20% tax returned to voters. There are so many other factors also like where in the U.S you're located.

A simple example of a request lacking in transparency is when you want a renovation done to your house and the workers tell you all the wonderful things they will construct/change with a net cost but deny telling you in advance how much each part of the job will cost. Or to use your example with the U.S government- why do I not know where all my taxes go and I find out after the fact (if at all) that $4,214,281,749.00 went to project X and $732,891.00 went to project Y. It's not only your project I'd like to see things be more transparent in, but you guys could really set a great precedent to follow in both profitably and transparency. You are after all in the spotlight and many look up to you and your platform for news, debates and everything Cardano. Lastly, there is no other platform in the Cardano Ecosystem with your guy's proven track record and I'm not sure how Cardano would look today without TCE. Just my two sats my friends.

Big fan and will continue to follow TCE regardless,

The same reason WHY People give 15-20X more money to nonprofits every year than business. In 2019 people gave $449 billion dollars to charities while business gave $21 billion, but spent $500+ billion on ADs. And sometimes when people gave their own money to causes they had to go through a checkout process and many setups just so they could give their own money to a cause they care about.

So why wouldn't those same people visit a Dapp when a nonprofit they follow or a friend shares a link where they can raise funding for nonprofits with just the tap of their finger and no donation required?

People are already going out of their way to raise funding for causes they care about, and WeThinkItMatters, WTIM gives them a free and rewarding way to support causes they care about, with the funding coming from brands that want to be seen by them.

WTIM is only like BAT in that WTIM's Token is purchased by advertisers.

BAT is something you only get using Brave Browser. Whereas you could take part in a WeThinkItMatters campaign using Brave Browser and get WTIM Tokens. You could take part in a WTIM campaign on any device with internet.

Also, the Brave Ads that you get BAT for are the same type of ADs that you see everywhere else, and ZERO that was spent on them by the advertiser is making a positive impact on the world. And the BAT you get is a tiny % of what the advertiser paid.

WeThinkItMatters is a whole new KIND of advertising platform that is designed to be a nonprofit fundraising platform that helps people raise more money for improving our world without having to give more.",NO

3) **These firms would charge x2 - x5 more for a one off unique report like this, my quote is very reasonable as it is a fraction of what the cost should really be.** There is no one else that can carry out this report and get results, not even those consulting firms. There is an opportunity cost for me spending the time to write out this report, and it would be better for me personally to spend my time on other things.

  

Ke Xu from Hubei province in China who is a bit of a genius loved puzzles. At age 16 he was recognised by his school teachers as an incredibly gifted student. He studied English and then flew to the UK to study Mathematics at Cambridge University and graduated 3rd in a class of 250. He went on to work at Goldman Sachs and then moved to a firm in London called G-Research who are one of the leaders in quantitative trading strategies. He developed a set of strategies which would make G-Research a substantial amount of money, but after only being paid $662,720 for his work, he considered leaving because he felt G-Research were not paying him enough money.

The company scrambled the code that were running the trades after hearing he might leave, but Ke Xu built a decomplier that could translate the code. He proceeded to work from home until he formally handed in his resignation letter. He said in the letter ""I am leaving for family reasons with no immediate plans for other things"".

Since Ke Xu left the firm so abruptly, G-Research hired attorneys to get a court order requiring Ke Xu to return anything he had taken and to hand in his passport. By that time Ke Xu was already cruising at 30,000 feet. By the time Ke Xu landed in Hong Kong there were people waiting to confront him. The attorneys got a travel ban against Ke Xu and managed to extradite him back to the UK because they believed Ke Xu had downloaded the algorithmic trading strategies that were being used at the firm. In effect Ke Xu could be using those strategies for himself or at a competitors firm effectively stealing money from G-Research. Ke Xu was jailed in the UK for 4 years, all because he had taken some important information.

A Combinatorial Auction Smart-Market is the NFT equivalent to Automated Market Makers for fungible tokens e.g. DEXs such as Uniswap. The outcome of this project will prototype Cardano Oracle Pools and Combinatorial Auction protocol to create decentralised Smart-Markets.

Our approach will implement the auction protocol on-chain to collect the offers/bids and settle game assets efficiently. Oracle Pool members efficiently calculate optimal allocations.

Combinatorial Auctions are the NFT equivalent of AMMs. Combinatorial Auctions are a type of smart-market where the asset/good is non-divisible, i.e. an NFT.

*   A Smart-Market is a periodic auction which is cleared using an optimisation algorithm. For GNFTs, offers to swap a GNFT (gaming non-fungible token) for another GNFT, or Token, e.g. ADA are submitted to the auction. The offers/bids are submitted as transactions. When the auction closes, Oracles in a Pool can aggregate offers/bids and emit an efficient allocation.
*   Combinatorial Auctions and Smart-Markets are used all over the place both for optimising supply chains and physical or virtual resource allocations. For example Smart Markets for Water Resources.
*   The great majority of mainstream programmers develop in imperative programming languages, but Cardano needs Haskell/Plutus devs to grow. In addition, practically no developers are familiar with Computer Science Concurrency programming models that the ExUXTO model represents.
*   Developers learn best through examples they can relate to, and get excited by. Entrepreneurs get excited by new market opportunities. On Ethereum, DeFi and Game Non-Fungible Tokens (GNFT) are exciting many developers and entrepreneurs. The combination however has not been explored. We will prototype a Decentralised Smart-Market Exchange (SMX) protocol. that implements a time-locked periodic auction to efficiently trade virtual creative assets. We will document this process to educate others.

Hello Philippe,

Could you please provide a breakdown of the cost involved at 1B. I feel that is a very reasonable request.

You write ""we value our time differently"". Based on your proposal, we have no way of assessing that. There is no overview of hours involved. Like you want a Salary, does that mean you will work full-time for the community. Or part time. Improving website. that by itself could have huge range or price.

To be honest, for a proposal of 750000ADA I really expect a breakdown of cost. Not adding that feels highly unprofessional to me. I do agree with you that future price of ADA is irrelevant. We all need to vote based on current price. And I also agree that ultimately community decides.

I like the Podcast, and I can see a proposal of 750K for a 6 month project making sense. But it really depends on your cost breakdown. And when any project requires higher funding, the scrutiny of cost should also be higher.

I have never been affected by this but you have to admit the irony. Having a decentralized system and making a centralized website to blacklist something. In a trustless environment you try to establish a service based on trust. It is even more ironic if you say you want funding to keep independent.

I am just sharing my opinion here and I think that decentralized funding should not be used to centralize information which result in any kind of blacklist. This is an attempt to gain power where no one should have this kind of power.",NO

We need to evaluate the consequences of the two possible outcomes of your proposal. If it pass you guys will continue to deliver the same great content perhaps with better audio quality etc. If it doesn't then you'll keep your podcast and continue to get funded by the CF.

Another tangent on this matter is that the ecosystem can benefit from getting a wide variety of content creators, each one with different skill sets, style and appeal to different demographics and interest.

750 000 ADA is a big chunk of the fund in % and a pretty nice sum to receive before Goguen and Voltaire go live. With price appreciation coming in the next 6-9 months, you're probably looking at a multiple of that when converted to whatever currency you need ( and even if it stays stable, 75K is a decent pot for a channel). I struggle to make sense of why so much is needed right now and whether it is the best investment of ADA we can make collectively. I guess that's what we are here for, decide whether the same investment given to 3,4,5 other projects would ultimately help Cardano more.

I also think that you should be transparent in your other sources of funding as I thought the other sources were there to exactly do that - support you to create content. Will you maintain that source of funding or drop it and run exclusively on this fund?",NO
28/Sep/20 8:43 PM,323341,1714,Philippe Pierre-Antoine,"@samuel  The proposal is transparent. We indicate that we have a staff. We also indicate that we have platform expenses. Rick and myself will be taking a salary as well. All these factors are stated in the proposal. That's the beauty of voting. You choose which projects you'd like to fund. Speculation as to what price what be in 6 months is not a business model. We will be using funds for expenses. Price could be up and price could be down. We still recognize as income and we must pay our share of taxes and fees.  
  
The funding address may be public. I'm not sure. We will complete the task at hand and continue providing episodes for the next six months. We've been around for 2 years. We're not going anywhere anytime soon. Individualized itemized expenses will not be provided. I recommend that you check out the DASH governance episode coming out soon. They talk about some of the things they learned through the proposal process. It may clarify some points of contention. Even if we don't have your support, we value your opinion and we appreciate when you tune into the podcast. Your ADA, your vote. Please vote for projects you believe in. There are many out there. We'll also be premiering a series called the Gauntlet where we will be bringing community project proposals on so we can get a better understanding of what's going on. We hope you join us.

The data taken imported from Fitbit is data that the user has already consented to store on Fitbits servers. When they connect via my website permission again is asked via the Fitbit API and the connection call, it also asks how long the data transfer access is for allowed e.g. 1 day, 1 week or 1 year and constantly asks again if anything changes such as browser, mobile device, IP address etc.

All I collect is a users email address and their number of steps, distance traveled per day and a few other fields - it is all transparent and the user has given permission to store it and share with 3rd parties via Fitbit.

I store the data within a secure Azure SQL Database. There are GDPR implications which I have knowledge of and ask the user to accept the conditions before joining my website so there are 2 places that opt-ins are required.  

The anonymisation of data and sharing with Health Care is further down on the roadmap. I currently work for NHS Digital in the UK and deal daily with sensitive data and know how to both anonymise the data and the minimum data that is permitted to be shared. You have to work closely with the authorities and pass many levels of scrutiny before any data can be shared and stored which course I will be doing. I have worked with the Police, Fire Brigade and Ambulance Services in the past so I have experience dealing in these sensitive areas.

I will build this part of the roadmap out slowly, only when I am satisfied the system works and passes all regulations in the UK will I look to expand to other territories. There are lots of other high priority tasks to develop before this area is pursued. I will also be seeking partners to integrate with that will also help with the legal aspect of the project.",NO

The number of subscribers it not of any interest. When it is too low, you should stop the business itself.

I guess that it require about 2\*8 hours of getting all information and 8 hours to create the podcast. Then 4 hours of editing and 3 hours (\*2 = 6 hours) for broadcast. 2 hours to respond to feedback. Total hours per podcast about 36 hours.

A fair value per hour working (Compared to Dutch standards for high quality work) is $ 75 (Tax not subtracted). So a total of $ 2.700 per video

Compared to the price of ADA now about $0,10 and estimated in about 6 months from now being $0,2 brings that to an average of $0,15. Though $2.700 equals 18.000 ADA. Times 24 equals 432.000 ADA.

\- Describe your solution to the problem:

Ada Ads that drive the Cardano narrative to its ideal clients. Those ideal clients do not live in the crypto space; they live at the problem.  

**Title + Problem statement = a solution**

Ads that drive positioning narrative of Cardano to its ideal clients that live the issues Cardano could solve.

As our proposal is long term, we are not asking for Ada that has a limited life; instead, we are asking for delegation as that provides a predictable long term budget.

Voting - we are hoping that once we start producing Ads, and before we have any metrics to back those choices, like when a new Ad campaign begins, delegators could vote between the Ad choices given.

I agree that if there is a bridge between different chains already then we could just use that. I wonder why substrate needed one though, and the overall concept for it is available on GitHub from open-sourcing Chainsafe/Chainbridge Github repo. As well as the support documentation Chainbridge-spec, its deploy repo Chainbridge-deploy, supporting articles, and team building it is in contact with me. I have been working on this to bridge between substrate and Ethereum but have had trouble installing the runtime and pallet to the substrate node as it requires alpha3 revision instead of the 0.6.1 revision that is being used currently, requiring a downgrade and sacrifice the Contracts pallet and thus resulting in a stall in that project until we can figure out how to add a Chainbridge pallet to the updated runtime. In the meantime, if Cardano has a way to issue tokens, I know we can modify the router to receive a message to a Cardano smart contract. I don't believe I can do this alone but if we hire Chainsafe to do it or a group of devs devoted to this issue including myself (been in college/coding Bootcamp for development for 2 years, have no life), we can get it solved.

To your global players comment, that is because they don't want people to be aware of their competitors (which you pointed out). They are already the dominant player. This is a dominant strategy for them.

However, the dominant strategy for underdog players is not the same strategy. The dominant strategy for underdogs is to raise awareness of the cons of the dominant player and the pros of themselves, with bias if necessary.

Cardano is not the dominant player; it is the underdog to Ethereum. Cardano's dominant marketing strategy is to highlight the the pros and cons, with or without bias. Personally, I think the pros and cons could be very unbiased and the comparison would still show Cardano has better technology and potential than most of its competitors.

Now daedalus has been historically way too slow in terms of development and introduction of new features. That's what prompted me to create this wallet. The idea here is to use the \`cardano-wallet\` back-end (which daedalus also relies upon) and to create a plug-in system that can easily be deployed as standalone apps or plug-ins that run within the wallet - while also being multi-platform (compile once, deploy anywhere).

I suspect enabling anything of the type on daedalus would take much longer and cost much more than the very small amount I'm asking to build this. For each hardfork, I'd expect changes in the cardano-wallet internally, but not so much on its API. It is super easy to update/add new API calls on the architecture I'm building and I guarantee you it's going to be cheaper than updating the behemoth that deadalus is.",NO

That is the thing. You have to use EMURGOs libraries to help yourself in development of Cardano related apps. And this is perfect.

We agree that Rust/JS libraries could be used on iOS. The thing is you have to wrap them first to make them useful for native Swift development process. It feels like you have to force every developer on each code language to do it by themself. We are not writing everything from scratch - take a look at the master branch we have created 2 years ago to demonstrate that.

In case of proposal. As you can see reading the code, we are covering Wallet Rest API right now. After that we will provide a useful bunch of Swift interfaces to make the interaction with the GraphQL API server simple for native Swift developers. It means you don't have to use Emurgo's library to interact with the blockchain. Also it means you don't need a multimillion funds to cover APIs and provide an interfaces. Don't you agree now?

It would also be fair if someone provide Swift SDK alongside with JS/Rust implementations. As much as Rust and JS Swift is also cross platform. Is not it? We are not creating a ship to reach the stars from scratch. Another SDK would be also good for the decentralization.

That's why we've never done it for Yoroi (although there is a way to do it which is every plugin is a separate extension and Yoroi whitelists them to modify the app, which works but is not ideal).

Since Daedalus isn't submitted to any of these stores, I don't think there is anything blocking them from adding this kind of plugin support.

Would definitely appreciate discussing this more with you. If I'm understanding what you're describing correctly, it would be an incentive structure for devs to be rewarded for participating, correct?  
  
If what you described were built, don't you still need to reach devs and make them aware that this incentive structure exists?  
  
There can be many many methods for attracting devs over and I'm open to learning and trying any of them, but what this proposal is for is to create a team and process around directly reaching those devs where ever they are. My assumption, and I could be wrong, is that there are a lot of talented people out there that are working on projects and are too busy and focused on whatever they're working on to be actively looking for something new and better. The goal is to just put in the effort to find them and tell them all about Cardano, and then be able to guide them to wherever it is that fits their needs and skillset, one of those locations could be an open repo of code examples for them to start working on.

This conceptually feels a lot like Brave Browser's Basic Attention Token (BAT): https://brave.com/brave-rewards/

My naïve explanation of that is that they essentially:

*   subvert standard advertising whilst you browse (function as an adblocker).
*   replace it with ethical advertisements instead: ""How are ads in Brave Rewards different?"" (above link)
*   rewards **viewers** of ads with BATs
*   lets users donate BATs to site creators
*   or BATs can be traded on crypto exchanges.

Some of it looks a bit pro-forma, but I paste my base template at the start of a review and then cut and curate during the review of an idea. I try to include various examples to help you flesh out missing sections.

Please take a look at supporting documentation for the Catalyst process, particularly this document:

\* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oE_cnP0gksdAanXV4w5DYaDNp_tbYEvyHhTUG4HYZ3Q/edit?ts=5f4ffe33

Remember there's a timeline for the proposal process, so don't feel pressure to flesh everything out completely right now, but you want to have refined this before voting starts obviously.

Relevant to this idea:

\*\*RISK\*\*

\*) Please include/expand a risk assessment area. Even something basic like:

\* ""if a family crisis happens and we don't have as much time as we thought …"" <= Although a team of 3 mitigates this somewhat

\* ""if I unexpectedly lose access to a critical team member during the project my backup plan is …""

\*\*COSTS\*\*

\*) Your costs breakdown is either missing or unclear. How did you arrive at this figure?

\*) Staff costs?

\*) Equipment/licensing costs?

\*) External suppliers or contracts?

\*\*PROVENANCE\*\*

\*) There are a few claims here referencing external work. Can you consider how the voters can confirm the truth of this?

e.g. If you are linking to your github or linkedin profiles, perhaps put a reference there that you can also put in your proposal? Or just link back to your proposal from there?

I did duck into the telegram channel, so have already confirmed that side.

\*\*MILESTONES\*\*

\*) Have you thought about how funding might be released in tranches? What cadence would work for you? What sort of reports or deliverables are you able to provide to stakeholders?

\*\*IP/Copyright\*\*

\*) Intellectual Property (IP) hasn't been addressed in this proposal. I assume all IP and licensing will remain vested with the content team? The outcome of this proposal will be a service for the community?

\*\*METRICS\*\*

\*) How are you going to measure success?

\*) Can you measure 'degrees' of success realistically?

\*\*GENERAL\*\*

\*) ""… when is possible content about Cardano to the average person in the street helping onboard new people to the Cardano blockchain."" => Given the channel/series will otherwise focus on developers this might risk diluting your focus. Perhaps consider if you are including it, whether there should be a clearer idea in the proposal about roughly how much non-developer content you intend to create.

\*) How does this channel intend to differentiate itself from other generic channels targeting developers in Fund 2? In particular, you have mentioned a focus on female developers, but how? A couple of ideas spring to mind for me, but it would be good to see some thoughts in the proposal:

*   Guests that focus on developing a software career for women?
    
*   Building a stable of network/mentoring programs across the community? Fairly common in large enterprise and government. e.g. I work in Australia Government and I am aware that it is a major focus on the cadet and grad programs, plus there are leadership oriented ones: https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/learning-and-development/women-digital

28/Sep/20 2:47 AM,322511,1588,Serotonin,"@stackchain  ""I also think it will improve in time but how much?"" - The answer is buried in the statistics, but off the top of my head, I think the number of pools that will produce 1-2 blocks is proportional to d (assuming constant k). So when d is 0 there will be roughly 3 times as many pools producing 1-2 blocks/epoch as there are now.

I completely agree that k should be much higher and CH said they were having meetings about making a rather drastic change to k (~250 if I recall correctly). Delegation 'portfolios' will help also, it's just a matter of how much time it takes to setup that feature.

To play devil's advocate, everything seems to be working as one would ""expect."" k is pretty close to the number of pools that people might consider are sustainable. And who is to say what a good number of pools is? Sure we have over 1000 stake pools, but is that a good number? Is it too many? If not, what is too many? I.e. at what point do we stop and say ""we're decentralized enough for the current state of Cardano""? And if SPOs are indeed operating as businesses, then why would they be driven away so easily because they hadn't turned a profit after a mere few months?

There are definitely a lot of people running in the cloud. There are some that are co-locating. (that's bringing your computer down to a main hub and renting space with a lot of other computers).

I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss the cloud servers... i am with you in that if everyone is on AWS cloud, how is it decentralized? or is it even? I had those concerns but weighed against the guaranteed uptime and maintenance, its not a terrible choice. But, definitely not as decentralized as it could be.

Co-location is a good uptime choice but you sacrifice being able to keep an eye on your system. You have to physically drive to where it is if you need to do anything that you can't do remotely.

With a home based node your playing with fire... internet could go out, electricity, etc..

I mean this as no disrespect but if you are asking for 750,000 ADA out of 2,167,805 ADA that is 34.5% of the total funding for this round. If you are already receiving funding from The Cardano Foundation then why ask for 34.5% from fund 2?

There is currently 79 million ADA in the treasury and this is just the first real fund. My opinion is that if you are going to ask for that much wait until a bigger round of funding and I will vote yes for it. Another idea is to split the funding up between a few rounds and I will also vote for each round. I may still vote for it depending on the other proposals in this round.

I don't know how comfortable normal people will be with a subreddit. I am trying to keep this simple and there are a good amount of people that don't know / use subreddits. Otherwise, you could definitely set it up for that. I see your point.

One of the reasons for the show every two weeks in a different place is to have meetups for developers to come talk with pool operators and have questions asked and answered. It's also continuity and to showcase the pool operators... I know all this stuff can be done with zoom and everyone sitting in their living room but the idea is to do something different - get out and meet people. Physically meeting with people gives it a different vibe... Hopefully that can even happen. Obviously we need to have this pandemic under control before any of this can be done.

I agree with you on your first point. I always figured that number might have to be adjusted.. 2 mil is the number where you should average 1 block per epoch but delegators are not going to be happy if they see 2 blocks one epoch and 0 in the next epoch even though that would get them consistant rewards if it continued like that. I am open to moving that number around.

I figured that by the time this got started, the traveling would be a bit more open but you are correct, currently it would not work. A big part is to also have meetups so that we can get developers in the room with some pool operators. Be able to answer questions, etc.

I have some ideas about the website and actually met up with someone else proposing a website that might be able to incorporate what I am doing into his site... But practically, I see a space for someone who wants to delegate to be able to add the amount of ada they have to a running total. when that total gets to the magic number, whatever that turns out to be, they all delegate during the next epoch what they pledged to the pool.

28/Sep/20 1:18 AM,322511,1588,anthony,"@serotonin  Thanks for commenting. It's the business part of, ""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?"", that I am gearing this project to... we have 500 small businesses that are in real danger of shutting down.

I also think it will improve in time but how much? there has not been any noticeable improvement so far or at least enough for this not to be a problem. We are over 1/3 of the way to full decentralization and when d is 0 how much will that help? When are they going to fix k? that probably should have been done already if k is suppose to represent the number of pools. We have over 1000 pools and k is still at 150. That should have been moved at least 500 by now.

My point is, and the point of a lot of struggling pools, is that they don't want to be at the mercy of other outside variables that they can not control. They want to do something and help themselves. If we gain 50 Cadano business and loose 200, is that going to be successful first fund?",NO

28/Sep/20 12:34 AM,322239,1475,Swarles_Barkley,"I agree on the general principle that people proposing ideas should not necessarily present their personal finances to prove they really need the money. But there is a difference between, say, a programmer in gainful employment at Google presenting an idea to develop a dapp and a brand ambassador from the Cardano foundation presenting an idea to get paid for doing outreach for Cardano. The first is obviously fundable (depending on the quality of the idea, of course), whereas the second is obviously not (as this person is already getting paid by the Cardano foundation for doing the same job).

BigPey to me seems to belong much more strongly in the second column. At a 5% fee, 300 million ADA staked (both Bloom pools), 5% inflation of the Cardano protocol and about half of all ADA staked, my napkin math has BigPey earning around $75K per year from the Bloom pools at ADA's current price (I'm sure there's a mistake somewhere in there). That's gross, but his infrastructure costs should be nowhere near eroding that juicy income stream.

He's earned every penny of that, but he's earned it through his community work and Youtube channel. Does anyone really believe BigPey would stop uploading episodes if this proposal didn't get funded? His pool is tied to the channel, he needs to keep up the work anyway.

IMO, I don't think that the data offered at PoolTool creates enough incentives for corruption to the point of harming Cardano and its community to a considerable extent.

Let's think about the worst case scenarios:

If a website that provides pool metrics decides to act maliciously, it can forge metrics in order to benefit some SPOs. This can encourage delegates to direct their votes to some SPOs, but I only see this as a problem if the parameters k, a0 and d are not aligned to allow decentralization of the network.

I wouldn't want there to be any hidden interests for sites like PoolTool, but the metrics they currently provide have no power to hurt the blockchain in any substantial way.

Furthermore, believing in Cardano's promising future, I don't think we only have 1 or 2 sites for metrics evaluation and as all metrics can be easily verified by others, I think that an attempt to act maliciously would make any data provider and metrics hurt their reputation.

That said, I don't believe that collusion and corruption in these cases has the potential to harm Cardano, but I may be wrong. I think we need to focus more on creating the right incentives in the blockchain's parameters.",NO

Please do not get me wrong. I have no doubt in the quality of your videos which indeed are outstanding.

But in my opinion it is not worth 750,000 ADA currently. The actual target group should be developers and I doubt that Cardano at the moment has a huge benefit in video production and publication without any products made by developers running on Cardano. It is not the time to spend the big money on marketing yet.

Therefore I made the calculation based on the subscribers. I assumed a developer with real interest would not just watch and never come back but become a subscriber. So a small percentage of the subscribers will be developers and so subscribers are the most important part for the moment. Without any products running yet, the only target left is the price, even if that is not the intention at all.",NO

We are starting our new Gauntlet series where we question new proposals and allow the community a greater understanding of what projects are being pushed in Catalyst. TCE will evolve as new products are released to market. We will have a developer series as well. As you know, Goguen still isn't out so there isn't much to work with in the smart contracts field.

""This means it doesn't attract new interest"" is an incorrect statement.

We have a range of content that includes bridge building between different crypto projects, stake pool operator spotlights, recordings with scientist/engineers, live sessions to speak about current events, and more incoming.

We avoided the hyped and eccentric titles and market speculation videos that many YouTube platforms use to pick up cheap or incidental views with low quality content. For example:

The titles and content are designed and intended for the professionals, dedicated viewers, and people serious about Cardano.

Value is critical, and resources deliver value - I think the first component to put in place is a mechanism to incentivize developers to contribute to an open repo of code examples - that will open the door for developer / prospect matchmaking - point being strong value prop(s) need(s) to be there (e.g. - you can get clients, you can receive bounties for new application-specific dapp/Plutus/Marlow code example submissions, you can receive bounties for converting your ETH dapp to Plutus, etc).  
  
To hit dev entrepreneurs building for themselves you'll (in most cases I think) need to swing during the decision / entry phase as it's a hard sell a lean operation to migrate code - sophisticated funnel marketing can help with this, but having an available open repo of sample code will provide onramps to mitigate barriers and help accelerate that paths of inbound developers.

Youtube has a few advantages over Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, etc. : Targeting and audience for your ads on Youtube can be 99% precise, because you can handpick videos and channels, where you want your ads to run. It is a lot of work to setup, but it is supe effective!

On Facebook and Instagram for example you can't target so precise. You can setup a few parameters and then trust the algorythm, to deliver the ads to the right people. From my experience it is not as effective as on Youtube and in the end for the same money you get lss relevant new users.

Plus the crypto community is mainly on youtube. There are huge channels around and on Facebook there are mainly newssites like cointelegraph.

And to finish things up you have to work with subtitles on FB and IG to make your videos work, because most people will see it without sound when scrolling through. The lack of sound limits your effectiveness of the videos.",NO

Definitely a great document and everyone who is proposing a business idea should use it.

However, all we are doing is writing out a research report and 377k ADA ($29k) is a fee being charged for writing out the report.

It's the fee for providing the service (time/skills/experience). It is a fairly standard rate from what I have seen working with consulting firms.

  

This is a good question.:+1: **""Would the APY from staking be liquidated to fund project work?""**

We suggested that 100k ADA will be used as an incentive mechanism to keep us working on Cardano related things after the report is completed to continue driving value for the Cardano eco-system. APY proceeds will continue to be staked. Once ADA reaches $1 or more, only then will we be allowed to liquidate the 100k ADA principle and the interest.

Hope that makes more sense.",NO

I only have one issue from my suggestions I can't find (perhaps I am blind), which is to establish a link back here from an external location to confirm someone isn't scamming funds off the back of your team's work. Maybe a link to this idea on the bottom of the github readme?

Otherwise, just two suggestions from your new changes. Feel free to ignore them :)

\* Under risks you have things like: ""Store owners who intend to use this integration must be aware of their local legislation regarding the usage of crypto for the exchange of goods."" => Perhaps consider features to help shop owners on this front? Whether for tax purposes or to align with regulators. You can view this as an opportunity as well as a risk.

I'm confused about a few things though. Why does it need to be a dApp vs a simple app? Also, as Greg mentions, I don't see why you need 1 million ada for a stake pool to fund the work? It seems like an unrelated task (which would likely be higher priority to you before you even started working on the courses). It also makes it hard to see where you came up with the 1M ada number (or $100k for something you claim you could do yourself in 6 months). If you need it for stake pool pledge then why 1M...why not 500k or 250k or even 100k?

27/Sep/20 2:43 AM,322275,1491,Greg Pendlebury,"@icoresearchgroup  My reference to IOG's document was because they have great suggestions on the kinds of sections to include in a proposal, so that reviews and voters can understand the details (not just the vision). You haven't provided those details, so this reads as just a high level pitch right now. I can't review that.

For example, you've asked for 100k ADA to put in your staking pool... it would be nice to unpack the financials behind that in terms of what it would do for the project (i.e. not for your team, given you flagged it as 'incentive'). Would the APY from staking be liquidated to fund project work? Or is it just a non-refundable signing bonus you are asking for? Then you further ask for 277k ADA for taxes and 'expenses', which was actually the more troubling part... you have lumped the entire real project budget into 'expenses' with no breakdown on what that will be spent on.

To quote IOG's suggestion: ""Complex problems often need sufficient funding to be solved. This is understood by the community at Project Catalyst. However, anyone voting on these proposals should be able to know how the funding is being spent. Giving a detailed breakdown of how the budget will be spent.

I understand the concern. As you said, use with caution is correct.

If that's the case, then creating a timeline doesn't seem necessary as it's pretty much a one step process.  

As far as Emurgo seeking community funds, I'm not sure what to think of that, in principle. In many situations I would see it as 'double dipping,' but the paltry 5000 ada requested basically only covers the time it takes for them to divert this through the catalyst review process (I basically see this proposal as a training wheels example for the quality of proposal that they hope to see as well as get the community juices flowing). Also, isn't the idea that Cardano eventually becomes fully decentralized?

Nice question.:ok_hand:

With some proposals, you will be able to track a direct correlation between the price of ADA and the success of a proposal. Think of Uniswap as an example, it encourages people to buy ETH to make transactions so the value of ETH goes up. We can see the amount of ETH uniswap uses, uniswap accounts for 20% of all the Tx fees on Ethereum. If we fund proposals like this you could say the funding process has been successful (assuming the financing cost is significantly lower than the value created for the network).

Some proposals will have more of an indirect effect. For example, the proposal brings more people into the Cardano eco-system to hold ADA in perpetuity because holding ADA provides increasing utility to the holder. It is harder to track directly how these proposals make the value of ADA go up and requires more qualitative judgement.

There are issues with the current funding process and they will become more prominent as the system grows. However, they have been solved before in the prior decentralised funding model, but I can elaborate on that topic further if this proposal gets funded.",NO

A. First, this is a long term proposition. As such, we are asking for our stake pool to get delegated to by, Cardano Foundation, IOG, Emurgo, and Ada holders at large. By our calculations, anything close to saturation would yield over 200,000 Ada a year.

Our pool will be competitive, 2.5% margin, 340 costs, 1,000,000 pledge, as this is not a charity pool.

  

Q. Accountability?

A. We do not want N45B to be a personality, as Cardano has enough people marketing themselves as much as what they are after for Cardano, actions alone should judge us. On that note, our books, where every Lovelace goes, will be 100% open. N45B will become an LLC if we see any traction on our proposal.

  

Thanks for asking for clarity, hoping someone would; the Cardano community is not like any other crypto we have encountered.

When Bob sends qADA to Sarah he is transferring his balance of ADA in Liqwid Protocol.

qADA can be used \*in any Cardano application\* its a derivative that represents a Liqwid user's \*balance\* in the ADA market + accruing interest.

\\>""The ledger updates to show that the qTokenADA is posted as collateral and Sarah has an outstanding loan in ADA""

False those qADA are \*representing\* Sarah's ADA balance in the Liqwid ADA market. Sarah getting qADA from Bob just means Bob gave away his ADA + future interests. Sarah can use these qADA in any application or use her now increased \*underlying ADA balance\* to initiate a loan in the Liqwid ADA market. This is the core of your misunderstanding: a Liqwid user can't deposit qADA into the Liqwid ADA market to then initiate a loan, they can only redeem ADA + accrued interest. Therefore your line above where you are making the assumption Sarah is initiating a \*Liqwid borrow\* against the ADA market using qADA is \*100% completely false\*. She is using her ADA balance (+the balance of Bob she now owns). The ADA deposited \*never left the Liqwid ADA pool\* and is also the only asset that can be used as collateral to initiate a loan in that specific Liqwid pool. This entire time you are confusing underlying with derivatives that represent underlying + interest. I am just pointing you to the current money market implementations on Ethereum to highlight where your scenario's are verifiably incorrect.

Sarah's Liqwid loan is backed by her (or another user's) deposits into the ADA Liqwid market. Her ADA \*Liqwid account balance\* is being represented in the form of interest accruing qADA. What about this basic concept that exist in every Ethereum DeFi money market protocol today are you still not understanding?

""Mike is expecting qTokenADA"" This is the only correct thing you have correctly stated in your entire scenario. This is how Compound finance cTokens work today. Mike is depositing his ADA and minting qADA to represent his Liqwid ADA balance + interest gains. The entire qToken purpose is to account for a user's \*underlying balance\* as it accrues interest over time. This is where I pointed out your initial scenario of minting 1:1 exchange of ADA for qADA completely ignored the time value of money concept.

Your scenario is trying to separate ADA (the underlying asset) from the derivative token minted by a Liqwid user's balance when they \*deposit ADA to earn interest\* without realizing the qADA is tied to a Liqwid ADA balance. To redeem that ADA (+ any accrued interest) you have to swap your qADA for the underlying ADA + interest. Again this is a basic concept of time value of money that holds in the derivative token models of Compound and Aave today. Have your reviewed any of these since your original comment? Have you looked at the chart I attached to my 1st response highlighting the Compound cUSDT to USDT exchange rate over time?",https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/idea/323183/32256/download

And I am posting this here so that people can see it without having to scroll through our comments. Below is a quote from your first response in the comment thread and it is in paragraph 10 of your annotated attachment:

""Specifically when a user exchanges their qTokens, they are also exchanging their corresponding stake in the Liqwid ADA pool. So the question becomes which one of the users in your scenario gave away their qADA (and in the process their underlying ADA + future interest) and why did you not update their balance to show this transfer of ownership.""

In my scenario, I assumed that the ledger was updated. Bob deposited ADA into the pool and now has qTokenADA that lay claim to that ADA. Bob then trades the qTokenADA to Sarah and the qTokenADA ledger updates to show that Sarah now has the qTokenADA, and therefore the claim on the ADA that was originally Bob's. Then, Sarah decides to post the qTokenADA as collateral (she can do this since she technically owns the ADA in the pool) and borrows the ADA. The ledger updates to show that the qTokenADA is posted as collateral and Sarah has an outstanding loan in ADA. Then Sarah trades the ADA to Mike. Finally Mike, who has no idea that the ADA originally came from the pool, deposits the ADA back into the pool while Sarah's loan is still outstanding. Mike is expecting qTokenADA.  

Do new qTokenADA get minted for Mike? Or does the ledger know that those specific ADA tokens are already associated to the qTokenADA currently posted as collateral? I could not find anything in the whitepaper that suggests the qTokenADA ledger would know that the incoming ADA already has qTokenADA associated with it. Is the ADA that Sarah borrowed tagged in anyway?

1\. I am missing sense of timeline - so that we can benchmark the project against its deliverable goals. When do you expect which stage to be competed? How long will it take, what if there are delays, etc.

That is crucial in understanding if budget is viable in the first place. Overall number is difficult to interpret in absence of specifics.

26/Sep/20 4:09 PM,322572,1596,Michael,"@greg.pendlebury  Okay, I understand your concerns, so let me try and address them:

Firstly, we are surrounded by distinct open source communities with distinct resources. They have their tools, we have ours. So yes, I think that a singular focus on one bridge is the most conservative approach in terms of risk that still yields irreversible progress. It's not just grant risk, though I absolutely agree with that, it's also the opportunity costs we suffer when the underlying tools shift unexpectedly. So, yes, I want to get to funding grants, bounties, and hackathons, and maybe even further scope like maintaining and improving upon actively used (monetized) services that run on top of Cardano.

But I'm not going to upsell the possibility that we can just throw a large project on there and expect it to work, with the present ecosystem. That would be too bold. This is why I asked for a drop in the bucket, to show simple things can work, as well as the Project Catalyst process. There are always future rounds of funding if getting paid is really our top priority. The best way to handle this risk is to not keep entertaining it in the budget.

I don't have a background in using gitcoin, but I am constantly researching the process and the broader plan. Those overheads you're mentioning, can you guess who's paying for them? I put a ""drop in the ocean"" in requested funds because it was implied that I would cover what else needed to get done on my end. But that's outside the scope of Project Catalyst, and frankly, nobody's paying me to entertain criticisms about the skin I'm putting in the game. I'm volunteering as respectfully as I can.

I am in the process of reaching out to developers on other forums, including social media and gig websites. Regardless of that, this is a gesture within the larger open source community. Gitcoin's mission and Cardano's mission both pursue equality and meritocracy as guiding principles in a economic framework that heavily revolves around making the most prolific (and qualified) creators a lot of money. If we are still considering the humanitarian side of this, wouldn't it be better if Cardano organically grew its community around a combination of sustainability and scalability that wasn't constrained to a DAO payroll? Maybe I'm outspoken on this, but my ideal version of the Cardano ecosystem doesn't include a single company of developers, or a single consortium of entrepreneurs. If anything, having competing entities within the Cardano ecosystem hardens our broader plans, makes them more robust, and is to our collective benefit in the long term.

I'm not giving you a probable ROI, just like I'm not asking for nine figure grants. Expectations should be managed. But for 12k ADA (and I understand that is a lot of money in some parts of the world), I'm very confident that the one measurable outcome we care about (pushing out solid code) will be reflected in the number of commits and number of bugs found via bounty. Additionally, I'm confident that we will see ancillary benefits in social outreach and active participation within Project Catalyst when there is a clear and self-evident statement that all developers have a standing invitation to get paid if their idea supports the continuation and propagation of an equitable, open source, and censorship-resistant community.

I'm working on this, regardless of Project Catalyst. If my proposal strikes you as substantively lacking in detail or is otherwise offensive, vote against it.",NO

Para que estén al tanto nomás, un par de comentarios en inglés están diciendo que les interesa la propuesta pero faltan más detalles. Mi respuesta fue que tenemos más información disponible para publicar pero que sólo estamos siguiendo los consejos de Dor (líder del proyecto) donde recomienda, para esta primera fase de presentación de propuestas, sólo focalizarnos en el problema y la solución e ir agregando información (volumen de trabajo, presupuesto, etc) en las próximas fases.

Thanks for the feedback Rick!  
  
The infrastructure (if you mean the hardware) is well researched, it highly scalable, one could simply serve 128 drives from 2 machines (for redundancy failover) check NetApp FAS Multi-Path High Availability cluster, it can be done also in smaller configs RPi + 1 or 2 disks…. so it can suite service providers of different scale and capital abilities.

The research would include list of laternatives with rough cost estimates and cost per capacity metrics.

From the software side, our research would include few proposlasof different alternatives with different trade-offs for relevant features, in the second funding round, the community would decide whcih aproach to take, the reserach ouutput from this round would include time for further research (theoretical) and expected time to implement to MVP variant and cost estimate. These development expectations would be refined after the research would done, at which point another requests for the actuall funding to implement MVP would be submitted.

26/Sep/20 3:45 PM,322422,1563,mrclw,"@stackchain  i can only comment on what i see in the proposal and it states ""The Cardano Stake Pool Library will offer many ways for the user to investigate and filter the stake pool list \[..\] Technical Filters

Filter by stake pool on the following:

\- up time

\- saturation

\- number of created blocks

\- (ROA) return on ADA

\- fees

\- pledge

\- number of delegates

this already exists so it could be considered a ""waste"" of funds. That's why i focused on the ""Non-Technical"" aspect which i also think is very much needed and would be a good addition to the ecosystem. That's why i proposed a possible cooperation with adapools to integrate the non technical aspect on their website OR to focus on the non technical side like description, country, maybe introduction videos etc.

to be considered as a proposal i think the project needs to outline the added value it has over other already existing tools more clearly.

As per benchmarking, the goal of THIS proposal is to simply create a high level architecture and conduct a feasibility study, I may need some expert opinions from a zk proofs researchers, and other experts, funding would be used towards that, mu time on composing the inputs would be free of charge. Idea is to create a more detailed execution plan and ask for additional funding rounds, which is how traditional venture capital works.  
  
\> Also - I see budget value requested and what the general intent is - but is there a financial break down how these funds are going to be spent and their usage more precisely? That's for accountability measure.

26/Sep/20 11:26 AM,322909,1632,Daniel Ribar,"Hello Mark,

This looks fantastic.

I've been huge fan of online storage platforms - but for the most part lacked execution in the long run. E.g, I've been following Sia since inception and the progress has been very slow. Out of curiosity - is there anything useful from their end? I've noticed you've liked other aspects from various platforms. But that's just curiosity on my end unrelated to your efforts.

On another part - this proposal seems light on benchmarking. Have you thought about how will you measure success metrics when using these funds? What will determine if the initial scope was a good effort or if it will eventually need more work? What is the timeline of these deliverables? Trying to decipher line items mentioned in the proposal.

Also - I see budget value requested and what the general intent is - but is there a financial break down how these funds are going to be spent and their usage more precisely? That's for accountability measure.

Lastly, connected with your budget - do you feel you're asking enough money to make it happen?

26/Sep/20 11:23 AM,322194,1444,Greg Pendlebury,"Generally, I think your project is pretty inspiring and far reaching. Your challenge is going to be how to build a roadmap for it. My suspicion is people will be more forgiving of some vagueness in this area because the uncertainties are inherent in the task.

You want to position yourself to respond to emerging opportunities as you explore the problem space, instead of some arbitrary roadmap that pretends to know the definition of success at the outset.

With that in mind, I would encourage you to consider how to adopt agile methodologies like:

\* have a regular planning cadence for short term tasks... i.e. the next 2-3 weeks; keep aware of stuff out on the horizon, but know how to put it in box so it doesn't distract;

\* include periodic retrospectives to ask question from both yourself and stakeholders. Is what we are doing working as planned? Should we either pivot direction, or adjust our processes? Maybe every 6-8 weeks here. You are trying to balance short windows to correct before wastage sets in with long windows to give your processes time to really test the local conditions.

\* transparent reporting outwards, including of failures. Trying something ambitious and failing is still ok. Transparency gives stakeholders confidence.

I might be 'preaching to the choir' on some of this stuff. Apologies if so; I am just conscious there is still missing sections in the proposal.

\================

I have a cheat sheet of tips and advice I have been building during the review process. Some of it looks a bit pro-forma, but I paste my base template at the start of a review and then cut and curate during the review of an idea. I try to include various examples to help you flesh out missing sections.

Please take a look at supporting documentation for the Catalyst process, particularly this document:

\* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oE_cnP0gksdAanXV4w5DYaDNp_tbYEvyHhTUG4HYZ3Q/edit?ts=5f4ffe33

Remember there's a timeline for the proposal process, so don't feel pressure to flesh everything out completely right now, but you want to have refined this before voting starts obviously.

Relevant to this idea:

\*\*RISK\*\*

\*) Please include a risk assessment area. Even something basic like: (Please note these are examples only)

\* ""my assumptions about external funding (as per blah) may not emerge, which would result in ...""

\* ""if I unexpectedly lose access to a critical team member during the project my backup plan is ...""

\* As noted above, my sense is the community might be more accepting of risks in this space... but it still could to think about them.

\*\*COSTS\*\*

\*) Your costs breakdown is completely missing. I can't provide feedback on that obviously (yet).

\*\*PROVENANCE\*\*

\*) You will want to consider how to verify the provenance of your team in the world, such as linking to your linkedin profiles, perhaps put a reference there that refers back here? Identity theft and scams are real.

\*\*SCOPE\*\*

\*) Years 2 and 3 are ok to be fuzzy. But you are going to need to unpack some more details on Year 1.

\*) I noted above that it might be hard to lay out plans in a roadmap form, but even expressing a handful of ideas that your team might have put additional thought into and you are excited to look for opportunities to deploy.

\*) You want to try and make it less generic and convince voters that year 1 won't be 3 staff looking at each other in an office saying. ""Ok, now what?""

\*) I'd also like to see some detail on what you thoughts on staffing will look like and how much of the team already exists, versus new hires after funds are released.

\*\*MILESTONES\*\*

\*) Have you thought about how funding might be released in tranches? What cadence would work for you? What sort of reports or deliverables are you able to provide to stakeholders?

\*\*IP/Copyright\*\*

\*) Intellectual Property (IP) hasn't been addressed in this proposal. You've mentioned a number of partner proposals which all have their own IP which you might integrate with... but it seems reasonable that at least some published material (educational?) and/or source code might originate from this team.

Some common options below; these are examples for you:

\* All IP and licensing will remain vested with me. The outcome of this proposal will be a service for the community.

\* All IP will remain owned by myself, but creative outputs will be released under a relevant Creative Commons license (insert here). CC has various options which consider stances on things like attribution and commercialisation: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/

\* All IP will remain owned by myself, but source will be released under an open source license. Cardano source code is generally Apache v2... but there are other choices: https://choosealicense.com/ (MIT isn't bad for the very commercial space... GPLv3 if you are super ""public good ftw!"")

\* If you are feeling particularly altruistic: All IP will be transferred under the ownership of the Cardano Foundation, to be released (or not) under a license of their choice.

\*\*EXPERIENCE\*\*

\*) I can see you've expressed the problem, but can you expand on why \*you\*/your team are a good pick to solve it? Sell on some experience... background... maybe what makes you passionate about this?

\*) The right team can of course do this, but with only 3 staff initially and such a broad platform: ""Projects, Public Relations, Advocacy, Education, Community Engagement, Marketing""... it would seem you are going to both want a great internal skillset and be ready to draw deeply on partners.

\*) Have you thought about how to prioritise when you don't have enough resources? What are your core goals going to look like?

\*\*METRICS\*\*

\*) I think you've brain-stormed a number of great metrics that can be used in reporting. I think a regular reporting cadence on those numbers would be good to stakeholders, or at least targeted ones relevant to the time period. e.g. ""This month we focused on our educational drive with local small business owners... we saw this shift in adoption rates:""

\*\*RESEARCH\*\*

\*) Would you be prepared to break up milestones and include a research phase at the beginning before funding is unlocked for later stages? Please include details on costs here.

\*\*GENERAL\*\*

\*) ""This project will collaborate with international blockchain organizations such as IOG, Cardano Foundation and Emurgo"" => Has this already been discussed? Or is part of the proposal? The community cannot make this happen just by approving the funds. If this is guaranteed, perhaps it should be a risk? It depends on how central it might be to planning. Maybe you would proceed anyway, but at a slower pace?

\*) "" there is currently no strategy in place to facilitate blockchain tech adoption in all of West Africa"" => I am always careful about very broad statements of fact without evidence. Given you have cast a very broad net for goals it might be worth confirming the kind of market scans you did to look for both potential partners as well as competitors in this space. I know it is hard to 'prove' a negative.

\*) Just some random thoughts, but you might consider looking for stake pool operators working for the public good as well. They might consider some great opportunities to support 'public good' causes with staking rewards. There are a couple of proposals on this platform in that vein.",NO

Gentlemen, you've missed the point entirely. My failure to explain it better. Let me try again.

First of all - I have been a huge fan of pooltool ever since the beginning. But this no longer is a test game. We're off to the real world.

If you are supposed to be a true neutral gatekeeper of the information presented on the network - there should be clear line of such purpose. Of course you can potentially try to be impartial but the decision over personal interest will always linger there. I assume spending few lines addressing such concern may be suitable.

I am NOT saying that running a pool to keep wheels running for the platform is a no go. Just that it should be acknowledged HOW we plan to offset any potential conflicts of interest. Or at least list it to be aware of such.

This is not re-inventing the wheel. History has countless examples of why this doesn't work in the long-run if not addressed early on. I am confident that we don't need to revisit that by default.

IF this is going to be true lighthouse of information - it may benefit from its own identity. I am not saying this will not work - I said by considering/acknowledging such would boost its overall credibility. I am looking few years ahead. Is anyone seriously discounting this suggestion? I doubt that.

All of above is philosophical/moral question. Everyone has different understanding of these, and that's how it is. I can respect that and I don't expect it to be this way exactly. Just my curiosity asking to pause and think.

For the practical aspects. As I have mentioned elsewhere - this proposal doesn't mention in good detail how the funds are going to be spent and what metrics are going to be used to benchmark the effects of these funds on the project itself. If you come up with a specific numbers figure as included above - it owes itself reasoning for it. Again, my perspective only.

I don't think this is out of place. Apart from that - I love pootool - but we need to be able to discuss about things and not take them for granted.

I have high regards for your work! Keep it up!

Some of it looks a bit pro-forma, but I paste my base template at the start of a review and then cut and curate during the review of an idea. I try to include various examples to help you flesh out missing sections.

Please take a look at supporting documentation for the Catalyst process, particularly this document:

\* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oE_cnP0gksdAanXV4w5DYaDNp_tbYEvyHhTUG4HYZ3Q/edit?ts=5f4ffe33

Remember there's a timeline for the proposal process, so don't feel pressure to flesh everything out completely right now, but you want to have refined this before voting starts obviously.

Relevant to this idea:

\*\*RISK\*\*

\*) Please include/expand a risk assessment area. Even something basic like:

\* ""my assumptions about external funding (as per blah) may not emerge, which would result in ...""

\* ""if a family crisis happens and I don't have as much time as I thought ...""

\* ""if I unexpectedly lose access to a critical team member during the project my backup plan is ...""

\* ""turns out this was more complicated than I thought... I have broken the work up this way to validate...""

\* You are proposing setup the website, write a smart contract, market the platform and onboard 100 charitable projects within 6 months. Is there a more detailed plan on why this is realistic? What are your risks this won't happen?

\* And then expand to become a DEX? including DEFI?

\* DEFI, or any lending mechanism carries financial risk. This hasn't been unpacked.

\* How do you sell this to a charity? e.g. If I wanted to give 100 ADA to a charity right now they could have it. You propose to stake that instead, lets assume simple maths and say staking earns 5% APY (pretty close), you would like the charity to wait 20 years to get that money slowly? and the 'selling point' is that they will keep getting that money as long as 'FOX Funds' remains in existence? Why couldn't you just let charities decide whether they want to stake the ADA and they avoid the risk of FOX funds holding it for them?

\* I cannot see anywhere an assessment of the legal risks, or any legal fees.

\* Have you considered the impact if a regulator deems that you are offering financial services to charities? or the broader public? What regulators have you looked at? What plans do you have on this front?

\*\*COSTS\*\*

\*) Depending on on conversion rates you are looking for US$25k in ADA, plus ~US$10k (pounds conversion) from Ant and yourself (is that each or together?) resulting in 35-45k for 3 staff, working 6 months. Seems slightly low... but I can see it working. If you wanted to provide some more detail it would assist here.

\*) You've said Ant and yourself are drawing no wage. Are you working full time?

\*\*PROVENANCE\*\*

\*) There are a few claims here referencing external work. Can you consider how the voters can confirm the truth of this?

e.g. If you are linking to your github or linkedin profiles, perhaps put a reference there that you can also put in your proposal? Or just link back to your proposal from there?

\*\*SCOPE\*\*

\*) The scope is not clear. In one spot you say ""I will use the Cardano funds to pay for the development of the main website and to begin the advertising/promoting of the site."" but there's no actual product there.

\*) Then later you say Fund 2 success looks like ""To have the main website and the 'Support via Staking' funding working.""... so Fund2 is a site with 1 feature and staking.

\*) If you want to reference other background issues please add a section on scope to rule things 'in' and 'out'.

\*) You list a number things that would seem to need the existance of widely adopted stablecoins and/or fiat ramps. Are you proposing to build those? Depend on known projects externally (need an expressed risk)? Or am I misunderstanding?

\*) You have referenced significant multi-chain integrations and/or wrapped Multi-Asset Ledger (MAL) tokens. Are you proposing to build those? Depend on known projects externally (need an expressed risk)? Or am I misunderstanding?

\*) e.g. ""Any gifted Cryptocurrency to a project if not ADA is converted to ADA to undergo Staking."" Is that intending to be a legal entity maintaining wallets and using commercial exchanges... or an on-chain DEX?

\*) ""Any gifted Fiat Currency to a project is immediately converted to a stable coin and made available to lenders so it earns interest"" and DEFI?

\*) ""Any gifted ADA to a project immediately undergoes staking."" And an SPO...

\*\*MILESTONES\*\*

\*) Have you thought about how funding might be released in tranches? What cadence would work for you? What sort of reports or deliverables are you able to provide to stakeholders?

\*\*IP/Copyright\*\*

\*) Intellectual Property (IP) hasn't been address in this proposal. Some common options below; these are examples for you:

\* All IP and licensing will remain vested with me. The outcome of this proposal will be a service for the community.

\* All IP will remain owned by myself, but creative outputs will be released under a relevant Creative Commons license (insert here). CC has various options which consider stances on things like attribution and commercialisation: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/

\* All IP will remain owned by myself, but source will be released under an open source license. Cardano source code is generally Apache v2... but there are other choices: https://choosealicense.com/ (MIT isn't bad for the very commercial space... GPLv3 if you are super ""public good ftw!"")

\* If you are feeling particularly altruistic: All IP will be transferred under the ownership of the Cardano Foundation, to be released (or not) under a license of their choice.

\*\*METRICS\*\*

\*) How are you going to measure success?

\*) Can you measure 'degrees' of success realistically?

\*\*RESEARCH\*\*

\*) Your proposal looks fairly exploratory. How much research have you done to be sure it will work?

\*) Would you be prepared to break up milestones and include a research phase at the beginning before funding is unlocked for later stages? Please include details on costs here.

\*) Who is this a problem for? Have you identified \*specific\* users or groups that are currently waiting for a solution like yours? You have stated a goal of 100 charities in 6 months. How many have you contacted to gauge interest in the idea?

\*\*GENERAL\*\*

\*) Staking has been referenced several times in fairly vague ways. It could be made clearer who is the legal owner of different wallets. This has considerable implication for taxation law with regards to staking, which I haven't seen unpacked at all. Plus tax deductable donations fall into a similar problem space.

\*) Rewards for staking and stake pools fees that SPOs might earn are also confusingly intermingled. Considerable clarity in the writing needs to be introduced.

\*) Will 'FOX Funds' be operating as an SPO as well? This also isn't clear to me. Sometimes it reads more like a network that SPOs can join which try to pair up charitable delegators with SPOs.

\*) If the last point is your position, I guess I am trying to tease out whether you are operator a wallet per customer internally or just going off some sort of fluid internal accounting model?

\*) Do _all_ staking rewards go to charities? You mention ""The owner of the project initially owns 100% of the ownership rights - this means they are entitled to 100% of the market rewards.""... what does 'initially' mean? Is your goal to reach critical mass, then derive a revenue stream from the donations passing through the system? What sort of percentage?",NO
26/Sep/20 3:48 AM,322286,1499,Greg Pendlebury,"@stephen  Ah, that would be my mis-reading. Certainly improves some of the financials.",NO
26/Sep/20 3:37 AM,322239,1475,Greg Pendlebury,"@bigpey  My point was your statement:  
""***If the funding is approved and Charles Hoskinson matches it as originally stated it will fund 52 episodes***""

  
So this proposal from the Treasury is half your assumed funding. If Charles does not make good on that pledge, what would you deliver?

To be clear is seems wildly improbable to me that Charles would back down from the public statement like that, but risk management is about separating ""How likely?"" from ""If it happens..."" and then deciding if the risk is worth taking.",NO
26/Sep/20 3:34 AM,322286,1499,Stephen Cameron,"@greg.pendlebury  this is wonderful and challenging feedback. There is a lot of room within the proposal to ""trim the fat"" and I will address the points you made accordingly! A quick point of clarity, the budget amounts are all in USD but all can be slashed significantly to get to a raw mvp of this.",NO
26/Sep/20 3:23 AM,322798,1623,anthony,"I think helping small business is a good idea, just not yet... we have 500+ small pool operators that have not minted a block... essentially, they are all out of business right now. They are all reaching in their own pocket to stay alive and some, unfortunately, have had to go out of business. Helping other business is a good idea, but our own need help right now. Once Cardano is up and running at full steam, i would back your idea. just not yet...",NO
26/Sep/20 3:18 AM,322286,1499,Greg Pendlebury,"""Once approved by PYNE, a new SAP will make a one-time payment of $???? USD or ADA equivalent in exchange for listing services and ongoing support within the marketplace. SAP's will also be required to pay 10% of all staking rewards earned by SAP and not paid out to delegators or 15% if PYNE is managing the stakepool operations.""

Obviously there is a missing value there ('$???? USD'), but it seems that this is above and beyond the SPOs actual pledge finances. Overall, this just reads like pitch at making an SPO network which skims off the top. Or an offer to run pools for people in exchange for 5% of their profits... on top of skimming the other margin. These margins will be huge, given the ""high ""external"" non-myopic desirability"".

It read super-scammy right now. I think you could considerable improve the optics of all of this by substantiating the other issues noted below. I could see how this would work and then the market can decide if the margins are appropriate or not.

What value do you bring to the table for startup that justifies them paying these fees? Couldn't they do the same thing on their own?

\=======

I have a cheat sheet of tips and advice I have been building during the review process. Some of it looks a bit pro-forma, but I paste my base template at the start of a review and then cut and curate during the review of an idea. I try to include various examples to help you flesh out missing sections.

Please take a look at supporting documentation for the Catalyst process, particularly this document:

\* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oE_cnP0gksdAanXV4w5DYaDNp_tbYEvyHhTUG4HYZ3Q/edit?ts=5f4ffe33

Remember there's a timeline for the proposal process, so don't feel pressure to flesh everything out completely right now, but you want to have refined this before voting starts obviously.

Relevant to this idea:

\*\*COSTS\*\*

\*) What is the basis for your costings? You appear to have used ADA costs at USD 8c.

\*) You are hiring a ""Full time position for development of and future management of stakepools, PYNE website"" at US$320 a month? Full time where?

\*) DevOps contractor PLUS infrastructure costs are half that at US$160 a month.

\*) I touch on legals below.

\*) I didn't look too much more into costs... they seem really off for me on a global project... but perhaps you are targetting emerging economies? Could you please unpack how this will work?

\*\*RISK\*\*

\*) Please include/expand a risk assessment area. Even something basic like:

\* ""my assumptions about external funding (as per blah) may not emerge, which would result in ...""

\* ""if a family crisis happens and I don't have as much time as I thought ...""

\* ""if I unexpectedly lose access to a critical team member during the project my backup plan is ...""

\* ""turns out this was more complicated than I thought... I have broken the work up this way to validate...""

\* In this proposal in particular, I would like to see an exploration of the risk for SPOs... since it seems to be not only the basis of the core proposal, but also what you are suggesting to advise other businesses to build on top of.

\* There is basically no coverage on how OFC will function in the law. They are either contracts, under contract law... in which jurisdiction? In which case you are going to want to bridge the divide and bring people off-chain to contract with... or they need to built into the protocol. Given how random a startup will be (i.e. I assume you are not limiting it to crypto or even Cardano startups) I can only really see contract law working.

\* What about delegators that randomly wander in and delegate? Does this expose startups (or PYNE?) to legal liabiliry of a law suit at a later date when people realise they could have got some shares?

\* ""After a SAP is created and made public, users will be able to delegate to the pool. This is not an investment in the company and delegating in this manner does not violate any SEC regulations currently in place, to the best of our knowledge."" <== This is huge and needs to be explored much more thoroughly. It has crushed some projects in the crypto space. You focus on delegation with that statement, but don't go near OFC and SEC risks.

\*\*PROVENANCE\*\*

\*) Could you expand on the team? An how can voters can confirm the truth of their experience?

e.g. If you are linking to your github or linkedin profiles, perhaps put a reference there that you can also put in your proposal? Or just link back to your proposal from there?

\*\*SCOPE\*\*

\*) If you want to reference other background issues and long term vision, please add a section on scope to rule things 'in' and 'out' for this particular release of funds.

\*) You have mentioned ""Secure marketing partnership with either IOHK, Emurgo or Cardano Foundation"" within 3 months. Have you already discussed this with them?

\*\*MILESTONES\*\*

\*) Have you thought about how funding might be released in tranches? What cadence would work for you? What sort of reports or deliverables are you able to provide to stakeholders? e.g. You indicate 10 SAPs in the pipeline within 6 months.

\*) Would you expose the legals before funding was released? Or will funding be used to draft legals?

\*\*IP/Copyright\*\*

\*) Intellectual Property (IP) hasn't been address in this proposal. I assume all IP and licensing will remain vested with you? The outcome of this proposal will be a service for the community? Or a private business that will retain all profits?

\*\*EXPERIENCE\*\*

\*) I can see you've expressed the problem, but can you expand on why \*you\*/your team are a good pick to solve it? Sell on some experience... background... maybe what makes you passionate about this?

\*) Am particularly keen to hear about the legals. You assertion that draft legals will be ready in 30 days seems unrealistic given the complexity of the on/off chain nature of OFCs... unless you are a lawyer yourself and have already done substantial work in this space? Or have a lawyer in the group? I could see outside counsel eating every ADA in the proposal, but you have only got a legal budget of 1,200 ADA for the first month... (US$96 using your own 8c fiat conversion).

\*) Then you propse to launch the site and have on chain contracts complete within 2 months. Frankly I don't even believe this is possible, but please proove me wrong with some more details.

\*\*METRICS\*\*

\*) How are you going to measure success?

\*) Can you measure 'degrees' of success realistically?

\*\*RESEARCH\*\*

\*) Your proposal looks fairly exploratory. How much research have you done to be sure it will work?

\*) Would you be prepared to break up milestones and include a research phase at the beginning before funding is unlocked for later stages? Please include details on costs here.

\*) Who is this a problem for? Have you identified \*specific\* users or groups that are currently waiting for a solution like yours?

\*\*GENERAL\*\*

\*) ""SAP's will be governed loosely by""... what does this mean? And how will you 'govern' them?

\*) ""The resources needed to create and fund the first round of SAP's is minimal and results are achievable within a short period of time."" What is the evidenciary basis for this statement?

\*) ""Stakepools are already functioning well"" What is your definition for functioning well? I would _mostly_ agree with this when talking about the technology. As a business though, the jury seems to still be out.

Do you understand that Compound cTokens and Aave aTokens use \*the literal exact same\* mechanism to provide derivative tokens that represent underlying assets deposited into a money market earning interest. You should re read our Whitepaper after you learn how derivative tokens work today.

You are quoting the whitepaper I wrote but you have yet to make a single factual point on where the Whitepaper or the proposed design is wrong. Believe it or not not only did I read every internal version of the Whitepaper I wrote all of our Project Advisors, development and integration partners, as well as members of the teams whose protocol's we are building upon read it to. Your moot scenario would seem just as confusing to them (or anyone else) who understands derivative tokens. You can insult me all day mate I am a consultant by day used to taking basic unsophisticated insults from clients. You should at least present a rational argument backed by precedence on existing DeFi protocols \*we use the exact same deriv token design as\* before you insult our entire team with a slight like that.

You are conflating the process of depositing native assets like ADA with minting the derivative representing the underlying+ interest qTokenADA and then later redeeming this for the native asset + accrued interest. You should do some basic research on the existing DeFi protocols and the process of minting/redeeming the derivative tokens, our proposed design in the Whitepaper you like quoting follows this exact process and is inline with macro economic theory on interest rates.

I don't think it can just be delegated without whoever owns it, approving the delegation... But you bring up some good points... first of all, why is there so much ada not being delegated? whoever owns it is loosing money by not delegating it and there is 0 chance that it can be stolen or lost with the way delegation works with ada. One idea that some pool holders have, which kinda goes along with part of what you are suggesting, is to have an option for Daedalus to automatically delegate to the pools OR you able to pick your own pool. That would be fair, help all the pools but still keep the pools that have cultivated a following happy because they wouldn't loose any delegators.

Thanks for the interest in the projects submitted and for the nudges on providing proposal details.

In order to submit ideas to the challenge, our initial thoughts were to outline a few ideas with videos and then see where the community would show initial interest.

We would then funnel-down and select the top 2 which would best be in alignment with the challenge and the interest of the community.

It's become clear that this idea is probably best for another later challenge and so this idea will graciously bow-out from the submission process (unless there is a huge spike in interest that comes out of left field)

26/Sep/20 12:12 AM,322338,1517,Liqwid Labs,"@shapiro21  From reading your comment it's clear you are misunderstanding how ADA as a native asset works in Liqwid markets for deposits compared to interest-accruing qADA tokens that users mint upon depositing ADA.

qTokens are a back-end unit of account for Liqwid Protocol. When a user deposits assets into Liqwid Protocol, qTokens are used to keep track of the user's \*deposited balance\* plus any interest earned.

Each time a user deposits ADA to the Liqwid ADA pool, they are issued a corresponding balance in qTokens. This balance of qTokens is directly proportional to the stake they have in the lending pool, which accrues interest every block (Interest is accrued annually and accounted for every block).

A ""double deposit"" as you phrased it is 100% impossible in our protocol and I will use a simple Liqwid borrow example to highlight this:

Let's say you have 10,000 ADA and you want to become a borrower in the Liqwid ADA pool.

1\. In order to borrow crypto from Liqwid, users need to first supply another type of crypto as collateral, in this example it's ADA, it could also be ETH, USDT (and even user's onchain credit in our protocol). This is provided using the exact same mint function used for supplying assets. Supplied collateral assets ~ADA earn interest while in the protocol, but users CANNOT redeem or transfer collateral while it is securing an open borrowing position. This is why collateral \*in Liqwid\* is never the derivative qToken for a given pool, but rather the underlying assets user's deposit (lock in the pool to earn interest).

2\. The max any user can borrow is limited by the collateral limiter based on the assets they have supplied. In our example this user supplied 10k ADA and if the posted collateral limit for ADA is 75% then the user can borrow at most 7.5k AdA from the pool

3\. The user's Liqwid Borrow balance equals the sum of the user's current borrow balance + amount to be repaid(interest). This is calculated with an simple function built into each qToken contract.

4\. Lastly the Liqwid pool's borrow rate means Liqwid borrowers owe the algo-adjusted interest rate of the asset they are borrowing(ADA here). Liqwid will calculate this value by adding the borrow rate to the Liqwid user account's borrow account balance every Cardano block. While a borrow is open, the Liqwid user's borrow balance is ever-increasing. The borrow and interest is never required to be repaid unless the borrower becomes insolvent; otherwise, the borrower can choose to repay some or all of their borrow whenever they choose.

I hope this short example helps further highlight the flaws in your scenario's logic.

Your ""double deposit"" scenario makes 0 logic to anyone who has every used the Compound Finance or Aave Ethereum DeFi protocols and the attached photo showing the exchange rate of cUSDT (cTokens) to USDT perfectly illustrates how impractical the scenario you highlight above is in the real world. Your scenario also completely ignores basic economic concepts like the time value of money which DeFi money market protocols (Compound, Liqwid) are based upon.

From the first sentence of your scenario you are completely incorrect - >""Imagine a scenario where Alice, Bob, and John deposit 100,000 ADA each into the one and only liquid pool at an exchange rate of 1 ADA per 1 qToken (to keep things simple)""

Your assumption you could ever mint 1:1 underlying to the derivative token is false and completely ignores basic economic concepts like time-value of money. For this reason alone your scenario would never take place in the real world. The entire point of the derivative token is to represent the time-value of \*money\* (underlying ADA) accruing interest to the user's Liqwid balance \*over time\*. Your scenario completely ignores the variable of time which us why you will never have a 1:1 exchange of the Liqwid market asset (ADA) to the derivative token qADA. That would negate the entire concept of accruing interest over time and is the complete opposite of how current DeFi protocols on Ethereum work today. That's why I'm genuinely asking if you understand derivatives as a concept in traditional finance and more importantly derivative tokens current implementations on Ethereum DeFi protocols. Please see the attached image and come back with a realistic example we can have a logical discussion around.

Liqwid qTokens \*represent\* a user's balance + the accruing interest. The user's Liqwid balance \*represented\* as qTokens are what they are using as collateral to borrow on Liqwid markets, you would use the native asset balance (ADA in this example) to deposit into a market and then initiate a loan using the Liqwid account balance. The representation of this balance is qADA that rise in value representing accrued interest overtime. Please explain what about this concept is not clear.

If this scenario was not already impractical you further highlight your fundamental misunderstanding of the ownership/trading of Liqwid qTokens with your 3rd sentence in paragraph 1 ->""Now imagine Sarah manages to acquire 20,000 qTokens through business which she decides to use to take out a loan""

You again make assumptions that fail to consider the basic financial concepts that Liqwid (and any onchain money market protocol) depend on. Specifically when a user exchanges their qTokens, they are also exchanging their corresponding stake in the Liqwid ADA pool. So the question becomes which one of the users in your scenario gave away their qADA (and in the process their underlying ADA + future interest) and why did you not update their balance to show this transfer of ownership. This is what happens in reality again highlighting why your double-deposit point is totally moot.

To your second point: You are completely ignoring the quite real financial cost of getting liquidated. The incentives borrower's have to keep loans in good health and avoid liquidation are at the core, tied to them not wanting to lose their collateral asset (or in the case of user's borrowing with credit being penalized).

In real world examples: 1.Anyone who owns a home and pays their mortgage on time to avoid foreclosure understands how powerful the incentives to keep their loan in good health versus allowing it to slip into default and have the bank foreclose their home. Incentives are powerful and in this case it's actually very simple to recreate these incentives in crypto.. How? You use the same incentives borrower's have to keep up with loans to pay liquidators (a premium) to buy assets at a discount when the borrower's loan becomes unstable. There are quite literally a dozen different examples on Ethereum today for DeFi trading/lending platforms that use crypto incentives and open API's to let liquidators (earn profit) while also securing the protocol against unhealthy loans.

2\. Anyone who has racked up bad credit over time by not repaying debt and now can never use their credit for basics like accessing attractive mortgage rates to purchase a home or auto loans to buy a car.

Thanks for the questions.

The integration we propose would make ADA available for not just ourselves but also other Bitcoin ATM operators around the world. There are over 3000 general bytes machines so potentially all could support Ada. Of course, it's up to the individual operators what cryptocurrency they want to add but the option would be there.

Coinatmradar is the best source of information and stats relating to Bitcoin ATMs: https://coinatmradar.com

Regarding budget allocation, we plan to spend the money on integrating an existing Cardano hot wallet ( such as Adalite). In discussions at the moment for a more accurate estimate of the effort.

We had a call with some of the guys at IOHK and General Bytes for advice and we have a good idea what the requirements are now.

Thanks for your comment.

To be successful, we need:

1/ the cardano community to be involved. Ideas:

Cardano Foundation support and communication channels

Cooperate with stake pool operators - especially small ones, to dedicate parts of their rewards to this initiative in return for greater promotion of their pool.

Incentives ADA holders to donate a portion of their staking rewards

  

2/ successfully identify genuine business that need help. Ideas

I suppose we begin at the local level. Focus on one city/region. It has a greater impact when resources are focussed on the success of one area. It is also easier to facilitate identification at the local level. Working with and though business associations are efficient ways to identify how we can help.  

Concentrate on areas open to blockchain adoption.

  

3/ onboarding their Identity into ecosystem

25/Sep/20 10:15 PM,322338,1517,shapiro21,"Your whitepaper is a good start. I think it is missing two things.

1) Imagine a scenario where Alice, Bob, and John deposit 100,000 ADA each into the one and only liquid pool at an exchange rate of 1 ADA per 1 qToken (to keep things simple). So the liquid pool has 300,000 ADA and each person has 100,000 qTokens, for a total of 300,000 qTokens, which they use in the markets. Now imagine Sarah manages to acquire 20,000 qTokens through business which she decides to use to take out a loan. So she places the 20,000 qTokens as collateral for 20,000 ADA. The pot now has 280,000 ADA. Sarah has no problem keeping up with the interest payments. She then uses the 20,000 ADA to buy a desk chair from Mike. Mike then turns around and decides to deposit the ADA into the liquid pool. He deposits the 20,000 ADA in exchange for 20,000 qTokens.

The problem here is the 20,000 ADA has now been ""double deposited."" The pot is still 300,000 ADA but now there are 320,000 qTokens in circulation. If borrowed assets get ""double deposited"" faster than the interest can get paid, qTokens will inflate away. This literally happened to banks in the 1700s and 1800s.

For those that don't know, in those years a bank would allow people to deposit gold into its vault. For every piece of gold stored, one promissory note would be printed that could be exchanged for a piece of gold from its vault at any time. These promissory notes were also used in the markets as stand-ins for the stored gold pieces. The problem arose when the bank lent out the stored gold to earn a profit from the interests. When the borrower spent the gold in the market, the new owner would then deposit the gold back at the bank. The bank wouldn't know that the gold piece originated from its vault and would print another promissory note. Now there would be 2 promissory notes laying claim to the same piece of gold. Typically, a bank would only last 5-10 years before accidentally inflating away its promissory notes and collapsing. This still happens with the shadow banking system and not only has this contributed to the US dollar losing 90% of its value over the past century but it also played a major role in the 2008 derivatives crisis.

You guys might be able to use blockchain to track whether a specific coin has already been deposited in one of the liquid pools and then just program the protocol so that this doesn't happen.

2) The other thing is you guys don't have a penalty for borrowers who don't pay back the loan at all. For example, this time imagine Sarah is malicious and uses the 20,000 qTokens she acquired to take out a loan of 20,000 ADA. She has no intention of paying it back. Her qToken collateral is eventually completely liquidated and her credit score takes a hit.

The only thing the credit score impacts is the interest rate according to your protocol. That means there is nothing stopping her from doing it again. She will always be ""approved"" for a loan of the same value as her posted collateral. The interest charged just gets higher which means her collateral just gets liquidated faster and faster. She still successfully converts her qTokens for assets at a 1 to 1 value and walks away.

People are actually incentivized to keep the borrowed asset if the asset dramatically increases in value. You can dis-incentivize this by imposing a penalty every time a borrower's collateral gets completely liquidated: maybe they can't take out another loan for a year or maybe next time they can only take out half the value of their collateral.",NO
25/Sep/20 9:59 PM,322241,1477,Rodrigo Pacini,"@skylightpool  What do you mean by making these platforms neutral? Do you disagree with SPOs managing these platforms?

There is a conflict of interest, but I don't think there are enough incentives for some malicious practice to exist. And the transparency of these metrics can be verified by the whole community.

I don't think that SPOs are biased in the content presented in PoolTool or AdaPools. In general, the assessment of pools by the sites is neutral and transparent.",NO
25/Sep/20 9:58 PM,322247,1480,COCO,"@mar001  that's a thing for sure. I think that the developers who want to come to Cardano are already planning on coming to Cardano and are really just waiting to have something to work with. And that's great but that's a small number. If you got every ETH dev to make something for Cardano youve got a few thousand apps. Big deal. We want millions of dApps and the only way to get there is to start from the beginning onboarding new developers.

  

The challenge says nothing about what kind of developers or what kind of apps had to be developed in the 6 months. It just says to encourage development on the Cardano blockchain.

  

Does it matter if that encouragement is 5000 hello world dApps? No, because that's interest and those hello world dApps will become the next DEX before you know it.",NO

25/Sep/20 8:39 PM,322195,1445,James Dunseith,"@daniel.ribar  thanks for this question, I've been thinking about this a lot. It comes down to the nature of Catalyst and an effort I'm making to serve as a model for what I hope Catalyst will become. Although I have not placed this goal front and center, I really want this proposal to serve as an example to future participants: how can you use Catalyst funding and the Catalyst community to start small, learn quickly, and over time grow within this incubator space? What is unique about community-governed Catalyst funding? Why should anyone come here when there other options?

Of course, I'd love to ask for an entire year of funding, but in asking for just two months, I am acknowledging the limited total amount available in Fund2 and my hope that it can support a variety of projects. As I outline in my proposal, I have no proven reputation here yet, and I believe that any of us should have to prove ourselves not by telling a great story, but by demonstrating follow through, and by being held accountable to the Catalyst voting community.

With two months of funding I can fully commit to creating content, conducting research, and developing a reputation so that I can come back in Funds 3, 4, or 5 with both proven work and greater detail for what next steps will entail (and eventually bigger and longer term funding requests). As time goes by, I'll have more clarity on when it's time to expand beyond a team of 1 (hopefully soon!) and the opportunity to adapt, for example, to what I learn via the forthcoming Cardano Development Center, from other projects, or in my own research.

Planning to include a word or two along these lines in a final application and/or in a blog post soon. It would help me to hear if this raises new questions for you or if anything I've mentioned here particularly resonates with you.

25/Sep/20 8:33 PM,322338,1517,Liqwid Labs,"@daniel.ribar  Can you highlight specifically where the proposal is cluttered so we can make clarifications?

If your point is just on requested funds/budget we have not posted any of this info yet so of course you will not see it in the current proposal. We have already had the conversation of budget/timeline with our internal development team and integration partners. To your benchmarking point not only are their requested rates some of the most competitive on market, the team's experience and ability to deliver a best in class Cardano dApp separates this team from the pack. Until we learn more about the specific fund2 cycle length it's pointless to list a budget request that will likely need to be updated. For the same reasons the development schedule and attached Gantt charts are \*\*drafts\*\* pending a final version at the start of the Planning analysis (as we explain in the description).

\\>""I see that fund 2 is for weeks 1-4 stage but I can't figure it out what it will take""

Again I want to caution against trying to draw early conclusions from draft timelines, we have not even released our development team's requested budget yet so a bit early to try to make this draw down. This was surely part of the reasoning behind Dor's comments on the townhall to focus on producing sound problem statements (that actually respond to the fund2 challenge) and establishing your Team's experience/ability to deliver on your proposed solution. We worked on delivering these items for the community to review over sharing the dev team requested budget's at this stage when we don't even know the exact time length (start to end cycle schedule) for fund2.

Our fund2 budget will be released in due time and it will finance the Planning, Analysis and Development task/activities highlighted in the 1st attachment \*for the full length of the fund2 cycle\*. I am not sure where you got ""weeks 1-4 stage"" from to be honest, if it was from the Gantt that's a draft pending hard dates for fund2 start/end.

Our team will take your advice to streamline our information to fewer visuals under consideration. Crypto and finance is complicated enough, we understand this and our aim is to make these concepts as simplified as possible.

At the end of the day users in our application will choose borrow or lend, the visuals describing architecture and design all fade to the backdrop or are accessed by developers/traders who want to build on top/liquidate. We released a whitepaper already. We are working on early technical specifications for developers with our design partners now. Thanks for this feedback mate!

I agree on a set of KPIs to track projects. Looking at the diversity of proposals though, I can't help but think it would be close to impossible to unify them under a single umbrella. Different projects have different priorities and content. These KPIs may have to be quite broad to actually cover every project, which, by extension would mean they become useless.  
  
That said, I am happy to look at concrete examples you may come up with and vote for their adoption if they accurately meet our needs.  
  
1\. On the neutrality: Our credibility means a lot to us, but I don't see running pools as an impediment to providing our services to the community. The platform is open to anyone. The rules are clear and the presentation of facts is verifiably unbiased. Our pools aren't part of the legal entity that runs the platform so there is that separation.

2\. We will use the funds only to improve pooltool.io and the mobile app. We have kept the categories broad enough at this point but can provide a detailed project plan closer to the evaluation stage.

It is rather generic. Doesn't tell me much about how the funds are going to be spent exactly. It is your time, is it additional resources, etc. I think introducing your budget and roadmap would be beneficial.

It's roughly 1000 usd (atm), and while i'm still trying to get a clearer picture on the scope of donations in Gitcoin, this seems fairly reasonable as a demonstration to begin with. I'm hoping we meet some simpler milestones in anticipation of further rounds when Cardano and Voltaire have more liquidity.

  

Edit: just going to amend this comment for now. As I see it, we're looking at a number of projects in the double digits.

The money will be used for travel essentially - with some of the initial funds used to create backdrops, equipment, etc. (One time purchase items). As far as the travel expenses, I am trying to decide if it is better to try and get a full years funding up front or split the funding into 3 month funding blocks and come back to the community 3 additional times to secure the funding on an ongoing basis… In a perfect world I would like to get a fully funded decision on the first ballet but have the money taken out of four different funds as the year progresses with the caveat that the show must be producing results to get the next bit of funding. I don't want to use the communities money on something that is not working and should be accountable through out the process.

If he didn't have access to funds he would be asking for way more ADA so is actually saving treasury money which is a win.

25/Sep/20 4:58 PM,322572,1596,Michael,"@steve.h  Yes, it sounds very assertive, but I am convinced that not only is Cardano is a viable mid cap entity right now (and on that alone it should be considered a partner in incentivized development communities), but our utility advantage is extremely decisive in the current cryptocurrency market when it comes to DeFi and NFT's.

When you say traction, I would opine that the traction that we get for Fund2 be socially inclusive. I'm not really focused on the Solidity/ETH developers per se, but rather the consumer-facing trends that they work with. I'm sure people might argue that some of these trends are juvenile, but I would argue that the most money that can flow into crypto-markets globally will, come from the generation that has barely entered the labor force.

But to bring this back to Cardano's vision. In order to maintain as extensive a social and financial market as possible, our community needs to methodically compete with more centralized visions, and at the same time promote a democratic process. I believe that having a protocol that compartmentalizes the risk to one group can also compartmentalize our DAO as a single source of patronage in the global public (this is where I believe Citcoin should be heavily considered). Presenting ourselves as a bigger, more capable entity can reap dividends in the Cardano culture that we will build before the final DAO.",NO

There is no way to NOT use that unless you want to run a server with your own database. IF you want to run an online store and control the entire infrastructure, with your own database (so, decentralized somewhat as you are in control of everything) you STILL won't be able to use a dApp. Many users/corporations WANT to change their data. They also don't want it to be publicly accessible.  

The point is: dApps are not a solution for everything. Where they are not, that's when plug-ins can come and do the job for you. I'm NOT targeting dApps with this. I'm targeting the needs of those users whose needs can't be met by dApps and can't be met by existing wallets. Hope this makes sense",NO

I don't want to allocate based on assumptions of functionality, but for starters, I'd like to keep whatever isn't spent in a multisig with other team members so it can contribute passively at least. That being said, I'd ballpark at least 80% (9876 ADA) is going into the Gitcoin donation structure, for two reasons:

We demonstrate successful integration with Gitcoin as an external DAO, and subsequently, we gain exposure as an active partner on more websites with established communities.

We demonstrate goodwill to Gitcoin admin and the OSS community at large. Their mission and our mission are aligned with respect to the promotion of open source software and the distributed web, as well as the intent to show a viable, democratically-evident financial incentive structure.

The other 20% (2469 ADA) would be reserved as a contingency for utility costs on the Cardano network, except where it concerns our milestones and their completion.

I do not see why bigpey can't ask people to delegate to his pool for funding this. If i delegate to bigpey, i could support him at no cost to me or anyone else. He gets funding, we get his content, and the treasury funds are left to others: it is a win-win-win.

If he gets perpetual funding from the treasury instead, he gets the funding, we get the content, but someone doesn't get the funds from the treasury. It is a win-win-lose.

I am totally fine if he wants to use the $15k to seed the endeavor until he has enough delegators to support his podcast. He didn't say that this is his intention though. Basically my concern is that he seems to be asking for a win-win-lose scenario when a win-win-win scenario actually exists. I may have come across as if I don't want him to get funding.

\*\*COSTS\*\*

\*) Your costs breakdown is either missing or unclear. How did you arrive at this figure?

\*) Staff costs?

\*) Equipment/licensing costs?

\*) External suppliers or contracts?

\*\*PROVENANCE\*\*

\*) There are a few claims here referencing external work. Can you consider how the voters can confirm the truth of this?

e.g. If you are linking to your github or linkedin profiles, perhaps put a reference there that you can also put in your proposal? Or just link back to your proposal from there?

\*\*SCOPE\*\*

\*) The scope is not clear. You are referencing lots of issues and interests here. Please be specific about the scope of the proposal.

\*) If you want to reference other background issues, codebases etc. please add a section on scope to rule things 'in' and 'out'.

\*) There is also no timeframe given. Is this funding a fixed period of work? Or specific set of features?

\*\*MILESTONES\*\*

\*) Have you thought about how funding might be released in tranches? What cadence would work for you? What sort of reports or deliverables are you able to provide to stakeholders?

\*\*IP/Copyright\*\*

\*) Intellectual Property (IP) hasn't been address in this proposal. I can see Apache v2 present on github... but given the lack of clarity over scope it is hard to be certain what specific artificts are being delivered.

\*\*METRICS\*\*

\*) How are you going to measure success?

\*) Can you measure 'degrees' of success realistically?",NO

Some of it looks a bit pro-forma, but I paste my base template at the start of a review and then cut and curate during the review of an idea. I try to include various examples to help you flesh out missing sections.

Please take a look at supporting documentation for the Catalyst process, particularly this document:

\* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oE_cnP0gksdAanXV4w5DYaDNp_tbYEvyHhTUG4HYZ3Q/edit?ts=5f4ffe33

Remember there's a timeline for the proposal process, so don't feel pressure to flesh everything out completely right now, but you want to have refined this before voting starts obviously.

Relevant to this idea:

\*\*RISK\*\*

\*) Please include/expand a risk assessment area. Even something basic like:

\* ""my assumptions about external funding (as per blah) may not emerge, which would result in ...""

\* ""if a family crisis happens and I don't have as much time as I thought ...""

\* ""if I unexpectedly lose access to a critical team member during the project my backup plan is ...""

\* ""turns out this was more complicated than I thought... I have broken the work up this way to validate...""

\*\*COSTS\*\*

\*) Your costs breakdown is either missing or unclear. How did you arrive at this figure?

\*) Staff costs?

\*) Equipment/licensing costs?

\*) External suppliers or contracts?

I give feedback on the SPO elements towards the end, but you listed it as ""Just an idea"", so I assume you have more details on a non-SPO based approach? What is the planned burn rate for approx US$100k in 6 months for one developer?

\*\*PROVENANCE\*\*

\*) You have referenced external work background. Can you consider how the voters can confirm the truth of this?

e.g. If you are linking to your github or linkedin profiles, perhaps put a reference there that you can also put in your proposal? Or just link back to your proposal from there?

\*\*SCOPE\*\*

\*) How did you arrive at the estimate of ""this project shouldn't take me more than 6 months if I work solo?"". If this app was a genuinely useful software development learning experience (the kind that impacted the Cardano community) it would take an entire team to deliver.

\*) I am happy to be proven wrong... but could you substantiate your claim in any way with professional background or a portfolio of similar work?

\*\*MILESTONES\*\*

\*) Have you thought about how funding might be released in tranches? What cadence would work for you? What sort of reports or deliverables are you able to provide to stakeholders?

\*\*IP/Copyright\*\*

\*) Intellectual Property (IP) hasn't been address in this proposal. Some common options below; these are examples for you:

\* All IP and licensing will remain vested with me. The outcome of this proposal will be a service for the community.

\* All IP will remain owned by myself, but creative outputs will be released under a relevant Creative Commons license (insert here). CC has various options which consider stances on things like attribution and commercialisation: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/

\* All IP will remain owned by myself, but source will be released under an open source license. Cardano source code is generally Apache v2... but there are other choices: https://choosealicense.com/ (MIT isn't bad for the very commercial space... GPLv3 if you are super ""public good ftw!"")

\* If you are feeling particularly altruistic: All IP will be transferred under the ownership of the Cardano Foundation, to be released (or not) under a license of their choice.

\*\*METRICS\*\*

\*) How are you going to measure success?

\*) Can you measure 'degrees' of success realistically?

\*\*RESEARCH\*\*

\*) Your proposal looks fairly exploratory. How much research have you done to be sure it will work?

\*) Would you be prepared to break up milestones and include a research phase at the beginning before funding is unlocked for later stages? Please include details on costs here.

\*) You have stated: ""Eventually this app is meant to be self-sustainable and even profitable.""... but how would you make money using this dApp? What are the platform partnerships you mention? Have you checked if there is interest in the sector?

\*) You dApp premise seems to culminate in ""Gained Programming Experience metrics system which, logged on the blockchain, which will be implicitly monetizable""... it seems to me that this would only be valuable if was broadly used... kind of like a decentralised accreditation? But it is an educational app for non-experts. How would an expert be incentivised to spend time in the app to accrue these metrics? If experts don't use it, wouldn't it just be sign that you took your training wheels off?

\*\*GENERAL\*\*

\*) Care to comment on how the emerging developer portal is likely to impact this proposal? https://forum.cardano.org/t/a-first-look-at-the-cardano-developer-portal/40544

\*) ""setup of a staking pool dedicated towards long-term funding of this project""... my advice is this will be seen as a negative for many. This proposal currently reads like a request to get 1 Million ADA to stake with. You are then suggesting that 5% APY (approx. US$5k per year) on the staking... OR some unknown other number if you become an SPO will be enough to sustain the software development process.

\*) If you really, really want to have to community fund your stake pool, perhaps you should be demonstrating DevOps experience and a costing plan to do all of this securely and indicate what kind of profit margins you are expecting to then route into the development process. How much time will it take before you are up and running? How will you secure sufficient delegators to ensure profitability of your pool?",NO

Here are some recent adverts that were played on the stadium LED whilst the match was in progress. They were seen by millions of football fans and last either 10, 15 or 30 seconds.

Consider these comments as a constructive feedback. I have no interest in your project failing or anything similar. This is an incubator where you can salvage and get perspective from different angles. That's a good thing.

I don't need to do any favours, I didn't claim I am building something of your magnitude. However, you are asking not for a small amount of money and this helps make your request more credible. Isn't that what you are after? Be as credible as possible so that you can elevate your efforts and build some amazing stuff.

Don't get distracted in personal anecdotes. Focus on your goal instead. Don't wait for others to get their proposal in order - I agree - many here don't have minimal viable information available to make good judgement call. That is an opportunity for someone like you to capitalise on.

Hi.

First of all, let me assure you this is NOT how to communicate professionally. You come here and ask for funds and feedback. It would take a bit of humility shown and not personal attacks. Purely based on this I would not be interested.

So moving on - I accept my mistake - I just realised that some version of fund break down is included - BUT in video. It would be helpful to have that in your text version above. Or some disclaimer sending you to that piece of information into video.

However, it doesn't really say anything how these funds are going to be spent specifically. This has a good potential as an idea but you need to give it some firm legs to stand upon first. As a potential interested party - I need to be able to understand how the funds are going to be spent and where we can measure success. What metrics will be used and what determines if this is success or not.

  

My Civic comment was to better understand the concept and if it is something similar or even better.

I really don't understand your frustration.

Few issues though - the proposal is somewhat cluttered. It could be just me but I couldn't find how much funds you need and how these funds are going to be allocated.

On another hand - this was probably the most worked through proposal I've seen so far - so I'll give you kudos for that.

I would only streamline the information on few visuals as they can be little overwhelming at times. You're trying to fit as much info as possible. Dilute down the key basics and separate them by a theme. Aka - this is business proposal - this is technical proposal - etc.

BUT - you need to tweak out financials. I have no idea how to benchmark this project and against what values. You'll polish that out to make us understand - it has a very good ground to stand on.

Good stuff. As you know, I have pushed some evaluation of all tracking tools out there and there seems to be lack of standardisation across all platforms. Depending on your luck, whichever web you find guides your further steps. Further, these are then likely to be spread onto other members of community. Then - we have clashes of various thought groups - seemingly all wanting the same but relying on different set of metrics.

Having said that - I believe the best approach would be to make these platforms neutral. Ecosystem neutral. Such a move would boost credibility substantially. I understand that prior experience and being an SPO helps a lot. But there is a need to divorce these two activities in order to be effectively neutral. To be truly impartial in presentation of facts. From inside but also from outside looking in. Or at least give it a consideration of sorts.

I second the question above - are funds going to be used for the pooltool.io functionality solely or also for additional tools? It would be helpful to see what portion of funds you expect to be allocated towards the numbered list or specific tasks/goals.

When looking at the numbered plan - I believe pooltool.io already has some sorts of 1, 2, 4, etc. I would like to see more scrutiny on specifics as these seem too broad of categories in some ways.

I see a usable wallet not as one that runs a full node and processes all transactions, but as a lightweight private key manager and tx signer. Dapp can use your public key to query all past transactions and generate any report you want. You don't pay fees to read data. Dapp can ask you to sign a tx and transmit it to the network.

I can give you an example: Argent ethereum wallet has some defi products built-in, but it will never catch up with all available defi products accessible in their own dapps. Argent can connect to these external dapps with Wallet Connect. If Argent offered external plugins, not many companies would invest in building an integration with just one wallet.

Much cheaper than a wire. I currently send money abroad using OFX. What's nice about them is they withdraw the funds from my bank account and a week later it's in my account in South Africa or one of my family members. They withdraw the funds in the same way auto payments are done with cell phone bill. The problems with OFX service are that it takes a week and the exchange rate could be better. Using the best parts of the traditional banking system that exist already with the best part about blockchain is what a remittance/ international payments app needs to be. Telcoin looks like it is trying to get there but it would be nice if there was an all inclusive app that avoided having to use exchanges and expensive on off ramps,NO

Great question! :+1:

Personally, I am more interested in making sure we have a good system in place that funds proposals which help ADA increase in value relative to things like USD or BTC. So you could say I am not truly addressing the problem statement that IOHK have created.

However, If I had to answer your question, it would be this -

If we have funds leaking out into weak proposals due to a flawed system design, then how are we going fund quality proposals that truly ""encourage DEVs and Dapps to be built on Cardano"" in a way that creates value for ADA holders?

Funding proposals means that ADA gets sold off into fiat currencies which increases the sell side pressure on Cardano. When the price goes up (through funding quality proposals), it garners attention similar to the parabolic rise of Bitcoin & Ethereum in 2017 which pulled in all the finance guys like myself into the space to investigate.

Currently, there is little to no incentive to be on ideascale conducting due diligence on every proposal, especially by people with the necessary skills/experience who can do a good job.

It's literally to kickstart the project, we can't place a single machine without it (unless I get help elsewhere).  

There will need to be fees to pay the hosts of the machines, but as I'm not being paid it should still work out cheaper for the end user.

24/Sep/20 11:20 PM,322511,1588,anthony,"@shapiro21  to answer your first question, I am not sure. I have a few thoughts… currently a stake pool needs about 2 million in order to consistently average 1 block per epoch. Even with the one to many delegation you still have the issue of delegating to a pool that is going to make blocks for you. unless someone wants to just be nice and slice of a little of their ada to give to a small pool with no realistic expectation of a return, i think you may have the same issue… I don't think it's going to help that much… I really hope I am wrong, but that is my gut feeling. How many people have enough ada to slice off 2 million to somewhat guarantee some kind of return.

You can see the stake pool performance on adapools.org, in fact the video that I attached to the bottom of this proposal has a good look at just that… But I wont bury the lead on you, I looked at the top 40 pools listed by ROI and they were all small pools except for one… It's early but it seems smaller pools have a better chance of a high ROI - but that could change. I have 2.6 mil delegated and I am at 6.43% and in about 100th place on the ROI list.last time i checked.

If you pool has a good ROI chances are your pool has a good up-time. If the system tries to mint a block with a pool that is down, that is marked against them - their reliability score suffers But as far as i know, that score is kept in the system. (if there is someone reading this that knows for sure, please let me know with a comment)

Most stake polls have a way you can contact them and you can see what they do with their profits - I know for sure there is one that is using them to create a payment system for cardano and I have heard of people that want to set up one for charity but as far as I know thats not done yet.

One more thing that I find interesting is that it doesn't seem like the percent the pool takes matters much… some pools take 0 percent (now at least) and some take 8+ percent. My pool takes 5 percent and I have a good ROI. It doesn't line up like you might think…Something to keep in mind when your looking at the pools. ROI is calculated after all that is taken out…

Hope I answered most of your questions. Let me know if you have any others..

**Declaración del problema:**

Falta de contenido en Español para el Proyecto Cardano

Proporcionar materiales de video educando y manteniendo informada a la comunidad hispana sobre el proyecto Cardano

  

**Experiencia relevante:**

**Plan detallado (no es necesario) - Rellene aquí cualquier detalle adicional :**

La comunidad hispana Cardano es la segunda en tamaño y está creciendo rápidamente. Sin embargo, aún no se ha publicado ningún contenido oficial en español.

El plan es financiarse y continuar con el trabajo que ya se está haciendo desde hace + 1 de año (transcripción + doblaje + edición + publicación)

Proporcionar a la comunidad hispana materiales educativos relevantes y mantenerla actualizada con las últimas noticias y comunicados del ecosistema Cardano. La mayoría de los contenidos traducidos provienen de los canales de youtube de Charles Hoskinson, IOHK, Emurgo, Fundación Cardano y The Cardano Effect.

La comunidad hispana está formada por +20 países. Proporcionar contenido Cardano en español es relevante no sólo para la comunidad actual, sino también para todos los futuros miembros hispanos que se embarcarán en el ecosistema Cardano, el contenido ya estará disponible para ellos en los años venideros. Hacer una comunidad Cardano hispana más fuerte significa hacer una comunidad Cardano mundial más fuerte.

El total de palabras transcritas en español ya debería estar cerca de un millón, incluso el idioma inglés no tiene este ""activo"". Procesarlas a través de un traductor (como Deepl) podría producir una versión bastante precisa de las transcripciones en otros idiomas (francés, portugués, etc.). Varios otros idiomas podrían producir un resultado similar con un presupuesto y una carga de trabajo significativamente menores basando su trabajo en las transcripciones en español ya disponibles.

**Presupuesto:**

Para que el contenido sea publicado en español, primero se requiere una transcripción, lo cual es por lejos la tarea que más tiempo consume. El promedio actual de palabras transcritas por mes es de alrededor de 85 mil. El presupuesto se basa en 60 mil palabras transcritas por mes, cualquier cantidad por encima de esa cantidad se incluirá en el mismo presupuesto, lo que significa que no se requerirá ningún aumento en el presupuesto.

El presupuesto por palabra es de 0,017 dólares (esto incluye transcripción, doblaje, edición, publicación)

Mensualmente: 60 mil palabras x 0,017 dólares = 1.020 dólares

x 6 meses = 6.120 dólares

**Auditabilidad:**

Todos los materiales de video publicados pueden ser revisados a través de los canales de Youtube y LBRY. Cada video tiene su respectiva transcripción publicada en el Foro Cardano. Se presentará un informe quincenal informando sobre el contenido publicado con el número de palabras transcritas. La duración de los videos depende solemnemente del material original, en promedio, 60 mil palabras traducidas por mes deberían representar alrededor de 375 minutos de video.

\- do you plan to hire a company which will serve as an intermediary key holder in case of death? I am pretty sure you are not because that kind of defeats the purpose, but just to clear it up

**We are not. We will never have intermediary or anything like that. We are 100% decentralized and you are the master of your keys. No one will never ask for the 24 words. And if somebody do so it is a scam. Please report it.**

  

\- OR you are hiring a company that will develop the smart contract? Seems much more likely

**I'm in talk with a company familiar with Cardano, they met Charles in the past. They build hardware and software. I asked them to build a dApp for Android and IOS first. Then Daedalus and Yoroi native version implementation. Waiting for pricing…**

  

\- I do not know real cost of developing this, but 600k ADA seems a little too high? (I may be completely wrong, though, if you can justify the cost, that's great)

  

**We need to build:**

**\- A dApp, Android + IOS**

**\- A Chrome Extension.**

**\- Daedalus version**

**\- Yoroi version**

**\- Marketing and staff salary for 3,6,12 months.**

**All in all I think 50.000 USD is not that much for the amount of work on the board. IMO.**EDITED: Forgot to say that I will get no money from the fund personally.",NO

So the pool is $100. Each month they would draw a winner ($100). Next month they would all again put in $10 each ($100) and draw a winner expect the previous winner was not eligible to win. Next month two winning farmers are not eligible but would still add to the pot until everyone wins. At the end of 10 months, every farmer wins.

Why does it matter? These farmers have supplies that they need to buy but no access to credit. (Even if they do have credit the interest is very high). So they have two choices save $10 a month until they have $100 or play the game and potentially (10%) of having a $100 now. And a 90% chance of having the money sooner than 10 months.",NO

24/Sep/20 5:05 PM,322314,1510,Jeronimo Backes,"@krzysu  I think I might have to improve my description on how plug-ins work: Plug-ins add user interface features and read information from the wallet in order to implement a certain function. They can't be dApps but can certainly help the process to integrate them straight into your wallet.

*   dApps require fees to be paid. Plug-ins don't - why would you want to generate a report from the transactions you already have on your local pc using a dApp?
*   dApps run on the blockchain. Plug-ins don't. Can a dApp generate an excel file?
*   dApps don't have access to your local computer and its resources. Plug-ins do. Can a dapp lock your desktop wallet after 2 minutes without being used? Or translate the wallet text to another language?

**Plug-ins allow the wallet to support multiple functionalities that won't be available through dApps.**

For example, let's say you are a trader and for every profitable trade you make on Binance for example, you want to reserve 30% of the profit to pay taxes later on. You can create a plug-in that takes your binance API keys, captures the information about trades you made on Binance, calculates 30% on top of each trade, then transfers the corresponding ADA amount to your wallet, on your desktop, so the amount can be staked. There is no scenario where a dApp will be even close to be able to enable this.

If you didn't see wallets supporting plug-ins yet maybe it's because no one has thought about it. Also depending on the programming language used and how the software is deployed, it can be almost impossible to deploy this reliably.

I already wrote plug-in oriented software and I know how to do it well, so it can work on multiple platforms without major headaches for either users or developers.

\>> Do you disagree with this paragraph?

Yes, I have to say I do. But beyond disagreeing, I would also maintain it has no relevance, so agreement or disagreement is just noise. I have unpacked below just to civil, but I suspect at this point we may just need to agree to disagree.

\>> ""All I am getting at is that using a stake pool's profits to fund an endeavor is a very viable business plan.""

I am not privy to the business plan in question, so it would only be conjecture. For myself I considered playing as an SPO, but I could not make a quality pool setup appear profitable given the near future ADA prices with a competitive fee rate. Every SPO is going to have to asses what infrastructure costs they have available in their market region and what their risk appetite for redundancies is.

If current SPO's are running any profit at all, I suspect isn't much and they are instead hodl'ing on the hopes of a future payoff. I am not saying I'm right, just that I don't have the data to know.

\>> ""He is lucky that he already has enough of a following to do this.""

Related to above; even dependant on it, but also noting that you don't know the financials beyond any SPO. It might be a partnership with multiple backers.

This is the closest I would come to agreeing, but it assumes there is a privilege in the first place... which I don't, as per above.

Those two projects that were just crowded out do not have $50k funding from outside of the treasury. Which means they can't be start this time around.

In the former example, 6 projects were started for Cardano. In the latter example, only 4 were started due to funds not going to where they were needed most.

24/Sep/20 7:22 AM,322288,1501,Jeronimo Backes,"@joshualmiller87  coinbase is a middleman who charges a % of every sale you make. The funds of your customers are transferred to them, and from there you can finally move them to your wallet if you wish to do so. You have to have a coinbase account, KYC with them, etc. That is everything but decentralized and it also runs in a blackbox you have no control over.

The idea of this integration (and others to come) is to allow you to receive payments from your customer straight into your wallet, with no commissions or fees - it works as if you were receiving money into your bank account, but with everything automated for you. It is open-source and you can even run your own server with the integration connected specifically to your store, so you don't even need to use the official app we're planning to release to the shopify app store. You have full control of your keys and your funds 100% of the time.

As a bonus, if you use the wallet we are building you will be able to see, from inside your wallet, all purchases from your customers. If you sell on others platforms in addition to shopify, and once we add integrations to these, you will be able to see the transactions from customers of these other platforms as well, inside your wallet.

Hope this clarifies.",NO

I don't agree with considering someone's resources from elsewhere in assessing the merit of a project (unless they choose to include them). The project should be considered as a value for money proposition to the Treasury.

It might be fair to ask something like…

""is there a sustainability roadmap for this podcast past the funding period?""… so (for example) the respondent might talk about drawing on an external revenue *after* using the project to assess what the ongoing cost model will be after 52 episodes, after factoring in audience growth and advertising revenue.

  

Which leads to various other questions it would be good to see in the pitch… will these videos be commercialised on one or more platforms? Is there any relevant research on possible ranges of audience uptakes? Would those metrics be exposed to funding bodies at milestones to release further funding?  
No right or wrong answers here, just part of a value for money proposition for reviewers.",NO

24/Sep/20 6:28 AM,322213,1457,nitemagi,"@thewseph  Thanks. I'll check out the article. Part of our thesis, which we've validated in a pilot clinical trial, is that mental health has multiple domains that need to be addressed, and no one thing addresses it. Psychotherapy, for example, improves anxiety symptoms, depression, but doesn't help social quality of life. Other interventions do, though. So we need to integrate all the diverse offerings without trying to reinvent the wheel. So we need to be teaching skills for self-management, as well as leveraging all the existing resources available for the different needs of that person.

The use of tokens is a great way for getting buy in to the ecosystem, to reward pro-healthy behaviors (both for one's own health and positively participating in online forums in ways that help others), and even to be used for governance of the system in terms of ways to improve the needs of the group. We will also be accounting for ""social determinants"" of mental health, from food insecurity to shelter, as this of course affects one's mental health.

We're already far along in discussion with a number of universities to be creating pilot programs, with leads to grow it to 26 universities (minimal) within a couple years.",NO

24/Sep/20 6:06 AM,322213,1457,Matt,"Hi @nitemagi  Compelling idea, indeed. Without getting into all the nitty gritty, I believe I'm thinking in a parallel vein in regards to wellness. My idea isn't posted yet, and is still only an idea (nothing on the ground, yet). I will hopefully get a proposal posted in order to practice pitching it.

Essentially, my idea boils down to this: The ""work"" for achieving enhanced wellbeing is actually done by the individual. My belief is that a true utilitarian wellness market would turn conventional economics upside down. Blockchain / AI / ML are unique in that they provide the opportunity to incentivize pro-health, and pro-social behaviors to support health.

Regarding OOTify, I particularly like the following statement: ""As we unify this ecosystem, we can be using ADA or a new token built on the ADA platform, to potentially reward students for healthier behaviors.""

You might want to check out an article on ""Value Accounting"", which I have come across in the blockchain space that provides some insight into how blockchain projects might account for multidimensional measures of value beyond supply and demand.

Here's what I'm thinking:

\- Just to clarify, in Pilot phase you said: ""Test phase, opening of a permanent center in Nigeria for 15 full-time developers"". These 15 full-time developers would be the students, correct? How many teachers would you need for those 15 students? How hard is for you to find available teachers?

\- Are the 500.000 ADA you mentioned only sufficient for the kick-start? How much would it cost to mantain the infrastructure + teachers for the first year?

\- IMO, you should also quote these approximate expenses in USD, especially when you talk about longer term expenses (when you said 9.5M ADA until 2022).

\- Also, it would be great if the material that's going to be teached is explained a little more. Is plutus going to be teached, or Marlowe, or haskell or all?

I misunderstood the catalyst process then, I thought that week1 would see a selection already done for proposal writing... so I guess we can break it down into benchmark/market study as a first phase, even including a feasibility study of an impact fund platform using cardano and external oracle pools - including identifying existing oracle pools/benchmarking them, and if needed to identify the need to create specific ones.

The openclimate initiative seems to cover the climate aspect (could be supported even further), the energy market seems also to have many options to gather world's data. I am involved in continuous education (quality education SDG) and life science (healthy life and well-being SDG) ventures, so it could make sense to start with this. The issue is that typical existing data will be available at a macro level, but would be difficult to create/automate at a project/venture level for an Oracle - creating the data and automating it would be part of an external service or a pre-requisite for the fund. I would say that it could interest impact funds as measuring & monitoring the impact is an ongoing discussion for each project.(check https://www.impactassets.org/ for reference).

Should we include all areas of impact investment in the market study? or focus on one? What area of impact investment are you the most interested? I am open.

23/Sep/20 5:37 AM,321952,1362,Jared Tomaszewski,"**The Problem**

The great majority of mainstream programmers have spent all their professional lives within the imperative programming languages world.  
On the other hand both Cardano codebase and it's smart contracts programming language Plutus are purely functional programming languages.  
Developing familiarity with functional programming is especially important for imperative programmers because sadly, Haskell is generally viewed to have a very intimidating, steep learning curve.

**Solution**

To attract the wider community of developers to build on top of Cardano, and Cardano itself, it is imperative (pun intended) to help them become familiar with, and eventually reach proficiency in the functional programming paradigm via Haskell/Plutus and at the path of least resistance.

The scope of this project is quite far-reaching, but the initial goal and the subject of this proposal is to develop tools that will encourage imperative programmers to become familiar with functional programming paradigm.

**The Proposal**

I propose to develop an educational dApp aimed at developing proficiency in functional programming in Haskell and Plutus, based on Cardano codebase, documentation and Plutus examples.  
Because of this, successful implementation of this project will require some level of involvement/support from the core Cardano and Plutus developers.  
One positive side effect of this project will be improvements to the Cardano codebase documentation.While certainly helpful, learners will not be required to have any previous programming experience.

Here is a set of this dApp's unique features:  
\- code first  
\- code via interactive games and puzzles (I've already got a whole list of ideas for cool games)  
\- fun and motivating learning (i.e. perceived as relatively low effort with potential high rewards)  
\- (this is one way how games keep players hooked up).  
\- use of all tricks in the book taking advantage of how the human brain learns  
\- acquires knowledge, experience and becomes motivated and incentivized to acquire skills. This includes:

*   time-spaced repetition,
*   self-evaluation,
*   progress tracking
*   setting/reaching own goals
*   collaboration
*   competition / rivalry
*   blockchain rewards - I have come up with a very unique way of rewarding progress and reaching goals on a blockchain and otherwise.

Combination of these features is aimed not only to develop programming skills, but also at developing what we call experience. I am absolutely certain that with the right tools it is possible to learn the experience just as any other knowledge.To this end the app will implement a unique Gained Programming Experience metrics system which, logged on the blockchain, will be implicitly monetizable.

By reaching successive goals the learner will gain more confidence and ability to write high-quality maintainable code. To achieve this the app will make extensive use of Plutus and Cardano code-base and documentation. This way developers will get a chance to not only become excellent Haskell and Plutus programmers, but may become contributors to Cardano code-base and ecosystem.

Ultimately this app in its generalized version will allow anyone to gain excellent programming skills in any programming language, framework or library.

**Cost**

Reaching this initial goal of this project shouldn't take me more than 6 months if I work solo and part-time. This time-frame will naturally shorten if more developers get involved, or/and I can afford to go full-time working on it.

However, please note that eventually this app is meant to be self-sustainable and even profitable. To achieve this I will be seeking mutually beneficial partnerships with other e-learning platforms and other business strategies (blockchain-based, and otherwise).

**Personally...**

As much as for the benefit of Cardano, this is a very much personal Project - all goals of this project are my personal goals as a developer, thus I've got all the motivation and drive to make this project successful. I have many ideas suitable for blockchain and Cardano is my blockchain of choice, as I too believe it is technologically, scientifically and community-wise superior to all others. There is also one idea which explicitly requires blockchain implemented with Haskell.  
For me, this project is but a starting point on my journey through the blockchain.",NO
23/Sep/20 5:06 AM,319227,294,Robert O'Brien,"@yg  I tend to think bottom-up.

  

In terms of thinking about the Fund2 challenge 'Impact Investing financial system' is too broad to fit within the six months objective of the fund2 challenge. It is a wide horizontal endeavour/mission. That is ok and good. What fund2 effort could help us to both learn about the domain/market opportunity, while also engaging with developers and \[social\] entrepreneurs?

IXO started out looking at education outputs and outcomes. On a project, I helped to set-up https://www.calmthefarm.nz/impact-science, we started in the social investment space but ended up focusing on regenerative ag. for a number of reasons. Both projects aimed to solve the data problem first, to make impact investing more accountable, actionable and effective.

To build an IIFS (at least as I think of it ;-)) there will be many different pieces. Pieces that aren't specific to impact investing but can be used to support it i.e. multi-capital accounting. That includes data stores, data oracles, AMM using different curves/surfaces, financial instruments like bonds, options, and ETFs at the backend, that can be used to generate the necessary impact market data and analytics etc.

re: ""oracle marketplace"" ... A bit late to get the votes though.

The last query is an improvement but still a poor showing. To be fair, Ethereum 1.0 greatest strength is, without a doubt, its Developer Ecosystem, and that gives it a massive advantage over Cardano. But it is also maybe it's more prolonged-term weakness as the project tries to move to Ethereum 2.0.

Summary quotes from Pelle Brændgaard's excellent analysis of the Ethereum ecosystem using Wardley Mapping ( see: https://chainstrat.substack.com/p/building-a-working-map-of-ethereum ).

*   Ethereum's greatest strength and primary viral loop.
*   A loyal group of Crypto Investors as a significant yet secondary strength.
*   Its most significant weakness is transaction throughput that directly affects the gas price.
*   Lack of end-users from outside of the ecosystem;
*   When I say from outside the ecosystem, I mean non-developers and non-investors using Ethereum dApps.

A few observations:

1.  A diversity of Developer oriented content needs to be created and optimised for search engines.
2.  Blog articles and how-to guides are just one type of material. Books such as O'Reilly animal books (print and digital via Safari), video tutorials etc. are super important.
3.  The search questions I've used where just OTTOH. They do provide a good starting point to do some more strategic analysis of content and challenges needed to attract developers.

I've pointed to Pelle Brændgaard's excellent analysis above and attached a few of his maps to this perspective. I highlight it again because he is using one of my favourite strategic analysis and communication tool — Wardley Mapping. I think such an analysis from the PoV of Cardano Ecosystem Inc. would be of significant utility. Mapping out Cardano's ecosystem strategy generally and developer adoption strategy in-particular would give more clarity and meaning to the CF Roadmap for instance. Maybe that is a separate idea to work on.

If you are not familiar with the Wardley Mapping approach, then here are a few resources.

Several other people have suggested creating different forms of content for Fund2. I also want to shoutout to all the great stuff the IOG, Emurgo, and CF teams have been producing. The IOG papers and specifications are just gold for someone like me. Still, they are not something that a typical software developer would read.

As the search results above show, the community as a whole needs to step up the range, voice, and distribution of content targeted at Developers.

I don't think this is controversial, but without an ecosystem of developers building on and with Cardano, then the network will slowly die no matter how great the technology is. Developers also need to make a living; hence we need to attract investment, e.g. entrepreneurial activity.

Developers will tend to recommend the technology they are most familiar with or interested in any project they start/join. The first point of call for any developer learning something is via Hackernews, Reddit, Twitter, where links to content/projects of interest are distributed and Stack Overflow to get answers and copy code ;-) But Google (or maybe Duckduckgo) is still the main starting point. Once some tyre-kicking is done, and some general familiarity is developed, books tend to be a more focused source of learning. Then reading lots of code of related projects.

**A proposal:** Build a community-driven curation/funding + collaborative marketplace for driving Developer focused content production & distribution.

*Four things motivate this:*

1.  All the above but with an emphasis on Developers attention is scarce, and they need to make a living too.
2.  We need ongoing content development focused on developers that are distributed via a lot of different channels, formats, and voices.
3.  Engage the wider Cardano community to help curate and produce this content, such as editors, graphic designers, SEO and Social media marketers. e.g. a market place.
4.  Eat our own dog food! There is a recursiveness to this. Cardano wants/needs to get developers on board, there is a strong emphasis on decentralisation and unchain governance. Why not gain experience in all of this to solve two problems we have - real-world use case, attracting developers.",NO

22/Sep/20 6:40 PM,319416,396,Liqwid Labs,"@adamint  Currently 49.7% of circulating ADA is being staked and the network runs great. Liqwid is a non-custodial onchain platform controlled by Cardano smart contracts. In the current protocol architecture and design (which admittedly airs on the side of simplicity/is by design generalized across markets) a Liqwid market has 0 capability to move a user's deposited funds \*outside of the Liqwid market\*. The only actions the smart contract can take are defined by user actions (deposit, borrow against, repay loan, redeem assets, liquidate). Your ? is asking if the protocol will automatically enter a user's deposited ADA into a staking pool and the short answer is no, we don't need to make the protocol more complex to include a feature any user can execute on their own.

There will be several staking derivatives created that allow users to take out loans while their ada remains staked (Cosmos devs are already building this). That's not the point of Liqwid at all. Also ADA will be a single market on the protocol and likely not even the largest volume market (there is significantly higher volumes of supply and demand for stablecoins on the Ethereum money market protocols today). I can't highlight this enough as the difference is not even close on both the supply and demand side the DAI/USDC stablecoin are by in large the most used. I expect the Cardano-DAI equivalent to similarly command a significantly higher supply and demand volume market than the ADA market. The reasons are simple; more people use crypto to escape their hyperinflating currency/traders who want to lock in profits while earning risk-free interest than people who just want to go longer ADA/ETH. You can use derivatives on other higher leverage instruments to do that. That's the difference between a money market and a derivative market in CeFi traditional finance today.

Final point, the example you highlight here user's can do on their own. The protocol does not need to build additional complexity/validation checks for a feature any user can do with a few clicks (e.g. Liqwid would need to validate that a user depositing ADA is not already staking it, then manage both the staking rewards + the earned interest), this is a tradeoff feature we are willing to take at this point in time. At the same time our team is always conducting research and speaking with our development partners on specific feature implementations. If further research or user demand for such an ""auto-stake"" feature for the ADA market arise we are 100% willing to pivot.

22/Sep/20 6:21 PM,319132,237,Ken Stanton,"This is a podcast I listened to a few years ago that's inspired me about providing cheap and effective education (especially the second half of the discussion):

https://hiddenforces.io/podcasts/remaking-the-future-education-in-african-countries-is-crucial-to-our-survival/  

It's possible to greatly improve the quality of education by almost removing the teacher entirely from the process.. think of it as more of a coaching role where the students are the ones playing the game. It's distributed education where you get a more flexible system if you don't have a single individual with centralized control who micromanages the process. What we want is to help students learn to adapt to new situations. Giving a multiple-choice question to a student doesn't give flexibility in how the question is answered, and there may even be limiting problems in the question asking itself. If you give students a problem to solve and access to the material required to team up and solve it, the outcome is better because it reflects the way things are done in the real world.

Reducing the overhead costs and making the system of education scale better is a good step towards the idea of paying students to learn.. if they're learning to provide value to other students and the community at large.. in fact, the model closely resembles the way that this platform we're using now is meant to produce innovative ideas.. maybe monetizing a ""kudos"" system to provide incentive to help other students, and having the community invest funding in school projects that actually improve something in the community.

The simplicity speaks for itself. The benefits of the RINA approach are numerous:

Scalability. The recursive structure scales indefinitely. No more router table size explosion.

Security. Each layer is a securable container, and most of your firewalls, session border controllers and intrusion systems disappear. No more port scanning, much less scope for mischief.

Performance. The overheads of routing are far lower, the algorithms can be implemented simply in silicon.

Manageability. You can swap out protocols and mechanisms at lower layers without upper layers knowing or caring. Reconfigure your data centre whilst it is running!

Flexibility. You can implement any and all QoS mechanisms within the architecture, not just 'best effort', and (if the mechanism supports it) create a composable trading system for allocating resources according to any policy you see fit.

Reliability. Multi-homing goes from being complex to trivial. Reliability is ordinary, not outrageously hard.

Mobility. No more complexity to address mobility as a special case: it falls straight out of the architecture. You can shred a lot of your 3GPP standards, too.

Cost. No more hacks-upon-hacks. This is the minimal 'necessary and sufficient' amount of functionality needed.

However, if you want to look at a Network Resource Planning system that feels like GnuCash then check out Scenorica (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorica). Indeed the very essence of an NRP would be to focus on small micro-enterprises as Haier calls them.

From what I have worked through thus far, I have some quibbles with their business model, architecture and treatment of TEA.

22/Sep/20 12:55 PM,319227,294,Robert O'Brien,"@yg  I'm not familiar with zeri, but I do recall coming across transitionnetwork a while back. Fwiw, I spent a couple of years working in this area. The biggest problem with Impact Investing at that time was a complete lack of reliable data. Acumen has been doing a lot of work to improve this situation with their Lean Data programme (https://acumen.org/lean-data/). The rest of the impact investing space works with mostly window dressing data. That is a little harsh.

  
As an example of a blockchain-based impact investment protocol check out ixo (https://ixo.world/) IXO are structured as a Impact Bond (the term bond means 'pay-for-success' or 'pay-for-result' contracts rather than financial bonds). Last I looked, the core of the protocol was using a risk-adjusted bonding curve to help finance impact projects. Risk factors being feed in via Oracles. The project is built on cosmos.  
  
Anyway, I humbly suggest that a good starting point for your idea could be with Oracle Pools that look at getting various forms of SDG/Impact Data.

A great way to engage with both the impact problem, climate, oracle pools and developers would be to work in with something like the Yale (https://openlab.yale.edu/) lead Open Climate Collabathon ( https://www.collabathon.openclimate.earth/ ). The world-wide event includes groups from Yale, MIT, and Stanford and SMU (Singapore) and is happening again in November 2020. I loosely participated in some of this last year which included an Ethereum based carbon data project.

22/Sep/20 12:22 PM,319421,400,Robert O'Brien,"I really like the Oracle Pool concept. I have not had a chance to reacquaint myself with progress in oracle implementations recently, so take this all with a big grain-of-salt.

The proposal for oracle pools is both exciting and in keeping with the ExUTXO and the PoS/SPO architecture. Robert's recent 'Unlocking The Potential Of The UTXO Model' describes Data Inputs, building on the pool approach in a compelling way. That is to say:

1\. Oracles, in general, are really important for DeFi.

2\. Other DApp domains will require assurance over data from outside the network.

3\. Oracle Pools are a fantastic concept, they fit into the Cardano Architecture.

In general, I agree with most of the perspectives both @rodrigopacini  and @steve.h  make above. Here is where I take a different path. Oracle Pools are unique and when combined with the SPO as a diversified revenue stream solve a couple of problems.

1\. They also solve a centralisation problem which appears to be endemic to existing Ethereum Oracles.

2\. SPO development provide both decentralisation and diversity.

3\. The inherent diversity means rather than just focusing on on-chain price data, there is also strong potential to integrate with external data.

On that last point, Weather data is super important, but a little difficult to verify without an authoritative source, and or many contributors. Because SPOs are building an on-chain reputation for turning-up to produce blocks, it is logical that the reputation context can also extend to Oracle Pools that SPOs participate in, and govern etc. First-To-Post Oracle Pools & Signed Datapoints, for example, are perfect for weather data. And weather data, for example, can be used in DeFi protocols that help finance crop production in Africa and South-East Asia.

So that is all great, but the framing of the wild-thought doesn't specifically address the Fund2 challenge of attracting developers. Here are a few thoughts…

Ethereum's greatest strength is, without a doubt, its Developer Ecosystem. To use Cardano, Developers will have to learn entirely new tools: Functional programming, Haskell/Plutus, and a UTXO model. Were either attracting developers new to the whole blockchain space, or developers from other ecosystems like Ethereum. I say this as a Software Engineer… developers are a LAZY bunch ;-) I'd prefer to use the tools and languages I already know rather than have to force myself to learn a whole new set of tools. And there have been various ideas to enable porting of Solidity/Vyper or running EVM code.

I think Oracle Pool could be an excellent vehicle to help 'port-over' Ethereum developers. Not by pulling in Ethereum Oracles into Cardano, but rather exporting Oracle Pool data production into API Fee driven Ethereum Oracle space— a low-cost more secure data oracle system used by Ethereum smart-contract developers. This approach does a few things:

1\. Creates a revenue stream for SPO by earning cross-chain data export revenue (e.g. earning ETH).

2\. Provides work code examples — developers love code/example projects to learn from.

3\. Through use it exposes then to the ExUTXO model of smart-contract development.

That last point is similar to trying to get developers to learn functional programming. The motivation needs to be high for that to happen.

Finally, to @rodrigopacini  point about research on the governance side of Oracle Pools; doing some token engineering with cadCAD (cadCAD.org) would be a great project. If I get a chance tomorrow, I'll put up an idea to expand on this.",NO

22/Sep/20 3:37 AM,321608,1239,scottcampbell,"A short fable for the above idea...

  

  

A clinical diagnostic study is proposed between private corporations, publicly and privately funded research organisations, and a public hospital.

It has grand aims; the development of a novel rapid diagnostic test for Sepsis. Such a test would be ground-breaking; it would give the clinician the ability to see if the pathogen causing the potentially fatal infection was resistant to the drug, and the extent to which the pathogen had taken hold in the patient. With the rise of antimicrobial resistance, this remains to be a need for hospitals worldwide.

Despite the difficulty of the task, the team is qualified to meet the challenge; it has several former professors from academic institutions, highly regarded medical professionals, young postdocs hungry to make their mark, and importantly, decent funding. The study will be a collaboration. The private company brings their IP and diagnostic technology, the medical research organisations brings their expertise, the public hospital provides the samples. A proposal and roadmap is established; based on previous studies and the some innovative ideas, the project appears to be feasible and all parties sign a memorandum of understanding. Happy days.  

Due to the nature of blood and the relatively small amount of biological target, the science is not easy. For the assay to be of use, it would require very precise chemistry and the formation of novel reagents and processes. Equipment may even need to be modified. The perception of the team is that technical issues would be the biggest roadblock to their success... they are wrong.

The first snag occurs when samples from the public hospital are delayed from leaving the building due to ethical concerns. As there are many different parties that will eventually use the samples, an ethics board must approve. This is an understandable process, but does take up several months.

When this issue is fixed, the samples are transported to the medical research organisation, on-route to the private company that has the technology necessary to run the study. Emails are exchange and the samples finally reach the private corporation. The samples are run and the first technical roadblock is found (in essences, the reagents are not concentrated enough, so automation issues with pipetting robots). Additional samples are needed.

The private company reaches out to the medical research organisation for more samples. The head of research at the medical research organisation is shocked - they had the understanding that the samples would be returned so that additional studies would be done on these samples. The emails sent between both parties are reviewed. It is not really clear either way. Other researchers in the organisation had arranged funding on these samples and now they have been consumed. Management of the medical research organisation is not happy, they demand better control over samples, and require more processes before samples are shared with other organisation's. The CEO of the private company is furious - they now have a team of six researchers on the books with no samples to work with. Its costing money. The management of the medical research organisation is also very upset, they need to explain why planned research is not occurring. The clinical doctors who collected the samples are also understandably frustrated; they had spent considerable time preparing the samples.

A further ten months goes by without the samples being transferred from the research organisation to the company. Several angry phone calls are exchanged between the parties of the study. The head of research at the research organisation, believing the CEO is exploiting him, wants to cancel the study. The CEO of the company, concerned with the cost of project, wants to cut loses and focus on core products. The doctors in the hospital, having spent their own time preparing samples, do not believe a return is likely and are now hesitant to participate.

At the same time, the chemists and engineers have made a breakthrough - they just need the samples to test, but the study is ultimately cancelled.

  

  

I believe the blockchain can help the above scenario. Whilst it is correct that legal documents can be formed and signed outlining all points of where, when, and how clinical medical samples can be shared between organisation - its often roadblocks in people and not technology that leads to failures. It's also true that software exists to track the above problem - but it is often expensive and not utilised in new collaborations.

There's a huge amount of potential in human medical samples - we just need better ways to maintain trust and accountability between each other.",NO

https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/QuickBooks-for-Cardano/321119-48088

I write software that writes accounting/database software. Just describe what you want in the data dictionary and run the generator script to build your accounting system. I use this approach because it's a faster way to develop, it enforces consistency, reduces errors, makes it easy to make sweeping changes and fix bugs, improves security, and facilitates the code audit. Different versions with different accounting functionality can be generated.

Unique IDs for every transaction in the system come from a single incremented source and every transaction is fully logged so that you can always examine the database for any point in history.

The accounting system is double entry but with smart contracts it should be possible to have a triple entry system that balances the books between participating governments and businesses.

With cryptocurrency your wallet or accounting system is the bank - if someone hacks your account there is no one you can go to for help. This is a gigantic impediment to mass-adoption for government and enterprise. To clear this impediment, the accounting application I am working on uses no dependencies because external libraries are a huge security risk. The generator and database are written from scratch in plain vanilla JavaScript and the accounting systems produced are written by the code generator - not humans - again, in plain vanilla JavaScript. So if you can prove the generated code for one table in the system is secure then it is easy to prove that the rest of the system is also secure. This should help government and business feel more comfortable about committing to Cardano.

There is no sense in building a secure accounting system if you are going to run it on computers that you can remote into. And any computer that connects to the Internet or to any other device can be controlled remotely. This is why we have built a special airgapped computer to run these systems. The computer can be seen at the link below.

Udemy is a cool platform, but it's a small pond in the mass media universe. Put it up on YT and promote it that way.

Thanks for your clarification but a tipping bot will be used by people or for people that are already in the crypto space. My idea - Tipping people not in the space, who would usually expect fiat, will bring people that are not in the space, into the space... I am talking about face to face tipping for services. In areas like restaurants, etc. Where you would give some one a usb or something where they would have to do a little work to get the tip. The reason you would give them a bigger tip (extra) is for the hassle of learning something new... This is more about bringing people into the space who are not there as opposed to a bot that would need to be used by parties that both where already in the space...

I need a bit more technical background ot understand it all, but I think I understand the balll park. I agree that the accounting part will allow widespread adoption as ""accounting systems rule the world"" as you say. I am not familiar with any existing international standards regarding ""accounting processes"" (thanks for the introduction by the way), but it makes sense to look into it first, as well as UTXO/TEA principles integration, etc.... and ensure the solution can cover it all if possible.

The IFRS vs US GAAP challenge becomes non-existent, just a different facet of the same model. I would argue that a full ERP approach is needed. This would take too much time to market and selling an ERP is different from selling an accounting system. The 2nd one can be easily deployed (for Small & Medium Size business) without the complexity of the all ERP. I would dream of a ""GNUCASH""-like (a bit more userfriendly ;-) compatible with Cardano.

This amounts to researching, simulating and designing a bonding curve AMM protocol that can be used both in a Defi context but also as the primary building blocks for an SDG Multi-capital accounting financial reporting model.

21/Sep/20 11:59 AM,319235,302,Robert O'Brien,"Framing the idea as a **Network Accounting DApp(s)** I think is better, or going a little wider and framing it as a Network Resource Planning (NRP vs ERP) Accounting framework. A set of unifying concepts and interfaces that share suitable Accounting themes. As an illustration of what I'm suggesting; Defi on Ethereum share the semantics of market-price (via on-chain AMMs) and interface standards such as ERC20, 721, 1155 etc. that define the idea of tokens.

What are the unifying **Accounting** themes for the Cardano Ecosystem?

Excuse my somewhat technical comments to sort-of answer that rhetorical question … Some suggestions to themes/concepts:

\- The Extended UTXO model of bookkeeping (often referred to as a type of *Triple-Entry-Accounting*).

\- Couple this with the *Resource-Event-Agent (REA)* accounting ontology, or a *Resource-Service-System (RSS)* ontology which I prefer.

\- Take the perspective of **Ecosystem** and *Value-Network* accounting rather than Enterprise and/or Supply-Chains. REA and RSS do this.

Both REA and RSS are process-oriented perspectives of accounting. They fall naturally into similar conceptual models of the ExUTXO, computer science concurrency process models, event-sourcing, and something I think Philip Wadler expressed— Cardano is a 'Functional' blockchain.

There is a good body of work that looks at the implementation details of Accounting Information Systems (AIS). Value flows https://valueflo.ws/ gives a practical introduction to REA, which btw is an ISO Standard. The work of Tom Hvitved ""Contract formalisation and modular implementation of domain-specific languages"" http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.724.7779&rep=rep1&type=pdf is very relevant. It covers an accounting oriented Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for writing computational contracts, with REA and a process event perspective over transactions, and implements an ERP system in Haskell.

A little context and food-for-thought around my comments…

The vision of Cardano is a financial operating system, with a mission to bring economic identity to those who lack it. Today Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems do this for different types of organisations from governments, banks, and other organisations. In other words, for legal fictions such as companies, some type of economic resource planning system (automated or not) give these entities economic identity. Accounting systems rule the world!

A lot of the activity in public blockchains has focused on money and finance, I believe the real strength of Cardano is in Accounting. That might sound boring, but a lot of effort goes into building various accounting and resource planning systems. Small improvements in AIS construction can pay large societal dividends.

To illustrate a particular feature of Cardano that makes this plausible. No enterprise will want to run their accounting activities on a public blockchain. However, the technically named hard-fork combinator lets Cardano run many different blockchains as if they were one, e.g. Bryon and Shelly co-exist! That also means private, permissioned and public Cardano blockchains could co-exist seamlessly. The hard-fork combinator provides an operating system like abstraction to consensus layers. The same DApp or Smart-Contract will work regardless of network deployment. That drives code reuse and simplifies deployment. In the case of accounting, it would be possible for a completely private Cardano instance (Cardano-as-a-Service via SPO!) to execute accounting rules, e.g. UTXO input combinations, and Smart-Contracts, that are private to an enterprise. With cross-chain coordination/swaps/settlement, it also becomes seamless to interact with others via permissioned or public chains.

I suspect just implementing accounting on a blockchain would give 10x improvement alone to auditing and compliance— it also has implications for impact investing and climate accounting. Charles recently framed Cardano as the 'Governance blockchain' as a way to define Cardano as a 3rd generation blockchain. Accounting is the primary measurement tool for governance. In a nod to Fund 2's Challenge, I'm a software engineer, and that is something I can buy into :-)

It goes a little further than that. Any ERP system is really a customised collection of many 'Apps' that in principle, work together. Different enterprises ERP systems such as SAP, Net Suites, Microsoft Dynamics, among others, automate business processes and record the associated activity. No one installation is the same, but they do orient around some core concepts.

Maybe this is stating the obvious, but at the core of any ERP system is a General Ledger (GL) bookkeeping system based on double-entry accounting principals (DEB). It is the GL that, in principle if not in practice, is the unifying glue to hold these different Apps together. Although the GL account structure is a little broken as a compositional tool, a legacy hang-over.

DEB was initially devised to handle a lack of negative numbers, but today it refers to the broader idea of bookkeeping to track changes in value-stocks, aka. State. Accounts represent the stock of value for an entity. DEB Accounts while easy to understand aren't very composable and don't scale particularly well. Hence there are lots of fixes to make them work for complex reporting needs and to work across trust boundaries.

Kip Twitchell (https://ledgerlearning.com/) digs into the laborious detail if you're interested. The rough summary: accounts a.k.a. balances/reports can be generated on the fly to meet the different measurement/reporting requirements.

Don't aggregate transactions into balances as they occur instead keep all the transactions around and aggregate as needed. As a result, you can do cash or accrual accounting without having to lock that in. Balances are just dynamically generated reports over a graph of interlinked transactions. If you're worried about performance, don't be. With an immutable log of accounting events, many engineering tricks help optimise query time. This leads to a very general claim: DEB GL isn't that great a concept for stitching a network of 'books' together. A DEB GL is however fantastic for reporting the current state of affairs but rather crap at reporting flow and/or momentum of a network. Capture the flows, and derive the stock.

If you see a parallel with the UTXO (Bitcoin) vs Accounts (Ethereum) comparison, you're not alone I suspect the argument does apply. However, the above statement is about AIS design.

At the heart of Cardano is at the ledger. A ledger design based on Triple-Entry (TEA) accounting principles, and a model of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) that track value-flows— a process-oriented view of value transformations! And this makes it more amenable to crossing accounting boundaries.

To cut this comment short: there is a large body of work that looks at process-oriented AIS implementation. TEA, the ExUTXO model, and Plutus-Core are a perfect based for building a process-oriented Network Resource Planning DApp Ecosystem.

Not wanting to propose solutions at this stage ;-) Perhaps for Fund 2, the idea can be to start pulling the threads of accounting research together with the TEA, ExUTXO model to start establishing the essential concepts needed to unify various DApps to account for and build economic identity.

Work could proceed in a similar vein to the Value Flows https://valueflo.ws/ building upon it and later the associated VF GraphQL https://github.com/valueflows/vf-graphql. For example, it could extend Cardano-GraphQL with a Value-Flows model.

This would also heavily complement and extend the fantastic work Robert Kornacki (Emurgo) is doing in attempting to explain the ExUTXO model's potential to developers. See 'Unlocking The Potential Of The UTXO Model' for an example of this.",NO

I've seen a lot of great ideas… and this is one. I just don't think the problem is solved by this proposal…

Edit to ADA: Because of the timeline. I have no issues if you have an open source bot in mind that already exists... If not... It won't occur in 6 months. The other issue is that it needs to be finished and completed in time to drive adoption by the 6 month timeframe... not just be finished in 6 months.

I see your project has many front end venues. Interviews, direct support, and updates; in the back end it has your willingness to help, support, and the fact that uninterruptedly, you have been doing it since mid 2019. You go the extra mile in providing support to your audience, and it shows that you have a clear and transparent Vision.

I would add a weekly or monthly episode dedicated to education from Zero Base Knowledge, about blockchain third generation technology and above, and attract an unique segment: Children and youth. I would be glad to help promote it in Elementary, Middle and High schools, starting with Tequesta Trace Middle School in Weston, Florida, which is my daughters' Middle School, and where I am the PTA president; then following with other schools. Also, I would promote it to be part of Extension Office 4H programming around the country. https://bit.ly/3hL8TJP -mid term goal -. Each county has at least one Extension office. Extension offices mission is disseminate research based information with in the local communities. The research is made at the state land grand Universities https://bit.ly/2RKicz0 . I would promote it within Broward County, University of Florida 4H Extension office, where I seat as Chair for the Advisory Board.

Children need focus. The success in the education of the future will be based on the response to motivation driven from inside out. That means discovering what inspire us, then dedicate undivided attention on it, by investing our time, an irreplaceable and the most valuable commodity there is. Education means adoption, this is just the beginning of a new Era, and It just make sense to pay attention and educate the youngest to ensure the channel's sustainability and scalability.

21/Sep/20 2:41 AM,319918,634,Aidan,"Reducing barrier of entry is a must for further adoption. I have a few ideas as to how we could make it easier for people to buy and hodl ADA.  
  
**1\. Exchange Built into Cardano Based Sites**My first thought would be to have some easy payment portal on the Cardano related websites. Something simple where you just enter in your bank info and then can buy ADA. Maybe it connects to an exchange like Binance in order to source the liquidity. This idea isn't super wild but I think is something people are familiar with due to ecommerce and may have more faith in than having to go through other providers to get their ADA.  
  
**2\. Exchange Built into Cardano Based Wallets**  
My second idea would be to enable users to buy and sell ADA directly in supported wallets such as Daedalus and Yoroi. This would be highly beneficial to SPO and delegators as they could sell the ADA they have been earning from staking or load up some more directly from or into their highly secure wallets. A huge problem with crypto right now is the amount of steps it takes to buy a currency with fiat and then get it into a secure place. If we could do this all from within the wallet we could essentially create a nice peer-to-peer exchange that leaves the traded ADA directly in secure wallets. A cool benefit of all this is that less transactions would occur as you would not need to move ADA to some place like Binance to sell it, creating two transactions. Instead you would only have one. Big problem here is how is someone going to get fiat/crypto into their wallet in the first place. Maybe Cardano can partner up with Caitlin Long to provide a solution. What are your thoughts?  
  
**3\. Stake Pool Delegation Sign on Bonus**

In order to get non ADA hodlers to download things like Daedalus and Yoroi as well as increase decentralization and number of people staking SPO's could start to offer sign on bonuses. SPOs could take a note out of legacy banking and start offering people X amount of ADA if they promise to delegate it and whatever rewards it creates for Y period of time. Could be an interesting way to start forcing stake pools to get a bit more crafty with how they market them selves beyond hardware, saturation, and blocks produced.  
  
**4\. Micro Tip System**  
My last idea would be to engineer a tip system into things like Telegram, Slack, Reddit, Twitter, Discord, etc. There are already example of this with companies like Braves BAT token as well as tip bots like Tip.cc. If we could start getting these tip systems into crypto, technology, finance, etc. based chat channels with intriguing use cases we could get a lot of attention on ADA. Imagine how cool it would be to join a Slack channel and then get rewarded ADA based on your contribution to the topics at hand?

Charles Hoskinson has already mentioned that it is one of the priorities. I think that before defining any model we need to study and analyze the options that exist at Ethereum.

The order book exchange model proved ineffective to gain popularity, since keeping everything on chain increases friction, as it causes cost increases and you depend on submitting the transaction on the blockchain.  

The AMM model proved to be very popular, especially with Uniswap, but in my opinion there is room for improvement, as the Uniswap model brings more incentives to arbitrators than to liquidity providers.

We must also think about the issue of interoperability, as there are already different decentralized exchange projects with support for multi blockchains, in addition there are different models to implement this type of DEX.

Quite unfinished, and does not mention voluntary tipping (although it should be presumed to be allowable) or potential mod actions that annotate non-commercial content or community majority actions that annotate entire private threads.

Edit: Continuing to think on this, sponsor should be given the ability to initially append advertisement posts at a marginally higher rate (determined by a majority vote of those affected, triggered by append, retriggered by quorum tx for adjustment) to private threads, though the premium mods already have to deal with quorum-decided ""no confidence"" votes, so it will be more difficult for advertiser-sponsors to even get approval.

Edit2: I should have made it clearer, but once information is introduced to the basic forum, there should be no action to remove or obfuscate it besides a majority public vote to archive and remove from front page (whatever the aggregating algo).

Edit3: The initial vote can be triggered by the individual public action of appending a sponsored (approved by mod) poll post to gather membership for a quorum.

Getting Haskell dependencies to work (the right versions of libraries) is difficult.. My favorite development environment is Elm, which is similar to Haskell without some of the higher-level features like type classes, but through enforced semantic versioning, getting the right dependancy tree is never an issue (it might be more flexible with hash-based dependency validation like Nix).. Elm's also strictly evaluated like Plutus, not to mention the notoriously helpful compiler errors.. if it does compile, you can have confidence that there are no runtime exceptions, and then maybe you can spin up a web-based testing environment so that you can see if you have encoded the correct business logic.  

There are a lot of rough edges in GHC/Haskell that are addressed in different ways by different people.. due to its history as a research language.. it has a lot of features for playing around with cutting edge research ideas in functional programming but it doen't hide the complexity of the necesary features for a given use case very well.

Local pooling would be set up by an individual with other individuals they they know personally. A contract would last for a pre-decided period of time (i.e. 1 year). An example would be 12 individuals decide to set up a local pool each add $100 per month. Therefore in month 1 there is $1200 in the pool (generating interest through a variety of means i.e Staking and other De-fi platforms). Each user is therefore entitled to £1200 plus the interest at the end of the term. Users can also request to have their entitlement before the end of the the contract (in this case 1 year) at the expense of the interest generated on their capital. If several people request their capital and there are more requests than capital available the pool leader would decide who will be assigned the payment.  

Community pooling would be the same however there is no pool leader and the ""poolers"" do not know one another - essentially the pool leader is the Dapp/protocol itself.  

There is more to explain and iron out - One such example is the necessity for mature Defi/interest generating protocols on Cardano.

Generally, that increases aggregate efficiency in business and like you said, putting control in the hands of reviewers and consumers reaps even more benefits for the brands. I'm just concerned that the mechanism is permissioned (i.e. the brand arbitrarily gives out the mechanism that consumers may or may not access). And if bad actor reviews are a concern, perhaps this should be implemented with Atala PRISM so that confirmed customers are 100% allowed to publically broadcast their reviews. It's win-win because brands are given more competitive pressure to promote quality assurance, and there's more incentive for people to become ambassadors because there's social proof that their constructive criticism made a product better made and better recognized.

But once brands are able to attach a simple QR code which people can scan and review the product, it will lead to firstly identity matching and then the review will directly convey message to the brands. So loyalty can be proven. Till now this loop was broken by the retailers where they took over the ownership of this relationship. Moreover there was no way to incentivize the users to put reviews. Now that we have smart contract, voltaire and of course our favorite ADA token all these blocks fall into the right place. We can prove true loyalty and also brands would be more than happy to directly interact with consumers. Coming back to the question of creating scarcity, the products that are released to the market, not all will be eligible for awards. It can be a lottery based system where particular people for a certain period of time, will be sampled (in an automated way) based on geography, time and other parameters which will be programmed into the smart contracts.

Yes you're right that in Muslim countries Islamic banking is available but there are still millions of Muslims in non majority Muslim countries who are excluded from banking or have to compromise to access loans. In Islam dealing in interest is forbidden for example (the full details of what constitutes shariah compliance are out with the scope of a small comment here).

  

Also muslims in countries with access to compliant banking still have to deal with the old legacy paradigms regarding who is financially viable and for what amount. Banks take almost no risk beyond the initial loan whereas I feel that when giving business loans for example the bank should become an investor who is also liable if the project fails, this means that the bank has an interest in the business succeeding and banks should have whole teams of small business support specialists who are there to nurture and provide networking for their customers. This would also mean that banks would be reluctant to pull the plug on people struggling. Of course businesses fail and the banks would have to eat the loss.

  

Banks should no be able to ""fire and forget"" so to speak, on the process.

You might need a server running a simple website that hands out their key and gives instruction on how to setup a wallet. Then how to turn ADA into fiat. Anyone who has the key can unlock the ada after they do all the pre-requisite steps, but if the key times out (2 weeks?) the escrow dapp returns the tip to the issuer.

I completely agree that we would need to get insurance companies on board! And I believe much of the process can be automated. Just as the blockchain can eliminate many of the fee collecting middle-men, I believe there is a potential to automate much of the claim adjudication process by utilizing smart contracts. If there were a clearly defined contract that could instantly determine whether or not a patient was covered, and further whether or not the requested services were covered and to what extent, I think there is a lot of potential to minimize the confusion that occurs (creating double/excess billings, uncovered services, etc.).

Any project that can not achieve its goals in a timely manner is in breach of the contract, in my estimation.

THIS raises a point that we have had heated debate over in Fund1. I think that a contract is required, that spells out what will be done by whom over what timeframe. Then prior to any further fund release, these must be proven true, or explained and re-submitted for further funding.

I am speaking in general terms here, and understand that there is a lot of detail and nuance that is missing.

Additionally, we do not have the ability to write smart contracts to ""oversee"" the funding dispersal.  

Once we do have, there is little to stop us from utilizing something very akin to a Project Draw schedule, which requires inputs from a non-biased party to confirm milestone acceptance. This acceptance would trigger the next round of funding (DRAW) against the contract.

This is a very long discussion which has already been heated in the past, and needs to be further discussed and either codified, or..

As for virtue signalling, it might emotionally sway a plurality of people, but it doesn't pay the bills. Hobbies by themselves might offer actualization and vindication of one's lifestyle, but they do not pay the bills.

How are you? Well, not really inventing the wheel here. Affilite programms are as old as .....well.....they-re old:grinning:

Rather than going out trying to reach every business in the world, give them a meccanism where they are incentivised to do the work for you. 

I would expand on the idea as well and i ll post this separately. Currenly to my knowledge there is no way of knowing which or what business in the world is accepting ADA for payment, which is at the moment the simplest application there is for any business to interact with Cardano.

We have a hotel in Barcelona which accepts ADA. There might be a restaurant in Barcelona as well that accepts ADA. If we knew who they were, we could reach out and develop common marketing strategies.

  

So a good start would be to create a simple website, a type of index, where any business that is either already accepting ADA for payment or interested in doing so, can list themselves. So we can see a community of business starting to grow.

In the same way a musician is paid a 'royalty' payment each time their music is played on the radio. This would incentivize the creation and use of DAPS on the Cardano blockchain.

Cardano would establish a 'DAP royalty' wallet in the treasury. A portion of the rewards from the treasury's overall stake could be used to fund this wallet creating a sustainable DAP runtime 'royalty' payment fund. The value of the 'royalty' could be derived at DAP runtime using a variety of static or dynamic methods.

Cardano would establish a DAP registry (Cardano DAP Store) on the Cardano blockchain for authoritative DAP binaries and their related authentication meta-data such as DAP release hash/signatures, DAP author public keys and DAP author 'royalty' wallet addresses.

Cardano would establish a runtime library that would be compiled into DAP binaries by their authors. This runtime code would use the DAP's registry meta-data to embed a 'royalty' payment mechanism unique to the DAP's author directly in the DAP binaries.

Each time a registered DAP executes a transaction that utilizes ADA on the Cardano blockchain, the 'royalty' payment mechanism embedded in the DAP binary would process a 'royalty' withdrawal from the 'royalty' wallet in the treasury and a subsequent 'royalty' deposit to the DAP author's 'royalty' wallet address.

Yes, marketing would be quite important here. For example, showing that, if a dApp is interoperable with Cardano, it can be used across any chain.",NO

Instead, we can have some leaderboards based on specific problems (categories) solved by a dApp. The problems can be decided by the community and the dApps can be selected by individual ratings.

The other aspect could be to have a dApp profile page which lists the motivation behind the dApp, link to git-repo, etc",NO

Episode 7 - FRB + GS

\=======

We left off in Ep#6 talking about magical possibilities unlocked to build the future of money with that old 'Gold Standard' thing holding us back... what could go wrong?

Sponsored video series that explorers alternates views of that future.

Recap:

FRB => Introduced in Ep#2, expanded significantly in Ep#3. There's a graphic in Ep#5 at 6:20 which really brings home relationship of deposit = leverage lending under FRB

Mortgages introduced in Ep#3. ""Unlocking money in your house"" => Kind of foreshadows that houses have value that people attribute to them... and they are notionally replaceable with money of fluctuating worth. When the gold standard existed, if your house was worth $10k, you knew how much gold you could trade it for... and how much total money there was (within reason)... making it realistic to determine the house's 'fair value'.

Segue:

How FRB and GS combine! Captain planet reference?

These two issues unify in reality, because FRB doesn't actually pin deposited money to lent money. It just pins any form of 'asset' capital that bank can use as security. Why does this matter? Because without the GS it actually lets banks print money from thin air as part of debt issuance. Where once this was constrained by the GS because it constrained the maximum value of the assets, we have had 50 years of printing where banks are only constrained by regulators about how much fractional leverage they are allowed to operate under, even when the 'assets' they are leveraging may only have a perceived or floating value. Additionally, the ratio is assessed with blinkers on, creating debt issuance cycles that massively expand money supplies. We've seen these debt bubbles before somewhere (links to South Seas video and Ep#4 John law).

This has some dangerous long running consequences. Which we can demonstrate easily through an example. This example assumes this jurisdiction requires banks to maintain a FRB ratio of 10:1 at worst.

A land developer purchases a large swathe of land on the edge of town for $100k. It has no civic services, roads or existing residents. Let us assume for the sake of argument this is 'fair value' for the day.

They convince the bank that they can spend $500k to extend all the various civic services into this area and parcel up the land into 10 smaller pieces which are now all going to be worth $100k each. The developer agrees to pay the bank back $600k ($100k interest) as soon as the land is sold, but will secure the loan against the land (maybe they have other assets too). The bank is loaning (i.e. printing) $500k against a $100k land parcel (FRB 5:1) but is risk mitigating against potential future fair value of $1000k, so they feel safe.

\* Developer walk away with $400k, $300k is profit.

\* Bank walks away with $600k, $100k is profit. $500k gets written down because it was printed in the first place. They didn't really do anything here except some account keeping and risk assessment. Also they likely have to give some of that $100k to the central bank as interest on the printed money... but it is certainly much lower than their profits.

\* Developer staff, contractors and suppliers walk away with $500k in salaries/profits. This money enters the economy. Win for capitalism!!

Then look at who bought the land... Probably 10 families that came in with $20k deposits and borrowed $180k from the bank (9:1 FRB ratios), claiming they are going to spend $100k on the land, $100k to build a house, resulting in an asset worth $300k at the end. They secure the loan using their fictional $300k house (which an accredited valuing agency rubber stamps... because land prices always go up right? You can change the 'margin' here if you like, it doesn't alter the baseline premise... we are just keeping the numbers neat).

We are ignoring taxes in this example, but of course government gets a cut of all this too. Governments spend their money back into the economy anyway.

What do things look like after the dust settles at the end of the mortgages?

\* Home owners (each) hold a $300k asset after a very long time paying back the bank.

\* Bank would typically at least double their money on a 25-30 year mortgage. Let's say $350k, so they write down the $180k they printed and make $170k profit.... times 10 home owners.

\* Construction staff and suppliers walk away net a total $1000k across all 10 properties which heads off into the economy.

So in total now, with a developer putting down $100k and a total of $200k deposits from home owners we have made $3000k of house assets and generated $3600k in cash that got injected into the economy. So we turned $300k of FRB 'deposits' into $6600k of economic activity, both cash and assets (That is a 22:1 ratio if you are keeping track). And this example is sooo extremely simplistic it is crazy.

We simplified:

\* How banks keep their accounts. I'm not even sure I really understand this completely, but it isn't simple ""money in/money out"". See overnight markets etc.

\* We just looked at one simple journey of a piece of land. You can look at it from the developer perspective who will take their profit and buy bigger land next time... meaning over our 25-30 year time horizon they will multiply that 22:1 ratio even more and more.

\* You can look at it from a home owners perspective who will typically refinance their home later to get more debt and perhaps buy investment properties or open a small business... again multiply the ratios more.

\* Or look at it from a bank's perspective, since they've realised as long as someone signs off on the value of an asset they can leverage the crap out of it... to make more assets... to leverage them more... and more (\*cough\* GFC). <== this is scarier than everything else... on steroids. But I haven't even unpacked it and the system is still dangerously rotten without. The derivatives market is banking's dirty little not-secret they keeps sweeping under the rug and hope the world doesn't pay attention.

The GS used to constrain the maximum size of an asset bubble... but that safety is long gone now.

Focusing back on just the property market the real problem in there is that the entire chain is built on the idea that the value is always going up in the long term... because that is all anyone has know in recent memory... but what happens when something shocks the whole system... even temporarily? It doesn't really matter what triggers the shock (GFC or Covid-19)... the real underlying problem is there is no longer a GS that backs what our assets are worth, so their value has exploded exponentially... which means they have a long, long way to fall when perception and 'fair value' become uncertain, when debts start getting defaulted on and when business start declaring bankruptcy and the bubble pops.

Would be good the frame the ending of Ep#7 as a juxtaposition to Ep#6 ending which heralded how awesome it would be to let everyone just agree on something's value.  

Episode 8 - Crypto emerges

\=========

We have had 50 years exploring what it looks like with FRB and no gold standard... that is such a tiny window, even just in 'modern history' terms. If you look at this in 25 year mortgage 'cycles'... that is basically two non-overlapping generations. Even in such a short time there are some pretty worrying signs about what it has done to things.

People have been worried about this for decades. Matrix analogy... gnawing worry and convinced something isn't right, but for most people this has been the accepted norm their entire lives. Mainstream economists and media seem to think everything is fine. Looking for the 'red pill'...

Satoshi's famous white paper. BTC history piece ((((THIS SHOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY FLESHED OUT))))

Pizza for BTC - expensive pizzas <= fluff story?

  

1st generation - Knee-jerk reactions and attempts to What are people trying to do?

\* Consistency of supply. Avoid shocks like gold rush, but allow for inflation.

\* Open vs private.

\* De-power the government. Empower people

\* Others?

\* Security through proof of work.... (this needs to be de-mystified)

  

2nd generation

\* Alt coins emerge. Flame wars... like Apple vs Android.

\* Even BTC maxis

\* ICO craze

\* Stablecoins

\* Lots of financial speculation and market is growing.

\* distributed computing shows a vision for the future.

Landscape is the wild west. Lots of ideas. Not a lot of delivery.

  

  

Episode 9 - Crypto evolves

\=========

2nd generation ETH1 dominates but cracks starting to show. Distributed computing captures billions in financial instruments (DEFI), but we have security struggles, scaling struggles and governance struggles.

BTC looms in a more stable way in the background, where far more assets are parked waiting for a clear direction of the future. Some work on 1st Generation products are seeking to slowly bring smart contracts to BTC. But the maxis fight back.

Crypto winter... heading to spring now. All the work over the last years starting to bear fruit.

Central Banks starting to enter the space. CBDCs => Printing mechanisms.... instead of pouring into the financial system and just praying... you can universally distribute out to citizens without the Government. Is more power to central banks a good thing?

  

3rd generation projects.

\* Various projects emerging that are trying build a new system, with lessons learned from the first 2 generations.

\* Explore Proof of Staking instead of PoW.

\* Do an around the grounds looking at various players like ETH2, EOS, XTZ etc.

\* End on Cardano and unpack financial operating systems vs 'currency'

  

Banking the unbanked. Emerging countries and governments building economies 'right' and seeking to skip the 19th and 20th century experiments that Western nations are stuck with.

Governance is the big thing to get right first. Raise project catalyst... the big sell here is that no one company reached out to sponsor these videos. It was a community effort, voted by the community, out of the Cardano Treasury system. We want more people involved so we are building the right solutions for everyone.

We want more people involved, but not just in Cardano, in the whole crypto community. We want small and large businesses to think about how it could help them. We want entrepreneurs and creatives in our community helping us craft visions. We want developers helping us build. We want project and product managers helping us keep all this enthusiasm moving in a productive direction.

19/Sep/20 4:05 AM,320085,716,Alfred Moesker - (CASH Stakepool - Hotel Ginebra),"Hi @katherinedasilva858 

How are you??

Nice to see your reaction. I am not exactly inventing the wheel here. Affiliate programms are as old as....welll....they very old...:grinning: and the principle is simple. Rather than trying to reach out to everybody yourself, create your army to helo you do the work for you.

We own a hotel in Barcelona (first business in the world to accept ADA in fact( and we work with reservatoin portals such as Booking.com.  
Booking.com is not just a website. They literellay have thousands of affiiliate websites that all bring the reservations into their centralised booking system.

They are number one in their business because they have been succesful in implement that exact strategy.

Whatever they incentives might be for any business that is using Cardano products is of later concenr. What it important is to create the structure. They rest is decoration.

So lets start at the beginning.

LIke i sad, our hotel in Barcelona which is called Hotel Ginebra, accepts ADA for payment/ It would be great for us to know if there were any other business in Barcelona which accept ADA as well.

For example if we were to know that there is a restaurant which accepts ADA, we can then send people there and develop commin marketing strategies. The problem is that there is no way of knowing if there any such other businesses. So what we need first of all is to create a website, portal, whatever you wish to call it wich serves as an index. An index where all companies that interact with some type of Cardano product (and currently that is still limited to accepting ADA) .

Once i have by business listed, Hotel Ginebra, i would love to be incentivised into going out there and finding other hotels that also would like to accept ADA. Why? Because i think its great to be part of the movement.

But it would be even more interesting for me, if somehow i got incentised to do so. Hence the affiliate system. Either get paid in ADA for every x amount of business i go and signup to accept ADA (or other Cardano products of the future)

Then....you can also create an affiliate programm for Developers. The same logic applies. Developers are usually part of developer communities. They know eachother the same way i know other hotel owners in Barcelona. So incentivse Developer A to contact his buddies and get them to sign up onto the portal where the Cardano Dapp developer community lives.

This can in fact be the same website which once started as in index which lists all businesss that accept ADA or use Cardano products. One part is the index, the other part is where business and developers can get in touch with eachother. The developers can showcase their products and the businesses can look around for products that are interesting to them, or in case they have new ideas, find the developer that is right for the job. This part of the website can be structured like existing portals for webdesigners like FIverrr.com for example. Except that we are creating such a portal for Cardsno Dapp developers.

Then, on another level, you can also turn ADA hollders into affliates and create an affiate programm for them. If ADA holder A manages to get 10 people to download Daedalus, Yoroi etc, and put ADA in them, there ccan be rewards.

  

Lastly, and you may notice that this repy is actually a few idas bundled into one grand idea...we can convert theCarano meetups into marketing machines. Create marketing materiail with the Cardano Foundation which on request can be shipped, or downloaded, by the meetop organisers.  
A meetup organises can have a Level, lets say level 5. He can then ask meetup attendees if they are interested in trying to board businesses into accepting ADA. This again is an old concept but works amazingly succesful if you set it up properly. It was perhaps invented by Tupperware in the sixties (?) where they meetups took place at the homes of women who looked after their houses.  
  
I think creating affiliate programms would be SPECIFICALLY INTERESTING for Cardano, because.....we do not have to go and find an army of volunteers. We already have one!!! There are so many people enthusastic about getting or being involved in Cardano and all they are waiting for is to be given the tools to go and make a difference.

I hope the above gives you abit of an idea of what i have in mind and it would be great if you replied, forwarded it to your friends, gave me a follow and lets see if we can develoop this raw idea into something that we can present as a serious candidate for funding.

Hereby i would also like to invite anybod else who reads this to contribute to developting the ideas put forwards. More than likely there are some of you who have experienc with working with or developing affliate programms. It would be great to hear from you as well.

  

Cheers

This could be initiated by creating ""prizes"" at a few prominent film festivals, using ADA, to create film shorts that creatively highlight features of Cardano, and which tell it in a compelling story format.

Projects could even be 2 step, with initial proposals being submitted as a 2-5 minute pitch, which is then voted on.

This would not only start to get creatives thinking about Cardano and digging into how to sell it, but start creating interesting content to appeal to a broader audience.

2\. Build more content. Fund a longer series of shorts to the winner(s), which will become part of a series about Cardano to create buzz.

An alternative would be that a broader contest is opened up to worldwide filmmakers, with the winners of the film festival prizes getting an automatic advancement through the first round (or two).

3\. In the process of this contest, the infrastructure/interface for a film crowdsourcing app would be built. People can pitch their projects, potentially get funding. This could spin off into non-Cardano related films, and be supported by people internationally.

The early phases of such a crowdsourcing site would have one additional requirement -- crew would have to be paid in ADA. Which would then lean on the applicants/contestants to recruit film crew to register with the site as well. So in the process you now have a community of filmmakers, who recruit a community of crew to help create the film, all of whom are willing to be paid with ADA.

This ultimately becomes self-sustaining where filmmakers can post projects/pitches, anyone can fund it anywhere, and the infrastructure is all built in to vote up/down projects, and go through the crew/production from within the site.

4\. Projects can be explored to then create relationships with other institutions such as studios, streamers, for distribution of films, TV shows, etc, with potential new tech securing rights through the blockchain.

We already had the idea for the animation serie ""What if?"" before this cardano ideascale opened its doors. It is created with the general public as a target group. We would like to make blockchain possibilities alive in a easy and fun way and think animation is the perfect way. So for example if you talk about blockchain with friends or familiy, you can show them a short wellmade animation that helps you to explain why you are enthusiastic about this technolgie. Would be great if this could be realised but I dont the path to walk yet.  

However the challange posted here is to get developers etc. build on cardano. This is a different target group with other needs and the ""What if?"" serie is not a sollution for this.

Maybe easy is not the right word(developers are maybe looking for a challange) but it should just be little step to take. A small step to explore Cardano.

Great points! I think one of the biggest struggles currently is the lack of understanding of the technology by those in charge of creating the regulations. If the community itself, and the specialists within the group, had a heavier hand in driving the regulations it could ease wide-spread adoption.

Forking overhead costs/gaining social independence on the Citcoin fork.

Promoting/Reaching out to Gitcoin for Haskell support and Cardano Grants.

Establishing a robust social network for partnership and developer training such as Haskell Buddy.

Keeping things copacetic (moderating antagonism and destructively competitive practices). This last point is because our ultimate end isn't getting paid, it's pumping out high-quality code and expanding developer resources.

Eventually, insurance plans, ennuities, trusts and the like can all be automated away using smart contracts. Those three alone could bring in a huge number of financial advisors (and all their assets under management). Once plutus is finalized, templates for these three can be created.

There is one major problem though: financial advisors can only offer government approved and certified products. So while smart contracts naturally lend themselves to these products, unless governments approve we won't see them being adopted into the mainstream. I cannot speak for all governments but I don't see the United States government accepting smart contracts any time soon. I also don't think insurance, ennuities, and trusts are top on the list for developing countries.  

This isn't to say that these smart contracts shouldn't be pursued. I am just trying to keep expectations grounded. These products won't drive massive adoption until governments come around.

One avenue that could be explored instead is tokenomics. These tokens are virtually the same thing as company stocks. The tokens could even be adapted to operate similar to coporate bonds. I have not thought through this entirely but I think this is another disruptive area.

I can see the dynamic you name between our opportunities for short term pumping by chasing headlines, versus sustainable, strongly rooted growth via diverse, distributed projects.

It is possible to think of Fund 2 as an exploratory round that provides just enough funding to Catalyst proposals to launch and explore, and then to report back/ask for much more funding in Fund 3 and/or Fund 4.

As a community, we could even make this an unwritten norm by encouraging proposers to include Funds 2 thru 4 and potential future funding requests in any roadmaps that accompany proposals.

18/Sep/20 2:00 PM,319316,350,Greg Pendlebury,"@enchstyle  & @vkokorev  FWIW, my background approaches this from a Government and Library perspective, so a lot of the comments here already demonstrate more knowledge than I on the 'peer review' and 'academia' side of the house. I should also note I left the sector a few years ago and my knowledge might not have aged perfectly… or have been understood correctly to begin with.

But if it assists you in any way, here's the tough nut to crack as I see it. With examples drawn from the Australian research sector… but I think this is true (but with variations) for most of the world.

1) Most research funding in Australia flows out of large government or pseudo-government bodies like ARC (https://www.arc.gov.au/) and NHMRC (https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/).

2) Such grant funding already includes standard contractual clauses that mandate open access to the journal outputs, and increasingly the data that backs those articles (less strenuous there). But these are not exclusive, so publication is allowed elsewhere as well. POINT1 <= I circle back to this later.

3) To satisfy that requirement many research offices or libraries run some sort of eprints (or similar) repository. Some Unis do a great job here… a lot are just phoning it in really.

4) At the national level there was a project called ARROW to aggregate this into national systems. It is hard to even find references to this anymore, as it has basically died, despite being officially moved under the hosting of the National Library of Australia. There was some bad politics between NLA and other academic bodies too. NLA was given no funding to actually sustain or improve anything and there's no actual plan associated with what people were going to use ARROW for either.

5) NLA also ran an instance of Open Journal System (OJS), but I have no idea why. I worked at NLA after both OJS and ARROW were in their sunset years. I actually thought it would have been a great platform to push for real change… but no one was interested and no one had money.

6) Most of the funding in academia had moved on the (apparently) new and sexy of problem fo research *data* (because ARROW 'solved' journals right? right?). Anyway, the government poured literally billions of dollars into NCRIS (https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris) which has changed form many time times over the years. There was expensive investment there on sexy cloud computing, but also other things like storage, open access and catalogues like RDA (https://researchdata.edu.au/).

7) A fair bit of that work remains current, including digital identity management for academics as their move around the sector during their careers. But it is also fair to say their are various dead projects that half solved problems along the way and then got abandoned because (again) there was no sustainable funding for them. e.g. RDA had deep integration into People Australia at the NLA, which included issuance of a national digital ID. <= This broke after a political stouch. NLA refused to fix it without more funding, NCRIS says Libraries are not Universities and played chicken until everyone got bored and left... insane.

8) Before I worked at the NLA, I spent several years in contract developer roles across different NCRIS projects, looking at this from different angles. I mention that just to say it is a deep, deep topic to try and unpack what they spent sooo much money on. It is usually not *directly* relevant to this issue of open access… but with so many systems and organisations involved they routinely crop up whenever someone wants to change things… and they might even present partnership opportunities. They have a national consortium of ICT focused people with AERO: https://aero.edu.au/ who bring all the state bodies together to collaborate.

9) So… back to POINT1 from above. Remember how grant funding only requires that *also* provide open access? It is important to look at where else they send that as well. To start that journey I first have to zoom out and look at what was called 'DEST categories' when I was involved… they probably have a different name now, but it still serves to demonstrate things.

10) The name came from the old 'Department of Education, Science and Training': https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education,_Science_and_Training, which is of course no more, but the name hung around for a while. DEST broke up every peer review journal into various categories (think A, B, C, D, E) and then ranked Universities by how much research output they put into different ones. I can't find the modern equivalent (it might be HERDC), but just find lots of broken links to 'DEST's Register_of_Refereed_Journals'.

11) Every year, every Uni would have to tally up the collective outputs of all their academics into each of those categories, then DEST would write the Uni a big fat cheque based on how awesome they were as a research university. There were published reports and Unis ranked against each other. Of course it gets very political and prestige based dick measuring.

11A) POINT2!!! Money, Money, Money

12) That of course then permeates into how academics are treated when they turn up in front of an academic progression board for a chance at a promotion each year. I even managed to find a link on the web to how one uni at least weights all this stuff: https://www.mq.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/55849/All-Publications-Categories.pdf See how they look at the size of what is written, which category of journal (or similar) it gets published to, and then gets given a score.

12A) POINT3!!! Everyone looks after their career.

13) What is less political and more anecdotal is what the academic then does after they get published. They naturally want to include their own material inside of course content, so they go to their library and make sure that electronic access to that journal is being purchased/subscribed for students.

14) Now we start the journey of closed access content. What do these journals do with their publication platforms? They wrap search indexes around them and sell them of course.

15) I recall, back when I was working in Uni libraries, that there were a few elite journals that managed to hold out and run their own search platforms, but I think they have mostly gone the way of the dinosaurs as the major electronic platforms just gobbled up more and more content… which they then proceed to bundle.

16) Bundling is the most insane bullsh!t in the world. These guys know exactly what they are doing. You ask for direct access to the single DEST category A title the academic got published into and you get some stupidly high price. But they wrap it into a bundle with 2,999 other category E titles and put the price up by like 10-20%… this makes the per-title price look much better, but that is not why the library wants to buy the bundle… and everyone knows this. It is as rare as hen's teeth that the library will be specifically asked to purchase access to *any* of the low tier category titles. Bundles just let them charge more.

16A) POINT4!!! Aggregators are dicks. Academics don't see the big picture in the Library funding model. Libraries don't have enough money. Libraries are paying for the stuff the University GAVE AWAY FOR FREE!!!!

17) The sad part for me about the whole thing is that the aggregation platforms are large multi-nationals that have locked this stuff under copyright for many, many years to come. This hits different faculties harder than others… e.g. hard science articles 'age' more quickly than humanities articles (I am generalising)

18) So, even if you achieve Utopia inside your own country and convince the Governments and Universities to stop the vicious cycle of funding where we pay for stuff, give it away and then buy it back from the company we gave it to… you still need access to material from other countries.

19) So, then after every country finally solves this problem and all *new* material is going into open access platforms, you still have a problem with all the older copyrighted material.

20) The one practical path forward I mentioned to a colleague about 10 years ago is that we can achieve enough change that we can finally shock the big vendors into considering a pro-active change to their models. If we can start squeezing the data flowing into those platforms their is a glimmer of hope that they can stop selling their content and start selling their services in tech instead, with a view to getting them to unlock their older content on a healthier financial footing.

18/Sep/20 12:09 PM,320167,751,Big J,"""How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?""

There can be many reasons why developers and entrepreneurs are not building on Cardano. This is also not easy to answer as it would need research in the field therefor I would approach this like changing a habit. Let me explain:)

I just read the book ""atomic habits"" by James Clear. In his book he gives a system on how to create new good habits. You could say that developers already have the habit of building but the ""problem"" is that they are not building on the Cardano blockchain. How can we change this ""bad habit"" in a ""good habit"".

James talks about four steps to create a new habit.

1 make it obvious

2 make it attractive

3 make it easy

4 make it satisfying

The key to success is to make the steps as small as possible. So instead of thinking about how a developer can build the next mega app (new Uber or Facebook etc.) on Cardano, how can a developer make a really small step and do something whit Cardano.

For example, I think it would be great if every time a developer drinks a cup of coffee, he spends 1 minute of his attention to Cardano. This habit can lead to big things. The developer is not taking any risk by wasting time or money. With every cup of coffee, the developer learns about the Cardano project a little bit more and will feel a little bit more comfortable with cardano. This habit is a system that will really increase the possibility that the next real project will be built on cardano.

At the moment there is great content about cardano on the internet but most of it is way to long and is useless if you are drinking a cup of coffee and would like to improve yourself by learning something about cardano.

Making the journey from first contact with cardano to building the first smart contract or a small app as easy as possible. Chuck it up in small parts that all take hardly any time. If this experience is great it will change the bad habbit (building on Ethereum) to a good habit (building on Cardano:) ).

I love to hear from you what you think of this approach.

18/Sep/20 12:09 PM,319316,350,Vasily Kokorev,"@oleum  , @enchstyle 

Thanks for engaging in this discussion. This is an interesting question. There is no silver bullet approach, but I had a few ideas on the subject.

I would start by creating an on-chain identity where your degree is verified, and then we know that this person is a Ph.D. in Mathematics, for example. You can also pair it with ORCID to have previous publications record. You will need to find a balance between the complexity of onboarding and the quality of information that we have about the user. The point is we should have some form of confirmed academic credentials. Notable specialists without a degree can be registered by others verifying their credentials. Once we know basic info such as degree, the field of expertise, keywords of previous publications, it is possible to make a system that will automatically suggest reviewers, and it up to them to accept or decline. It is a system that is far from perfect, but it is not worse than most mid-tier journals. But we can have a few other improvements.

Another idea to improve the system can be to have a dedicated person who should sign on the quality of the review. First, we select three people with a degree in the same field with interests as close to the topic as possible who agree to do a review. Out of these three, one is randomly selected to be an arbiter, who should confirm that the reviews abide by some basic quality standards. The arbiter might also have to nominate one reviewer in his place, so the total number of reviewers is uneven again. One manually selected reviewer also makes sure that there is somebody with a deep understanding of the topic. You also need a system of financial incentives and a reputation that will incentivize people to do the right thing. I tried to work it out and have some vague idea of how it should be, but it is a complex problem.

Lastly, I think there could be something like journals still with the different editorial policies defined in code. For example, one could be something like arXiv.org where you can post anything after minimal check that it is not gibberish. If your name is already in high standing, it could be good enough, and then people can review the article if they want. Another ""journal"" could be something like the system described above, where there is a review from automatically selected reviewers. While it is not ideal, it is still a peer review. There is also a place for a more traditional approach, where there is an editor who appoints reviewers. Then the journal policy will define that the arbiter is also one from the predefined list. Different ""journals"" will gain various levels of reputations and prestige, and everybody can find something that suits them.

Finally, I think that centralization in the peer review process, while not great, is not necessarily the problem. The problem is publishers who charge outrages amount of money for doing nothing. The distributed system can help to get rid of them. If we have to keep the centralized editorial policy to achieve that, fine, I can live with that.",NO

It's called one-to-many delegation or partial delegation and it also includes a ""playlist/poollist"" for you to share with others... This will help small pools tremendously.  

This has been discussed in Charles' AMAs https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/ilsn4c/shelley_update_transcript_defi_work_stablecoin/

When we look to September and beyond there's a few different threads that are coming one of them is this concept of partial delegation (one-to-many delegation). Instead of saying that you have to atomically delegate your entire wallet, you can go one to n pools (1 single wallet delegates to several different pools) and then this will enable some new ideas. For example, things like delegation portfolios. So, you can choose a collection of pools and ratios to each pool and then you can share that and import those lists.  

Also, vacuumlabs is gonna do one-to-many delegation on Ledger and Trezor (HW-wallets) that's actually quite straightforward to do but then we're also gonna see if we can do pledging.

We're actually exploring all of these ideas on how to do that and this is part of the relationship with Vacuumlabs so they're going to very least give us multi-sig pledging (see next paragraph, small pools coming together and creating one big pledge and sharing profits afterwards) and one-to-many delegation and we're also going to have the hardware wallet center coming in Daedalus so you'll be able to delegate from your Ledger or Trezor device with Daedalus just like you can with adalight (wallet) and Yoroi so all those features are coming.  

Another thing that I'm really keen to do is multi-sig pledging. Basically multi-sig pledging is where you have smaller pools come together and they pull their capital together and then they use that for a unified pledge. So, we have a situation where some people no matter how favorable the protocol gets with parameters just really not they don't have enough capital quite yet to be able to be competitive. Instead of complaining about it let them work together and then be able to work something out where they can collectively pledge and that collective pledge can count as one pool and then they can split up the profits by whatever scheme that they want. We're going to explore multi-sig pledging, we're going to explore KES-proxies. There's a lot of things to think about that are coming on the horizon not necessarily in September.

This is part of what's required to enable people to calculate how much tax they owe for most countries, the calculation of the tax itself depends on the jurisdiction.

Getting paid for making contributions to projects that benefit the larger community would be a good thing.

Having spent some time in Africa trying to help improve some people's quality of life, there are a lot of ways that developing software for people within a particular nation could help, but the ability to produce something that can easily be shared with and enjoyed by people around the world has a higher potential for change — when you're talking about places where people are too worried about feeding their families to think about automation.

Giving people too many handouts can often be detrimental to their ability to be independent and self-sustaining, but if you help them develop skills and give them access to a global community that wants to pay for those skills or the products you create with them — the incentive is to make interesting things happen.

This is a concept in which the Cardano blockchain treasury would pay out a DAP runtime 'royalty' payment to the DAP's author each time a DAP was to successfully execute a transaction that utilizes ADA on the Cardano blockchain. In the same way a musician is paid a 'royalty' payment each time their music is played on the radio. This would incentivize the creation and use of DAPS on the Cardano blockchain.  

Cardano would establish a 'DAP royalty' wallet in the treasury. A portion of the rewards from the treasury's overall stake could be used to fund this wallet creating a sustainable DAP runtime 'royalty' payment fund. The value of the 'royalty' could be derived at DAP runtime using a variety of static or dynamic methods.

Cardano would establish a DAP registry (Cardano DAP Store) on the Cardano blockchain for authoritative DAP binaries and their related authentication meta-data such as DAP release hash/signatures, DAP author public keys and DAP author 'royalty' wallet addresses.

Cardano would establish a runtime library that would be compiled into DAP binaries by their authors. This runtime code would use the DAP's registry meta-data to embed a 'royalty' payment mechanism unique to the DAP's author directly in the DAP binaries.

Each time a registered DAP executes a transaction that utilizes ADA on the Cardano blockchain, the 'royalty' payment mechanism embedded in the DAP binary would process a 'royalty' withdrawal from the 'royalty' wallet in the treasury and a subsequent 'royalty' deposit to the DAP author's 'royalty' wallet address.

If there were resources providing succinct information about what the technology is, what it can currently be used for, and where it may be going, I think it would be extremely helpful.

Simple interface where user makes account --> a wallet is securely created and held in app via traditional password (no long pass phrases to write down) with extra disclaimers of course --> load in some $$ --> silently converted to ADA --> browse pools like you would stocks on robin hood and pick one.

Seems like this would be an easy thing to educate anyone who's already using robinhood, etc. and would bridge the gap that exists with all the ""technical"" hurdles one has to overcome i.e. wallet creation and funding by ""faking it"" and making it truly feel like something familiar... would be great for stake pools too!",NO

But, with that said, you have brought up a lot of ideas I had not thought of.

I was thinking of taking the delegators on trust because to even go out of your way in the first place to

1) want to help small pool owners

2) Seek out a way to help small pools

3) place your name on a list with other delegators to promise to help when the amount reached a certain level

That Shows a pretty good level of commitment on it's face… But, my idea was to shoot for 150% of what you need pledged. In other words, if you need 2 mil to guarantee an average of 1.5 blocks per epoch, wait until you have 2.5 mil promised so if 500,000 drops out, you are still good with 2 mil.

I have some other ideas in the main proposal but I am completely open to anything that will improve the idea and help small pool owners.

(1) With Adrestia - For access to ADA Wallets and making in game currency available

(2) With Smart Contracts - For replacing session server code

(3) With Native Tokens

(4) With Prism - For authentication control and access management/entitlement

(5) Integration into wallets (such as Daedalus or Yoroi in browser)

The idea is to build the resources that can be used by developers to rapidly bring them into the ADA world.

Why? The more popular the games, the more transactions and the more fee's we all collect as ADA holders.

Who benefits? Everyone, from our fees to the developers integrating ADA

How? By creating a thought out framework that has examples of how games can be connected to ADA, either directly by Smart Contracts OR through API services such as Adrestia; but importantly, laying out the pillars so that as capabilties arrive, they can be swapped in, i.e. replacing user authentication and access on the game server and swapping it to use PRISM, but in a standardised way that other games can share that same information.

However, the object you are describing here isn't a bond. In you analogy it is the staked ADA that is the cash flow generating instrument that is analogous to a perpetual bond. The ""SmartBond"" smart contract is nothing but a wrapper around ADA which stipulates how the ADA can be spent and how the ADA is staked. In the financial world this wrapper is called a Trust. In order for a smart contract to be a bond distinct from the ADA that it holds (why would I lock my ADA into a smart contract if I can get the same return just by holding it regularly?) it would need to:

1\. Transform the cash flow of the ADA in a way (or provide an alternative non-ADA driven cashflow) which makes the cash flow of the bond materially different than ordinary staking returns

2\. Be tradeable and transferable (this is what makes a bond different from a loan). This is where my main objections to your use of the term Smart Bond. Your whole idea hinges around time-locking assets such that its owner can only cash out under certain terms. This is antithetical to a notion of a bond which is trade-able by design.

Respectfully, I think you are getting a financial instrument (a contract with cash flow properties that can be traded on the open market) confused with a legal structure which owns those financial instruments (a contract defining a trust / other financial account). That being said, the idea in and of itself is a useful one!

If Cardano is positioned to take over the world, why aren't ""ma and pa"" excited about it?... I

mean, scalability? Interoperability? We know how huge this is but does anyone else understand

what I'm saying when I scream it out my car window at them in the drive thru line?

I've been a true believer since the infamous whiteboard and was over the moon when

Marlowe/meadow/blockly came on line. ""This is big"" I thought. But Cardano still has yet to

overcome hurdles with adoption (the excitement for future adoption to be more specific) and to

be honest, we as a community probably don't do as good a job as we could at helping this

along.

We've all seen so many great cryptographic solutions come to the market. Some (especially in

the financial sector) have been well received on the enterprise level even. But why have almost

0 gained widespread traction with the general population?

Because when you scroll anywhere below the banner on their website you're immediately

blasted with terminology and concepts that confuse and scare you. ELI5 is apparently a concept

not valued very highly in the blockchain industry.

Personally, I believe Cardano's greatest challenge and greatest opportunity will be to bring forth

a solution to a real world problem that is adopted at scale. What measurable ways can we as a

community de-stigmatize and educate ""ma and pa"" about the great things coming from

Our wallet aims to solve this issue and make sure high volumes of sales can be processed without any hiccups.

I'm assuming with the C-fund you have to have some sort of well developed idea and a team ready to go. The idea for DC-fund is that ideas are submitted and there is a innovative and collaborative phase that is conducted before a vote. This provides a venue for ideas that aren't well developed enough for formal funding to get a chance at implementation though community collaboration and support.

Additionally, I don't believe the two funds are mutually exclusive. You've already see Charles saying that he will match any podcast funds raised in the DC-fund 1:1 for $15k.

17/Sep/20 3:48 AM,319341,360,Jeronimo Backes,"This solution aims to be free for everyone. Other than regular transaction fees on the blockchain itself, no one has to pay commissions nor fees. There's no account creation required anywhere.

It works as a straight ""wallet to wallet"" solution:

1\. The shopify app doesn't have anyone's private key (from neither the shop who installs the app nor the customers).

2\. At no point the app server should have access to anyone's funds, even if temporarily.

3\. To enable ada payments, the shop will provide its public root key. Not the private key.

3.1. That root key will be used to generate new receiving addresses on demand

3.2. Every receiving address will be unique. We generate shelley receiving addresses like what daedalus gives out.

3.3. When someone sends ADA to that address, the store owner will receive the ADA directly in their wallet, to which we have no access (we don't know and don't want to know the private key)

4\. When a customer of a store makes a purchase, a new receiving address will be generated and associated with the order

5\. Once the total amount of the order is paid to the receiving address, the order is fulfilled and the shop can send the items purchased to the customer .

5.1. With one receiving address per order we are able to determine that X amount was sent to that particular receiving address, instead of mixing funds with the whole balance of the wallet managed by the store.

In conclusion, the Shopify app is a mere observer of transactions made from one or more (customer) addresses to another (associated with an online purchase). Funds go straight to the shop owner wallet.",NO
17/Sep/20 3:40 AM,319297,339,Greg Pendlebury,"@whycardano  No worries. Thanks for the feedback. To be clear, my curiosity is how is a bond mathematically implemented in a smart contract. Both corporate and government bonds work on the basis that the bond issuer has a revenue stream from whence the interest will be paid. Investors are comfortable with those risks depending on how much they trust that government is stable or that company is profitable. e.g. I'm Australian and very happy holding AUD bonds, no matter what the fed is doing.  
  

If the smart contract has a revenue stream I presume it can only be derived from staking, in the case raw ADA bonds; or currency flucuation gambling, in the case of stablecoins. Neither of those seem like attractive risks to a stakeholder to me if they can just directly stake their ADA and time their use of fiat off-ramps.

My question is genuine though, not critical, as I do agree a bond market is a critical foundation in a financial system. Just keen to hear early thoughts on how to 'sell' this to an investor.",NO

1\. Current environment: Bond holders hold ALL the RISK. (You give your money up for ~0% return but hold all the risk of a bond default)

2\. Speculation is inherently baked-in to holding bonds. Govt bond market = you are usually dealing with a sovereign nation. That still presents risk.

Specifically, when the nation is devaluing it's currency and your spending power...and thus...the intrinsic value of the bond.

3\. If the value of the bond is pegged with a time function, the probability that more users are onboarded within that time frame, goes up. (See any valuable asset's performance over time...charts)

4\. The idea that you are on this chat, posting a comment, signals that there is realized value in the future of this technology called Cardano. Others might find that as the development progresses, so too will the uses...and the demand.

5\. If we have continued buildout, uses, and demand...we have a strong notion of future ADA appreciation.

5a We already have confirmation of the staking rewards. (So this aspect is resolved)

  

to your point about speculation: = understanding there are no guarantees, even in govt bonds, but that with logical analysis one can quantify the risk and then proceed forward or not.

The SMARTbonds use case is simply a rough V1, with plenty of sculpting and shaping left to be had.

For a smart contract to appeal to bond consumers I assume we would FIRST need to have a cardano stablecoin (call it cUSD) and then supporting staking of those... and it isn't clear to me how you would maintain an interest rate on a stablecoin without risk. e.g. a 1% yielding cUSD bond would have contractually guarantee (1 year example):  

100 cUSD => 1111 ADA (at 9c) => staked at 5%p.a => 1166 ADA => fluctuating ADA price... ???

If the price of ADA at the end is 8.6c or higher the contract 'wins'... otherwise it loses.

The stablecoins on other networks have driven developers to make products and services for example some of the defi dapps now eg Uniswap Now currently the token economy is non existent in Cardano but in 6 months it could be thriving so it will need a stablecoin.  
It would be possible to create a new stablecoin, but why not leverage whats already there.",NO

16/Sep/20 10:36 PM,319171,258,anthony,"Small stake pool are having a hard time getting to a point where they can constantly make blocks. I have an idea that could help change that.

I believe there are plenty of people out there with ada who would like to delegate to smaller pools. The problem is a visibility issue:

*   If there are 20 holders that have 200,000 ada each and they want to delegate to a small pool. Together they control 4 million ada and that would be enough to delegate to a small pool and probably push that pool into the 2-3 block per epoch average.
*   the problem is that they don't see or know each other and independently they are not going to delegate to a small pool because 200,000 ada will not put a small pool into a place where they can be sure to average at least one block per epoch. In fact, at the time I am writing this, 6 block producing epochs has passed and there are plenty of pools with more then 200,000 ada that have not minted a single block
*   The solution is to find a way these holders can find each other and come to an agreement to delegate their ada to a specific small pool. Once an agreement has been made by each holder, they all delegate their ada to the small pool in the next epoch. If an agreement is not reached or there are not enough holders to delegate their ada, They keep their ada where it is until there are enough holders to delegate to the small pool.In essence, we are providing a place for holders to ""promise to delegate"" when a specific ada threshold is met. This will allow the holders who would rather be with a smaller pool an opportunity to do that without missing out on rewards. This helps the small pool owners get to a point where they are averaging at least 1-2 blocks per epoch… They can grow from there on there own.

  

The question now is how do we do this?

I am proposing a youtube channel road tour. Every two weeks you go to a different state or country and have a show with the small stake pool operators from that area. You ask the community to help promote the show. I would approach IOG, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation.

During the show we will promote a website where holders could pick the small stake pool and add their name to a ""promise to delegate"" list and when the list has enough holders to delegate to the pool, they fulfill their promise and delegate during the next epoch.

This make take some time to grow and gain popularity but by the time this proposal is viewed and voted on, There will have been advertising for about 3 months. There should be a good base by that time. I believe we will get good publicity. Everyone in the community wants to see all the stake pools succeed in order to fully decentralize Cardano. We, as a community, do not want to leave any stake pool behind.",NO

16/Sep/20 9:49 PM,319132,237,Nick OLEUM Stakepool,"Apprentice system implies someone working closely with a mentor and producing real things along the way as they learn more and more.  
A system where projects under development offer apprenticeship to people new into development of dApps could fulfill the objective of more learners becoming proficient and reward those learners on their journey. Maybe a proportion of their funding is contingent on educating a number of apprentices.",NO
16/Sep/20 9:38 PM,319132,237,James Dunseith,"I'm glad you're thinking about this, Nick. To generalize, we need incentives to get people learning and engaged on the platform. Paying people might be a way to do this, but that approach can come with drawbacks. Using too many carrots can create confusion about the value of a carrot.

When something is new and promising, that can create intrinsic motivation. Can we tell the story of Cardano and what it can do in a way that helps people see themselves as someone who can participate?

Can we create an apprentice system that allows for people to get paid soon for making real contributions while continuing to learn? Can we create incubators that provide education programming alongside dapp and business development?",NO

Lets turn this on its head and pay then to learn. Would need some kind of proficiency proof in order to be paid. Just a first thought.",NO
