    "outcomeObjectives": null,
    "description": "**TL;DR** This will allow your wallet & Cardano apps to send & interpret links like this:\n\n*web+cardano://stake?COSD* (a single pool)\n\n*web+cardano://stake?IOG1&OCEAN&EMUR1* (a equal weighted portfolio)\n\n*web+cardano://stake?CRAB=30.14&MYTH=20.84&NINJA=20.04&HYPE=17.80&MARLN=16.92&KINGS=16.81&COSD=15.62&RAID3=15.32&ZOE=15.20&XORN=14.93* (real life example of a precisely weighted, crowdsourced delegation portfolio: as it would have been generated by a top-10 ROA snapshot on 22 September)\n\n**Why should we care?** The 90% of stake pools who currently have very little chance to survive with the current ranking system, who currently have to share less than 1% of delegated Ada, will now have a way for the world to know about them, and to join and suggest \"community\" portfolios based on common interests and values.\n\n**Why do we need to spread out the delegation? Don't we have a proper system from only the biggest pools?** Think of Cardano when DeFi hits it like it has Ethereum, and then imagine if K (currently 150) stake pools will be enough to handle a load that could increase 100-fold literally overnight, as we have seen happen with one DeFi app and Ethereum based token after another.\n\nA growing Cardano blockchain, facing a likely sudden increase in load within the year from the introduction of Smart Contract applications (not just DeFi!), needs to more rigorously maintain its goal of decentralisation by distributing the balance of rewards, network/computing power, training, and operational knowledge among an increasingly larger group of operators. Otherwise that sudden increase may require an equally sudden rise in K to a much greater figure without having at least that number of high-quality pools.\n\n**Who should be most interested in this proposal?**\n\nIOHK / Emurgo developers working on multi-pool wallet delegation in Cardano, but lacking a standard of how people might use it effectively, especially as demands arrive for to accommodate \"crowdsourced\" delegation lists\n\nLarge stake pool owners and their delegates currently using contrived means (e.g. lists of ticker symbols on Twitter) to suggest alternatives as their pools repeatedly face saturation\n\nSmall stake pool owners unable to find adequate delegation from the community according to their peer relationships or distinctive qualities\n\nCardano supporters & Ada holders concerned that the unabated trend of stake centralisation to only \"K\" (currently 150) virtually saturated pools are both a present and future vulnerability\n\nFoundation members & marketers working to maintain the public perception of Cardano as the world's most promising decentralised cryptocurrency\n\n**Who will benefit from this Proposal? Everybody…** specifically:\n\n**small pools** : making it easier for potential delegators to find individual pools, while pool ranking sites may always favour the most heavily delegated pools (even when saturated, since many users simply follow brand recognition) and those with the greatest (now impassable) numbers of produced blocks\n\n**medium sized pools** : supporting inclusion in third-party delegation lists, therefore helping users find delegation without the prejudice of ranking algorithms advantageous only to the K largest stake pools (see concurrent CIP proposal \"Non-Centralizing Rankings\")\n\n**large pools** : providing to superfluous delegators a simple & effective exit strategy when nearing or passing the saturation point (currently done mostly through the error-prone, easily subverted medium of social networking)\n\n**communities of pools** : i.e. special interest, self-organising, union-formed, or democratically established peer groups, formed according to these criteria and more… *merit-based* (community or infrastructure contribution); *community-based* (geographical, technological, or other affiliation); *need-based* (to help the smallest pools achieve block eligibility / sustainability); *charity-based* (with verified humanitarian distribution of rewards)\n\n**automation & integration** : allowing portfolio links to be generated through novel means by a greater variety of new & third party web sites, scripts & software tools, and checking real and hypothetical portfolios for past results and anticipated performance\n\n**delegators** : having an alternative to picking only the \"top of the boards,\" often losing rewards due to inevitable pool saturation… eventually having a rich ecosystem of alternatives beyond whatever staking portfolios may be curated & integrated into the wallet by central authorities.\n\n**Hasn't anyone talked about this before?** \"Delegation Portfolios\" have been promised but nobody in my circle knows when this might be coming & to what extend it might be decentralised. CH himself mentioned the term \"curation\" in a seminal video about the subject this implies these delegation portfolios would only be available from a centralised source. So yes and no.\n\n*… you mean, talked about this proposal specifically?* Yes, it's been submitted as a CIP at the GitHub link below a few days in advance of the Fund2 deadline. Some of these sources are better for detailed reading about the subject, since it's impossible to submit anything that looks good on Ideascale (the UI for formatting is horrible). So please post your questions here (as they relate to the Catalyst fund) as well as on the following discussion links for the related CIP:\n\nhttps://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-stake-uri-scheme-for-pools-delegation-portfolios/40594\n\n**The budget** reflects that neither I nor anyone else has developed related code, and the organisational requirements are open-ended and probably daunting. This work would not be based on any existing businesses and has no other potential for income… it would effectively be a part-time salary as a ***project manager*** to, at least:\n\n\\- oversee the implementation of this idea by Daedalus & Yoroi developers at IOHK & Emurgo, suggesting and contributing code & UI recommendations as necessary\n\n\\- write all standards documentation for the URI implementation, with support for alternatives like JSON files\n\n\\- liaison with managers of external web sites implementing the portfolio standard: e.g. exchanges supporting Cardano staking and Cardano pool ranking sites.\n\n\\- write a \"portfolio generation page\" to test this idea by processing the JSON data from AdaPools.org for instance to develop portfolio links based on selected criteria, to be determined by popular demand.\n\n**BUDGET & RESPONSIBILITY DETAILS (developed through comment dialogue below)** \\[edits from those comments in brackets\\]\n\n**1 -** First of all, the budget for this project could actually be zero \\[*and should at least be considered **flexible***\\] if this implementation is accepted as a Cardano Improvement Proposal. We still don't know what the timetable for implementing these CIPs will be and we may have to wait for Governance to be achieved on Cardano before people can really vote on them. You can follow the discussion about that proposal here:\n\nhttps://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-stake-uri-scheme-for-pools-delegation-portfolios/40594\n\n… and with eventual participation from the developers this is the best place to ask questions about the schedule & contingency issues I'm trying to anticipate & describe below.\n\nThe budget, which I've assumed is an estimate pending final approval and vote, should be enough for six months of daily (half-time?) work to:\n\n\\- communicate daily with IOG and/or Emurgo developers as the necessary issues for implementing the URI standard in Daedalus and Yoroi are created and progressed.\n\n\\- anticipate integration issues with other software and tools (e.g. hardware wallets that operate through a browser and also need to support the same URI syntax).\n\n\\- develop an API document for the URI standard, with implementation guidelines for various software environments, to be used by outside developers.\n\nI'm not including \"community outreach\" in this list because: if the related CIP and/or this Catalyst proposal are accepted by the community, we can assume the community itself will find ways of utilising the URI standard however it might develop. If and when suggestions come in spontaneously, I will catalogue them so they can be considered by the developers.\n\nComments made on the CIP, which have recently begun to come in, will help identify integration issues (wallets, operating systems, mobile phone environments) which will serve as checklist items to run through daily until met as much as possible. The best we can hope for is that the major wallets like Daedalus, Yoroi and perhaps the most compliant exchanges supporting Cardano staking will implement this standard… then the rest of them can be relied upon to follow suit.\n\nLeading into answer #2 below, I estimate a 6-month implementation period to cover the major implementations, for which a part-time salary of ₳10K ada per month (currently $1000) will cover the vast number of variables as best as possible. I think it's reasonable to focus on Daedalus, Yoroi, a representative exchange, and the most popular hardware wallet and cover the rest as time permits.\n\nAgain, since this proposal is mainly to open a door to discussion with IOG, Emurgo and the Cardano Foundation, I have no idea in which direction the responsibility could be established… I doubt Cardano wallet developers would take \"orders\" from an outside agent, so the best we could hope for is that I would catalogue the integration issues, document then rigorously on Github and in other company communications, and make sure they are progressed in order for the URIs to be implemented as early in that 6-month schedule as possible.\n\nThe six-month target, if it were to begin with the Fund2 disbursement, might correspond closely to the point at which Cardano PoS is fully decentralised (d = 0). At that point we will have a true picture of how greatly the stake will be concentrated without any incentives or tools for decentralising that stake. We should also be launching DeFi applications at that point, with Cardano taking on the load that is currently crippling Ethereum.\n\nThat should not be the point at which people suddenly start thinking about how to decentralise rewards, profitability & productivity among a wider variety of SPOs. At least with this proposal we will have at least one way, hopefully ready before that date & in 6 months at the latest, to make it as easy as possible for the community & network to redistribute stake.\n\nIf there is person or team in IOG / Emurgo / CF who will step forward and say they have that same responsibility, that would be good enough for me… all they'd need to do is publicly commit to that responsibility and then we wouldn't need this proposal. Until such a commitment is made, this proposal arranges for such a person to be there.\n\n**2 -** For the second question, the support of multi-pool delegation in Cardano wallets is a strict dependency of this proposal. I've attempted to get some clarity about this issue in this very recent comment, from perhaps the best source of information out there. The time relationships as I see it are:\n\na) If we wait for a full implementation of multi-pool delegation (in Daedalus first I would think), it will be provided as before in a monolithic means without any support for community-produced delegation lists. This proposal is a way of forcing consideration of the issue by wallet developers even though it cannot be implemented under the current conditions. If we wait for the UI and integration to be worked out without community input in favour of crowdsourced delegation portfolios, it'll be too late.\n\nb) If the timing isn't right, and the presumed 6-month lifecycle of this project begins before that prerequisite is met, the funding should be held in abeyance, OR (I would hope not) the project would be cancelled and would have to apply for funding all over again, OR in the intervening period the wallet software developers will realise the vital importance of this feature and will implement it at their own expense with the full resources of IOG / Emurgo behind them.\n\n**3 -** None of these questions can be answered precisely without knowing how quickly developers at IOG and/or Emurgo could implement this on their own initiative, how they perceive the need for user-generated delegation portfolios (if at all), and whether their developers could work with a developer or project manager outside their organisation. The biggest variable is how much those companies are willing to communicate about the issue.\n\nMy worry is that they might not, and I hope I am wrong… it's anticipating that worst case scenario that this proposal is here, so the community can vote to insist upon on this feature as a priority, should the CIP and all other methods fail. The budget cannot be any more than a guess until we know what level of cooperation we would eventually have.\n\n**Prerequisites**: Some support in wallets & exchanges for multi-pool delegation. If these are not achieved before the beginning of this proposal work period, the project may change in scope depending upon how the delegation UI works in these applications.",

    "description": "We need users and developers - so let's get funky.  \n  \nEnabling a library to easily sign Cardano transactions via Arduino IDE is a good way to encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build. Arduino is of the most popular embedded development IDE platforms and enabled rapid hardware / software prototyping and deployment. Building out a library as an open Arduino-compatible library provides embedded developers a simple solution to easily integrate signing Cardano transactions into their applications..  \n  \nUsing the Arduino compatible library, developers can implement application-specific tools and products involving local transaction signing or signing message data to attract user participation and engagement. Users can benefit from using products and services and or monetize their own services or data ip.\n\nThis can help provide Cardano's unbanked people with an economic identity in the sense of enabling them to benefit from the economic opportunities entailed via deployment of products and services which utilize this library.  \n  \nAs example, creating an embedded Arduino-compatible C library to sign Cardano transactions would enable integrating transaction signing into individual embedded IoT devices. This will enable IoT devices to purchase upgrades and sign IoT data payloads using an embedded private key which can be used as a token incentive model (pair with data marketplace / DMP on the backend to monetize).  \n  \nI have an open hardware project - Adosia IoT. The current state of the platform is and end-to-end platform to connect, customize, deploy and manage IoT devices. When users connect a new device, a token lottery is conducted granting users a random number of tokens which can be used for on-platform upgrade services, device enhancements, or withdrawn wen Goguen (smart contract will involve p2p marketplace for users to monetize IoT data profiles).  \n\nFor Adosia's purposes, we will deliver an open library and example code where we enable users to add a private key to their embedded device via our Phoenix Connect Script (currently located here: https://github.com/adosia/adosia-iot/tree/master/adosia_phoenix ):  \n  \n\nDelivery will occur within 2-3 months following receipt of funding.\n\nUseful links:\n\nAdosia Home:  \nhttps://adosia.com\n\n  \n\nAdosia Learn (check the token part!):\n\nhttps://adosia.com/faq.php\n\n  \n\nAdosia Git:  \nhttps://github.com/adosia/adosia-iot\n\nAdosia YouTube:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCozulBTa3-zuyMQMCvhGbKA\n\nAdosia IoT Store:  \nhttps://adosia.io",

    "description": "**GOAL**\n\nThe goal of this work would be to develop a resource to support and serve as a reference for marketers and other proposals, so they can be more informed about what would attract blockchain entrepreneurs and developers to Cardano, thus helping develop more efficient marketing strategies.\n\nIt is important to deliver this resource fast, so marketers and other proposers working to address the challenge in Fund2 can take advantage of it. Therefore my intention is to prioritize speed over size, working full time to have the results delivered in just 1 month.\n\n  \n\n**SCOPE**\n\nThis work could well be the first phase of a bigger project including a second step where the knowledge gained is applied to more efficiently attract talent to the ecosystem. Instead, I find it more useful to modularize it, so it produces a result on its own that can be shared, adding value to more than one project.\n\n  \n\n**METHODOLOGY**\n\nI believe the best way to understand what the feelings of blockchain entrepreneurs and developers are is to directly ask them. Therefore performing interviews and carrying out surveys would be the backbone of this work.\n\n  \n\n**SUGGESTED PROCESS AND TIMELINE**\n\n++Week 1 (Project Start Date: 21/11/2020)++\n\n\\-Purpose: Build a database of developers and businesses.\n\n\\-Value added: Define which individuals will take part of the project as potential sources of information.\n\n\\-Methodology: Identify contactable people building on blockchain through social networks like LinkedIn.\n\n\\-Metrics: I have already tested and estimated that the average time required to briefly research on each individual (and the company they are working for) and see if they are a valid candidate for the database is ~15 minutes. Therefore I aim to add 4 individuals per hour to the database, so by the end of a 50 hours week there are a total of 200 entries in the database.\n\n++Week 2++\n\n\\-Purpose: Get first-hand insights.\n\n\\-Value added: Shaping the general understanding of the opinions and feelings involved, improving the quality of the questions to be asked and helping create different profiles to better segment and analyze answers.\n\n\\-Methodology: Contact people in the database and casually chat with a diverse sample of them (different countries, experience, magnitude of projects, …)\n\n\\-Metrics: Aiming to successfully interview at least 10% of the database, i.e. 20 individuals.\n\n++Week 3++\n\n\\-Purpose: Generalize results.\n\n\\-Value added: Lower the bias of the information received so far, so it becomes more reliable.\n\n\\-Methodology: Based on the information gathered in the previous week, develop a refined questionnaire and send it to all the remaining people in the database.\n\n\\- Metrics: Aiming to successfully receive answers from at least another 15% of the database, i.e. 30 individuals more.\n\n++Week 4++\n\n\\-Purpose: Consolidate results and write a deliverable document to be publicly shared.\n\n\\-Value added: Help people trying to reach potential new entrepreneurs and devs to attract them to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n\\-Methodology: The format of the document will largely depend of the kind of information received, so it can be most useful.\n\n  \n\n**RISKS**\n\nThe main risk is getting a lower response rate than expected (i.e. less than 25%). In that case, an extra Week 5 would be added to the timeline, to try to match the metrics discussed above.\n\n  \n\n**ACCOUNTABILITY**\n\nIt will be possible to follow the progress of the project, and even commenting on my work (suggestions are appreciated), checking the following spreadsheet:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VczgpfeYK8Oib9qS-IBYamx0_v4MwB_CpFIqEMeSwLI/edit?usp=sharing\n\n  \n\n**FUNDS**\n\n12,500 ADA are requested to cover 1 month of full-time dedication to the project (50 hours/week x 4 weeks).",

Also, learning a new language for writing Smart Contracts in Cardano is hard, and it will take time for the newcomers to get used to it.\n\n  \n\n**++The solution to the Problem++**\n\nWe want to build a standardized converter from Ethereum-based ERC-\\* smart contracts to the Cardano-based smart contracts. There are many standardized ERC-\\* tokens, most known is the ERC-20 standard representing FT - fungible tokens. We will create one REST API endpoint at Tatum, which will convert existing Ethereum ERC-20 FT to the Cardano-compatible ERC-20 FT. All parameters like name, supply, etc. will be preserved. By this, we can convert any ERC standard token to the Cardano.\n\n  \n\n**++Relevant Experience++**\n\nTatum is an open-source middleware that helps developers to become a blockchain developer. Any developer can become a blockchain developer in a couple of hours instead of months/years. Tatum was founded almost four years ago and currently supports more than 20 blockchains/tokens, and more are to come in the next months. Tatum helps developers build blockchain apps without any previous knowledge of the blockchain. To achieve that, Tatum creates dozens of pre-built features and functionalities, making the development much more uncomplicated.\n\n  \n\n**++Detailed Plan++**\n\nTatum will add Cardano as another supported blockchain in the platform. This will enable any developer to work with Cardano and use it in its apps.\n\nAfter adding Cardano and Cardano to announce Smart Contracts support, Tatum will create a REST API converter.\n\nTatum is an API platform. It has multiple open source tools like libraries for different languages (JavaScript, Java/Kotlin, and more to come), CLI tool, custom Key Management System, or Middleware API for even more comfortable developer experience. All these tools will be enhanced with Cardano and Converter functionalities.\n\n  \n\n**++Purpose of using funds++**\n\nAdd Cardano to the Tatum and reach out to the developers, who currently do not use it as its first-choice blockchain.\n\nCreate educational materials, blog posts, marketing initiatives, etc. to attract more developers.\n\nWork on the online simple 1 API-call Smart Contract converter.\n\n  \n\n**++Specific goals++**\n\nOur main goal is to make the Cardano development community bigger. More developers mean more apps and more significant adoption.\n\nMost of the devs use only standard ERC-\\* tokens with no custom additions, so they do not need to spend months learning the new language and findings bugs in their contracts. Our Converter will save a lot of time and money for the devs and the teams.\n\n  \n\n**++Funding++**\n\nWe are seeking 260k ADA for the following tasks:\n\n*   Add Cardano to the Tatum Platform - 20 000 ADA\n*   Infrastructure and operational costs of running Cardano nodes, development and testing on-chain - 30 000 ADA\n*   Create Converter logic - 100 000 ADA\n*   Add to the Tatum Platform API - 30 000 ADA\n*   Add to the open-source libraries and tools - 50 000 ADA\n*   Marketing and educational materials, blog posts, etc. - 30 000 ADA\n\n  \n\n**++Timeline++**\n\nThere are two stages of the project:\n\n1\\.

    "title": "Credmark Credit Score",
    "problemDescription": "No financial system can exist without credit. Credit cannot be extended without credit data. Crypto credit doesn't exist.",
    "solutionDescription": "Credmark uses crypto credit events to produce credit data for blockchain addresses. This provides credit for both DeFi and CeFi products.",
    "outcomeObjectives": null,
    "description": "\\== For developers / fintech people ==\n\nWe are using all credit events generated in the crypto spaces to produce credit data for all blockchain addresses. We support anonymous/pseudonymous, and KYCed use-cases. We work cross-chain so our credit data on Cardano will benefit from activity on Ethereum and Bitcoin, thereby quickly bootstrapping an environment capable of hosting financial services that require credit data.  \n\nWe currently have a consumer credit product in production and are working on developing a corporate/bond rating product.\n\nWithout credit data loan product developers are severely constrained. The only way they can manage default risk is by over-collateralizing every loan. This in turn limits the market of potential users to traders and speculators.\n\nWith credit data developers can design products that:\n\n1\\. require less than full collateralization,\n\n2\\. allow variable liquidation grace periods, and\n\n3\\. allow variable rates based on borrower's past behavior.\n\nThese products will appeal to a far greater audience.\n\n\\== For normal people ==\n\nYou've probably heard there's a lot of lending going on in crypto. It's pretty big and it's growing fast. (If you want details you might want to read the crypto credit report we produce every quarter. It provides the best snapshot of the industry. This is the latest: https://reports.credmark.com/TheCryptoCreditReport-q2-2020.pdf.\n\nThe problem with all this lending is that it's over-collateralized. This means that if you want to borrow x (say 1 BTC or 10,000 USD), you need to provide 1.5-2x as collateral. Why would anyone do that? Normal people wouldn't, but for traders it can sometimes make a lot of sense.\n\nThe collateral ensures that the lenders don't lose their shirt if the borrower doesn't repay the loan. You can think of collateral as a very crude way of mitigating default risk.\n\nThe other way that lenders mitigate risk is by evaluating the trustworthiness of the borrower. If it's a personal relationship, it's easy. I wouldn't lend my uncle money because I know he's a deadbeat, but I'd happily lend my Dad money because he's super reliable and sticks to his word. Unfortunately, in most cases lenders don't know the borrowers, at least not personally. In those cases they need to rely on data that indicates the trustworthiness of the borrower. That's what credit scores are. They are neatly-packaged trust indicators. A credit score is the culmination of the analysis of thousands of pieces of data. Pretty sophisticated stuff but absolutely necessary in any well-functioning financial system. Without credit life would be very different.  \n\nSo why is Credmark re-inventing the wheel? Why can't crypto lenders just use a normal credit score? The first problem is that crypto is global, but credit scores are local. An American credit score isn't valid in Singapore. In fact a lender in Singapore might not even know what it means. Given the number of jurisdictions, trying to use local data to provide a global service is far from ideal. The second problem is that a lot of lending is done anonymously. No one knows who's borrowing and lending through all these DeFi protocols.  \n\nUsing a mix of collateral and credit data, we can allow normal people to borrow in the crypto space. This is a massive improvement over our current situation. Credmark is working with lenders on Ethereum to build these new loan products. We are convinced that a lot of liquidity is going to move to Cardano quickly, and we want to be in a position to support emerging lending products right away.\n\n\\== Budget ==\n\nWe are asking for 500K ADA because we have a good idea of how much work this will involve. We need to:\n\n1\\. Integrate with Cardano\n\n2\\. Build out cross-chain clusters (so that credit data from Ethereum address clusters, for example, can be associated with Cardano address clusters)\n\n3 Integrate with Cardano oracle pools.\n\nWe estimate that this will require 9 months of developer work, which costs us about $112K. The requested amount covers less that 1/2 of that but we have been planning to invest in a Cardano solution, so are more than happy to contribute the remainder of the budget.",

    "problemDescription": "The Cardano blockchain is not widely adopted and there needs to be leading examples of how to apply decentralized Apps on it.",
    "solutionDescription": "We propose a simple turn-based multiplayer RPG whose game rules and assets are governed entirely by blockchain metadata.",
    "outcomeObjectives": null,
    "description": "The idea is to have the entire game state on the blockchain. There would be a ledger containing the entirety of the game state, like map, NPC, levels/locations, monsters, items/equipment, character classes, etc.\n\nPlayers would interact with the information from the master ledger to move to different levels, interact with monsters, and NPCs. Validity of actions would be checked against the master ledger and rules will be implement by smart contracts to ensure validity of player actions.\n\nIn the event of bugs or hacks, a new master ledger to update game state can be introduced for players to migrate to, or they can still choose to play on the old master ledger, since it will always exist in the blockchain.\n\n**++Refinement v1.1++**\n\n**++Purpose:++** To encourage adoption of Cardano and dApps on blockchain, show-case the features and benefits of blockchain technology with a Turn-based multiplayer RPG\n\n**++How can Blockchain affect Gaming?++**\n\nThe idea of blockchain is decentralized consensus of a chain of data, where this data shall persist forever and where anyone can add data to it, so long as the consensus is always met. This proposal shall try to draw out the benefits of persistent data and decentralization on the blockchain as the main feature to emphasize within the game's framework.\n\nEvolving and persistent data on the blockchain should have value, as it is evidence of a player's progression in the game. Tokenizing this progression to give it value is important.\n\n**++Decentralized Gaming Objectives++**\n\n\\- The game should not have an overseeing central entity that administrates the game. Therefore, the game's rules and assets should be defined upfront and be used as a \"genesis block\" to define the game's rules and assets. Assets shall include definitions for things like all the abilities, items, classes, and locations to the game.\n\n\\- The game state for each player are built from assets from the \"genesis block\", like starting items, abilities, etc.\n\n\\- The game shall be self-governed by players within the rules of the game. Smart contracts shall be utilized to verify the validity of actions within the game along with the \"genesis block\"\n\n\\- Players shall submit transactions whenever they wish to interact with assets from the game to build their game state. Transactions are unique to a player, since a wallet and private key will be needed to sign the transactions.\n\n**++Visualization of the Game, Playing the Game++**\n\nSince the genesis block and game state all reside on the chain, any person can technically query the blockchain for this data and build a visualization of the game, and play the game by submitting valid transactions to the blockchain.\n\nA server would query the blockchain for information about the game's assets, and be able to link those assets to visuals on the screen. To service a particular player, the server would need to know what the player's unique identifier is, to query and obtain the latest tip of their game state. Knowing the latest tip of the game state, the player can then execute transactions to perform actions like \"Monster Encounter\", or \"Travel to Location\", or whatever action the game's rules allow, to evolve their respective game state.\n\nThe above description is laid out in the attached block diagram.\n\n**++Proof-of-Concept Plan++**\n\nThe game's front-end will be through a web application. The assets for the PoC shall be 2D and/or text-based. The main goal is to show-case a decentralized self-governing game where a player's every action shall be stored on the blockchain to build their game state.\n\nDevelopment of the Proof-of-Concept will have two stages.\n\n**++PoC Stage 1 (3 months, $15k USD)++**\n\nThe stage 1 proof-of-concept demonstration will try to showcase:\n\n1\\. Decentralized battle encounters that are initiated by players.\n\n2\\. Battle encounter outcome resolution and game state update for players that are participating.\n\n3\\. Web-based front-end interface to perform the decentralized gaming transactions for battle actions, which update the game state.\n\n4\\. Basic assets to the game just to perform simple gaming actions. Players will be able to select one or two classes, while be able to fight one or two types of monsters.\n\n**++PoC Stage 2 (3 months, $15k USD)++**\n\n1\\. Tokenization of battle rewards and items\n\n2\\. Scalable battle system within the battle encounters. We want players to have a fruitful experience with executing fewer actions, so Tx costs are not overrunning.\n\n3\\. More assets to the game plus actual design on the game, its starting mechanics and progression\n\n**++Things Currently in Progress++**\n\n\\- Evaluating smart contracts for game core data, battle encounters, and player creation/progression. Use this to fleshing out high-level full stack block diagram for gaming framework\n\n\\- Scoping development of front-end interface: wallet, creating and signing transactions and/or smart contracts\n\n\\- Ramp-up on the Plutus Playground\n\n**++Funding Request++**\n\nThe cost of software development would be $60K USD for both stages of the proof-of-concept and would go towards:\n\n1\\. Costs for software development. Hiring an additional part-time engineer to develop.\n\n2\\. Server costs for webhosting to distribute the web interface for the game.",

    "solutionDescription": "Join Cardano Wallet-Lottery: 5₳ for free, win money, get a financial ID & support charity.\n\nWant more? Become active with Cardano!",
    "outcomeObjectives": null,
    "description": "++This idea is improved, thanks to the constructive comments below++\n\n**First some context**\n\n*How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?*\n\nBasically, people who are unaware of Cardano, shall not contribute. I believe that there are a huge group of potential developers that does not even know we exist. The wallet-lottery is aiming at three goals.\n\n1.  To create awareness and an accessible way for people to attend the wallet lottery. And by doing so creating a financial ID.\n2.  Within that group of attendees there are for sure developers who are then introduced into the wonderful world of Cardano. I will not be surprised if the first attendees consist mostly of technical oriented people. But I might be wrong in that assumption.\n3.  The wallet-lottery is a fundraiser for charities. Isn't it nice that we not only help participants in 3rd world countries to get easy access to a financial ID, but that they indirectly supporting/ improving their local environment due to activities of local active charities?\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAttached to the proposal is a schematic presentation. The proposal starts with the strategy of the wallet-lottery, complete with a numeric example. I elaborated on some points of the strategy.\n\nWe currently have a team of 4 people:\n\nErik Zevenbergen (me): entrepreneur: https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-zevenbergen-2936461/ (focus is Marketing and recruiting)\n\nPieter Nierop: entrepreneur, developer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pnierop/ (focus is Marketing and development)\n\nIngmar Matthezing: entrepreneur, developer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingmarm/ (focus is architecture and development)\n\nTom Breuker: entrepreneur: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tombreuker/ (focus is Marketing and recruiting)\n\n  \n\nAfter the strategy below, we go into the timeline of the proposal. The timeline is currently limited to the first 6 months. This is also the timeframe of the challenge.\n\nFinally, finance. I will explain the funding and the pledging/investing. Both are given a \"reward\" based upon the wager-stakes. More important, how is that ADA spend. And how the wallet-lottery is self-sustainable after 6 months.\n\n**Strategy of the Wallet-lottery**\n\nThe purpose is to get 2 million participants within the first 6 months. To do that we will recruit a salesforce of about 50 people in areas with low penetration of financial ID's. To motivate locals to participate in the Wallet-lottery and create a financial ID, we motivate them with a 5ADA giveaway that can only be spent on the Wallet-lottery.\n\nAlso there should be a possibility for people to join via mobile phone, taking also into consideration that the internet connection can be bad.\n\n1.  Currency is ADA (this can later extend to other currencies when interoperability on Cardano is realized)\n2.  The address of the wallet used for paying the wager is the entering the lottery. Winnings are directly returned to that same wallet (to be regulated with smart contracts).\n3.  50% of the wager stakes goes to charity. Focus is on charity that (among other things) focus on bringing internet connection to the people in 3rd world countries\n4.  35% of the wager stakes goes into prizes\n5.  1% of the wager stakes is distributed as ROI among pledgers\n6.  0.04% of the wager stakes is contributed to the treasury (as a ROI of the funding).\n7.  13.96% of the wager stakes is for covering the operational costs (marketing, accounting, charity management, ambassadors (PR), HR).\n\nFocus is 3rd world countries. Object is to create awareness for blockchain applications and the advantage of having a financial ID. The lottery should act as a trigger for people to create a wallet. Once they see the advantages, the accessibility to more (useful) applications is increased.\n\n*Numeric example*\n\n*   Wager stakes 100,000,000.00 per month 1,200,000,000.00 p/y\n*   Charities 50% 50,000,000.00 is 600,000,000.00 p/y\n*   Prizes 35.00% 35,000,000.00 is 420,000,000.00 p/y\n*   Operational costs 13.96% 13,960,000.00 is 167,520,000.00 p/y\n*   Reward for pledgers 1.00% 1,000,000.00 is 12,000,000.00 p/y\n*   Reward for treasury 0.04% 40.000 is 480.000 p/y\n\n*Some elaboration on the strategy*\n\n++Ad 3. 50% of the wager stakes goes to charities++\n\nEveryone can recommend charities. Charities will be ranked in order by the community (voting) Ranking decides the ratio of donations (to be decided)\n\n++Ad 4. 35% goes into prizes++\n\nThere is a fixed prize-model. (to be decided)\n\nExample of a prize-model (with the aim for people to keep participating):\n\n*   Fixed larger prize (0.1% of the wager stakes) every month (from the example: 120,000,000.00 each time 14,400,000.00 p/y)\n*   Fixed smaller prize (0.025% of the wager stake) every week (300,000.000 each time 15,600,000.000 p/y)\n*   10 times a game in a game: prize 0.5% of the wager stakes (6,000,000.00 each time 60,000,000.00 p/y)\n*   4 large prizes (2% of wager stake) per year (24,000,000.00 each time 96,000,000.00 p/y)\n*   2 time a year a prize of 10% (120,000,000.00 each time 240,000,000.00 p/y)\n\nAdditionally there also might be extra small unanounced prizes as an extra incentive. E.g. 10 - 50 ADA)\n\n++Ad 5) 1% of the wager stakes is distributed as ROI among pledgers++\n\nWe want to motivate every new participant (without a financial ID) with 5 ADA. These 5 ADA can only be spent on participation of the wallet-lottery. Given that one round in the Wallet-lottery cost 1 ADA, they can participate 4 times (given the transaction fees). Since we aim at 2 million participants (in 6 months) we need 10 million ADA pledged of invested. Also see the Financials.\n\n++Ad 6) 0.04% of the wager stakes is contributed to the treasury++\n\nThe 0.04% is related to the 400.000 ADA funding in relation to the 1% reward to the 10 million pledged/invested. Also see the Financials\n\n  \n\n**Timeline**\n\nBelow you find the timeline for the first six months. After month six it is the roll-out of the Wallet-lottery\n\n*   Month 1 – 3  \n    Recruiting the 50 local marketeers / sales force in Asia and/or Africa.\n    \n*   Month 3 – 6  \n    Local marketeers / sales force persuading locals to create a wallet for the lottery. I am thinking of giving every attendee an incentive of 5 ADA, only to be spend on the wallet-lottery (smart contract). People without a financial ID are mostly poor. A small incentive can get us a great way.  \n    The wallet-lottery will cost 1 ADA to attend. Meaning they can participate 4 times and hopefully find enough motivation to continue afterwards. With 50 local marketeers/salesforce we aim at about 1 to 2,000,000 attendees in 6 months. Cost: 10 million ADA (hence the pledgers/investors).\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n*   Month 1 - 3  \n    Writing the marketing plan and building the app. We have 2 experienced programmers now studying Haskell, Plutus, Marlowe. I have applied for testing Marlowe, since I am also a SME on finance. However it would be great to get support from within our community!\n    \n*   Months 4 -6  \n    Testing, testing, testing\n    \n*   Month 7:  \n    Launch of the first wallet lottery (to be continued on a weekly basis)\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n**Finance of the proposal**\n\n*The first six months*\n\nThe first six months are focused on recruiting 50 salespeople to get 2 million locals to participate. Next to recruiting the 50 participants, we also need marketing material (including a website) and develop the Wallet-lottery.\n\n++Funding++\n\nThe requested funding is 400.000 ADA. The funding is to cover the first six months in the following way:\n\n*   200.000 ADA for salesforce salaries:  \n    Bases upon experience in Asia, we believe that a local recruiter/marketeer/salesforce should be awarded with about 100 USD per month. A salesforce of 50 person, for 4 months equals 20.000 USD. Given the current price of ADA, that means about 200.000 ADA.  \n    Note: probably we can make a smart contract to regulate the pay-out to local marketeers. E.g. in the beginning a salary related to the number of applicants. Later changed to: active new participants (paying 1 ADA per week) should be higher than X to pay out the salary? I am sure people can come up with a smarter way.\n\n  \n\n*   200.000 ADA for development of the Wallet-lottery and marketing material.  \n    We want the maximum cost of development to equal the cost of sales. The real development cost will be higher.  \n    The 200.000 ADA is also used to create a pilot to attract more pledgers/investors.\n\n++Pledging / investing (not funding)++\n\nI do not know the correct wording: pledging or investing? The money should come from pledgers/investors in our community. The total amount we are looking for is 10,000,000 ADA\n\n*   We want to motivate 2 million people with 5ADA each to join the Wallet-lottery. This is will be pledged or invested by our community, not funded out of the treasury. The reward is 1% of the wager stakes every week.\n\n*Month 7 and further (self-sustainability)*\n\nAfter the wallet is ready, the Wallet-lottery should be self-funded. 13.96% of the weekly wager stakes is allocated to operational cost. The costs are to pay marketing, continuous improvement, financial control (accountancy) and management. This is open for discussion, but we are thinking of the following:\n\n*   Marketing: 50% (growing the participants)\n*   Finance: fixed fee to be negotiated\n*   Management: fixed fee to be decided by the community (voting)\n*   Development: the rest.\n\nPayment to management and finance should be fair. If people want to earn with the Wallet-lottery, they should pledge or invest in the 10 million. Of course, it is possible that in the future there will be multiple rounds for pledging/investing. This will be decided upon by vote.\n\nAfter six months the funding (and increasing) of the salesforce is based upon their own success. For the monthly salary we need 50.000 ADA for the initial 50 salespeople. That is also half of the operational cost. Since we have 4 Wallet-lotteries a month (approx.), we need only to cover 25.000 ADA per round (=13.96% per Wallet-lottery. With 180.000 weekly participants, we already cover that.\n\nWe aim at 2 million participants. The surplus is used to further increase the salesforce dramatically and to improve with further development and marketing tools\n\nImportant note:  \nThe percentages mentioned will all be discussed and voted upon. I can imagine a higher contribution to the treasury (5%?). The current 0.04% is based upon the original funding of 400,000ADA in relation to the 10,000,000ADA investing/pledging.",

    "description": "There is currently small competition for open source resource planning platforms.  \nCardano is a great place to start building ERP tools because of automated protocols (smart contracts) and decentralized immutable ledger.\n\nIn this ERP platform, we want to allow users to set up business operations with a simple login and without having to install anything.  \nAll the tools in the platform will have to have built-in user guides.  \nDocumentation has to built into the code, so it will be dynamically changing based on the tools you are using.\n\nWith this funding, I want to put together a potential team.  \nA plan on how to build the platform.  \nAnd finally, find at least 1 partner who is willing to integrate with the platform to solve their problem.\n\n**Roadmap - 3 weeks**  \nI am going to assemble a team to choose a tech stack on what we are going to build the platform on.  \nA good choice at the start will get us will the results faster and improves the adoption speed. However more in-depth analysis of the used technology and methods has to be done as the platform grows.\n\nI will set myself out to find answers like:  \nWhat tools are we going to use to build the platform?  \nHow these tools and products on the platform are going to be connected?  \nPlan out how are we going to connect the platform-tools with the IOHK products.  \nWhat information are we going to and can put in the blockchain?\n\nI have imagined building a development tool on Objective C and make it interpretable by different scripting languages to make it easily customizable for developers.\n\nA user interface should be made for the browser.\n\nSome tools have to be made in phone applications. (warehouse or production floor applications)\n\n**Cost of execution**  \nI can spare about 20 hours per week.  \nI assume it will take about 40 hours for each good tech stack overview.  \nI prefer to analyze at least 3 different tech stacks.  \nI would need help or hire someone with skills in documentation and analytics to get the research done in 3 weeks.  \nI will look for a consultation with different developers about different tech stacks.  \nI will organize free meetings and paid meetings if I have to.  \nThe potential cost for 3 weeks is 1800eur (assuming 15eur/h)  \nI estimate Consultation and organizing budget around 1000eur.\n\n**KPI**  \nHow many experienced developers there are for a specific language/tool? (GitHub statistics, blogs from google search)  \nWhat is the social media sentiment for specific tech stack words? (Reddit, Facebook)  \nHow do they allow for loose coupling?  \nHow easy it is to maintain consistency in data synchronization?  \nHow long it's expected for the tech stack to remain the same?  \nHow easy it is to learn? (Polled from the community)  \nHow well it is suited for agile development methods?  \nHow long it takes to create a minimum viable product? (We can think of any product examples, looking for something we can create under 6 weeks)\n\n  \n\n**Roadmap 6 weeks**  \nSearching for businesses that will be ready to improve their business operations and processes.\n\n**Cost of execution**\n\nI have a few contacts who are interested in using new tools to improve businesses.  \nFor a wider reach, I would use social media and create meetups.  \nI would assume about 60 hours spend on creating content, ads, booking, and events. (assuming 15eur/h)  \nWith a budget of around 1000 eur.  \nKeep in mind, I don't have marketing experience. Don't know how to estimate the marketing cost and time\n\n**KPI**\n\nHow many partners are ready to build dapps on the ERP platform? 2 is going to be a good start.  \nHow many partners are willing to integrate with the ERP platform? Taking the baby steps, at least 1 is the goal.\n\n  \n\n**Roadmap 12 weeks** - This process starts with Fund 4 (Fund 3 is skipped)  \nWe will create several different forms of documentation to enable the business process. It's time to start hiring full-time developers to build on the framework.\n\nProject detail document I used to explain the current situation and what it should be. Including high-level solutions that need to be done and who does them.  \nTechnical Documentation will include the information of all the functions required to be created.  \nA user guide is created to explain how to use the tool.  \nPlatform related documentation is constantly updated every time an open dapp is added.\n\n**Cost of execution**\n\nOnce we know how we are going to build.  \nWe can estimate the cost of creating the platform and required talent.  \nThe minimum team size will be realized from the tech stack research phase.  \nOnce we have the first problem to solve, we can estimate the cost of implementation\n\n**KPI**\n\nHow many documentation documents were made? (for every documentation type)  \nMost likely there is going to be documentations I have not even thought about, I will have an estimate of how many might we need after the tech stack research. For dapp documentation, I assume at least 4 (flowchart, tool overview/purpose, technical documentation, user guide)\n\nHow many likes and views documentation has?  \nI expect 80% of users using the dapp also open documentation and 20% of viewers to vote on the documentation.  \nHow many commits are developers doing in GIT?  \nI will try to estimate this after the team is formed and the dapp is planned.  \nHow many developers are currently creating funded tasks? Hoping for at least 2.\n\n  \n\n**Roadmap 24 weeks** This process starts with Fund 5  \nThere should be first useable products and processes usable and configurable on the platform.  \nThey should bring real-world value to the users.\n\n**KPI** I will add values for benchmarking after I have gone through the process of creating a minimum viable product.  \nHow many hours did each step take in a project? (documentations, meetings, development, testing, adoption)  \nWhat was the estimated time in hours to finish a project step?  \nWhat partners think of the added functions? Did it solve their problem?  \nHow many hours of new tasks partners allocate?  \nHow many new feature request is created?  \nHow many hours monthly the end product/process is used.  \nHow many hours are saved comparing to older products/processes?",

    "description": "The long-term goal of Tesseract is to bring dApps to any user that knows how to use a smartphone.\n\n\\==========================\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWhile mobile wallets are pretty common already, mobile dApps in the AppStores are still extremely rare due to the scarcity of developer tools.\n\nWe believe that the popularity of blockchain and dApps hugely depends on usability and availability on Mobile platforms.\n\nTesseract has started as a research project, focused on creating technology that allows zero-friction usability of dApps on Mobile and later the same year became a company funded by SOSV and Emurgo.\n\nAt the moment of writing the proposal, Tesseract protocol is already launched on iOS and allows creating web and native Ethereum dApps for iOS. Full implementation of Tesseract may take a while, but we believe that we already can bring value to the Cardano ecosystem by enabling iOS Cardano dApps now.\n\nWe acknowledge that the full integration of Cardano into Tesseract is too big for a single grant application and thus propose to split it into the phases, with the first phase to be the scope of the current grant. Each phase, along with the value it brings to the Cardano community is described below. Other phases describe our current vision of the next steps of how we can maximize the value that Tesseract can add to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n\\==========================\n\nLONG TERM PLAN\n\n1\\. Cardano Swift SDK - allows iOS developers to create native iOS dApps.\n\nA prerequisite for the integration of Cardano/Tesseract. The implementation is based on Cardano-rust and Cardano GraphQL, which is the official way to use Cardano. This phase is the subject of the current grant application and described in detail below.\n\n2\\. Integrate Cardano with Tesseract - Cardano dApps don't need to keep the private key anymore by gaining the capability to interact with wallets through Tesseract protocol. This approach brings the security and usability of Cardano dApps to a new level by eliminating the need to provide the private key to the dApp.\n\nWe will be ready for this milestone once we have the Swift SDKs. The integration itself is a separate subject and is not a part of this specific grant application.\n\n3\\. Android - Cardano Android dApps get the same benefits as the iOS dApps.\n\nHere we replicate what we've built and tested for the iOS community.\n\n\\==========================\n\nDETAILED PLAN FOR THE CARDANO SWIFT SDK\n\n\\[week 1\\] Library Core Architecture Implementation - project in GitHub, high-level architecture.\n\n\\[week 2-5\\] Cardano Core. This milestone is the core part of the Cardano client. Allows creating and managing private/public keys and communicating with Shelley APIs. This part is going to be based on https://github.com/Emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib implementation from Emurgo.\n\n\\[week 6-7\\] Cardano GraphQL. GraphQL is required for flexible data querying from Cardano blockchain, be it a simple balance read or advanced transaction details request. This milestone consists of covering available Cardano GraphQL APIs with Swift APIs.\n\n\\[week 8-11\\] Developer-friendly APIs with Cardano Core and GraphQL under the hood. Having GraphQL and Core wrapped is great, but it's not developer-friendly yet. In this milestone, we are covering up all \"exposed wires\" under the hood with Swift-style neat APIs available for rapid dApps development.\n\n\\[week 12\\] Key-provider APIs for easy private/public key management inside the dApp. This milestone allows integration with signers and key-providers, which is critical for further integration with Tesseract or any solution that keep private keys safe apart from the dApp.\n\n\\[week 13-14\\] Unit & integration tests - to keep quality consistent while doing future enhancements.\n\n\\[week 15-16\\] Docs and examples - demo dApp for Cardano + the documentation on how to use the Cardano Swift SDK.\n\n\\==========================\n\nTHANK YOU!\n\nWe are continuing the proposal refining based on your comments. Please, feel free to provide feedback and suggestions.\n\n\\====\n\nWhile we are planning to make Tesseract available for various Blockchains, we believe that Cardano is going to be one of the most suitable for the dApps and we would love to bring the experience we've built with our first launch on Ethereum to the Cardano community.",

    "description": "The main goals of this project is to improve the quality of the scientific discourse and to improve the publishing process. As pointed out by several authors in the references the scientific publication process and the scientific discourse as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. As a response to this criticism the main argument is that although the current scientific process arrives to accurate conclusions only sometimes, it is still better than nothing. I think we can do better. If we consider all publications in today's scientific journals it can be proven that the error rate of the conclusions presented in these articles is grater than 50%. This results in a high-entropy body of knowledge that keeps progress slow and makes scientific work highly wasteful. Furthermore, apart from the high error rate the current scientific publishing system is highly centralized and restrictive, keeping most of the public out of the scientific discourse. This can only hinder progress and waste human potential. Today's publishing platforms have become bolted obsolete intermediates in the scientific discourse and better alternatives can unlock enormous value. Since scientific papers are only a particular form of intellectual property, a blockchain solution could be developed and implementer for all types of intellectual property in general. This will allow for merit-based rewords for all authors without any intermediary such as a publisher. The solution proposed here for the general problem of Intellectual Property rights protection consists in the development of a side chain that functions as an encrypted descentralysed library stored on each node in the network. The authors can sell or give access keys to their work directly to the public. A key, once purchased also gives the buyer the right to rate and comment the specific work. Fees could be collected from each transaction to cover the costs for running the network.\n\n**Road-map and milestones:**\n\n**1.** Finding a team of 2 developers in the fist month of the project\n\n**2\\.** Side chain block one release in the fourth month.\n\n**3.** Releasing a user -friendly app for publishing, accessing the content and reviewing within 6 months of approval.\n\n**4\\.** On-boarding at least 10 authors in the first 12 months after the project starts.\n\nThe 280000 ADA requested will only cover the development for the first 2 milestones. Another founding round will likely be required for further development depending on the progress.",

    "description": "**Expanded Problem Statement and Solution:**\n\nNothing inspires developers more than successful projects and the development tools needed to build them, especially on new platforms. It's the first wave of successful applications and useful tools that will encourage most developers to build on Cardano.\n\nThis proposal delivers both, an open source Cardano blockchain API for CFML developers so they can plug and play Cardano blockchain functionality into their websites as well as a fully functional dApp with massive potential and global reach that will inspire developers and new users alike by not only showing what is possible on Cardano but provide real utility to developers and pet owners around the world.\n\nLets show developers how services can be re-imagined on Cardano and lets put Cardano to use by offering real utility to both developers and users around the world.\n\n  \n\n**₳Pay API** **\\- An open source toolkit for developers to integrate ADA payments on websites**\n\n₳Pay API is a Cardano blockchain open source toolkit built for developers that facilitates payments and communication between the Cardano blockchain and any website built in Cold Fusion Markup Language (CFML).\n\nWith this open source tool kit developers will be able to rapidly deploy the following functions directly into the backend of their websites:\n\n*   Create a wallet\n*   Check wallet balance\n*   Build transactions\n*   Add metadata to transactions\n*   Send transactions\n*   Confirm transaction has been sent\n*   Retrieve transactions and associated metadata\n\nThis open source toolkit will be published on github and support all websites built on Cold Fusion, Lucee and Railo application servers, for more about Cold Fusion please check out reference \\[1\\] at the bottom of this page.\n\nThe Cardano Pet Registry dApp, detailed in the next section below, will use this toolkit for all communication between the website and the Cardano blockchain.\n\n  \n\n**Pet Registry dApp - A virtually free, non profit, global pet registry system built on the Cardano blockchain**\n\n++Why build a Pet Registry solution on Cardano?++\n\n*   Better, cheaper, significantly more accessible and successful than existing solutions\n*   Massive target audience with a global reach - according to a global study across 22 countries 56% of households have at least one dog or cat \\[2\\]\n*   Can service anyone around the world instantly, a global multilingual solution\n*   Instinctive and simple to use technology\n*   Offers high utility to a massive segment of the global population, high probability of being spread by word of mouth\n*   Exposes completely new people to blockchain tech and Cardano, shows seasoned users how blockchain can be used for something other than sending money, illustrates how Cardano can impact our lives\n*   Inspires devs by demonstrating how everyday systems can be re-imagined and benefit from blockchain tech, we don't have to come up with some crazy innovation when we are surrounded by legacy systems that we can substantially improve\n\n  \n\n++The issue with legacy Pet Registry systems++\n\nMicrochipped pets have a poor rescue rate, only 38.5% of cats and 52.5% of dogs that are microchipped are successfully reunited with their owners after being lost. Most of the time it is due to incorrect owner information (or no owner information) in microchip registry databases, the number one cause was incorrect or disconnected telephone number. \\[3\\]\n\nMicrochipping is a great technology but with a > 50% failure rate in reuniting pets with their owners there are serious problems.\n\nTo make matters even worse over 40% of pets aren't even microchipped where such services are available, often due to the associated costs. \\[3\\]\n\nThe Cardano Pet Registry solves the root causes responsible for high failure rates in legacy systems by enabling pet owners to easily and cheaply update registry information **even after the pet is lost** and without requiring specialized tools and personnel.\n\nThis technology is a game changer with respect to servicing areas where microchipping and registry services are unavailable or simply just not used due to high costs. Also as a complementary technology to combat the high failure rates where records are inadequately maintained due to non-compliance because of the specialized equipment, personnel and high fees of legacy systems.\n\n  \n\n++Is there any demand for the Cardano Pet Registry?++\n\nTo gauge demand for a better Pet Registry solution on Cardano I conducted a survey on reddit. \\[4\\]\\[5\\]\n\nThe survey was a great success with over 49 submission from pet owners within the Cardano reddit commnuity.\n\nKey Findings:\n\n20% of pet owners opted to not register their pets on legacy systems but 100% will register their pets on the Cardano Pet Registry due to accessibility, cost, no invasive procedures.\n\nFrom the 80% that did registered their pet on a legacy system **more than 90% of owners failed to update their contact information after they moved / changed phone number**. If these owners lose their pets it is extremely unlikely that legacy systems will be able to reunite owners with their pets. Where as with the Cardano Pet Registry these users can update outdated information even after their pet is lost, it completely solves this critical flaw and many others.\n\nSurvey Results:\n\n*   80% Have their pet registered/chipped on legacy systems\n*   4% Have their pet chipped but didn't provide phone number/address to registry\n*   69% Have moved or changed their phone number since registering/chipping their pet\n*   63% Haven't updated registry data since moving address/changing number, ie registry data out of date.\n*   100% Would register their pet on the Cardano Pet Registry\n*   98% Would tell their friends that own pets about The Cardano Pet Registry\n*   69% Would consider registering a friends pet on the Cardano Pet Registry\n\n  \n\n++How the Cardano Pet Registry works++\n\nPet owners can register their pets via the Cardano Pet Registry website for the cost of an ADA transaction fee plus a geo-location fee of 20c. Upon registration users will be prompted for any type of contact information they would like to store on the blockchain via a simple web form. After relevant contact information has been saved a unique QR code will be generated representing the pets registration on the blockchain. Pet owners can then print off a free QR code and attach it to their pets collar/tag or alternatively buy a purpose built engraved collar/tag from the website.\n\nLost pets can then be easily reunited with their owners with a simple scan of the QR code, scanning the code will not only notify the owner of when and where their pet was scanned via geo-location technology but also direct the rescuer to the Cardano Registry website which will extract and render the latest contact information the owner left on the blockchain.\n\nOne of the key benefits of using a QR code is that information can be easily and cheaply updated on the blockchain unlimited times without the need to re-create the QR code, even after the pet was lost. On top of that registry information is instantly accessible to anyone with a mobile phone.\n\nKey Benefits:\n\n*   Extremely cheap, the cost of a transaction fee plus 20 cents which funds 40 geo-location requests and your pet is registered on the Cardano blockchain for life\n*   Instinctive and simple technology to use that is accessible to anyone with a mobile phone\n*   Instantly notifies pet owner when and where the pets QR code was scanned via geo-location technology\n*   Rich content and future proof - any type of contact information can be added, even new tech gaining widespread adoption like whatsapp, social media etc\n*   Contact information can be updated unlimited times without requiring a new QR code to be generated\n*   Never out of date, contact information can be edited at any time, even after pet has gone missing, QR scan will always show the latest information stored on the blockchain\n*   Provides registry services where they don't exist or where they are difficult to access or cost prohibitive\n*   Completely self administered system that requires no specialized equipment, personnel or government funding\n*   A peer to peer solution from rescuer to owner without the need to interface with 3rd party systems\n*   Encourages quicker, easier and a more probable pet rescue as owners contact information is instantly accessible to anyone with a mobile phone, no specialized tools or personnel required.\n*   Global uniform service, unlike microchipping where varied standards of microchip, reader technology and regional databases hinder it's success - pets lost out of state, on holiday, etc.\n*   Registry data is encrypted and only accessible to those scanning the QR code or updating the information via the website\n\n  \n\n++Deliverables:++\n\n*   ₳Pay API - open source API that facilitates communication between CFML websites and the Cardano blockchain\n*   A responsive multilingual \"Cardano Pet Registry\" website for both mobile and desktop users\n*   QR code generation, printable versions\n*   Integration with google services for accurate geo-location on QR scan\n*   Implementation of the sustainability strategy - The Cardano Pet Stake Pool\n*   Website and Cardano node Hosting as well as Domain registration until the end of 2021\n*   Ongoing operation and maintenance of all systems including full compatibility with blockchain updates until the end of 2021\n\n  \n\n++Budget:++\n\nHourly rate: $30/hr (modest rate for senior developer of 16+ years commercial experience)\n\nWeek = 38 hours, Full Time\n\nStartup / Development costs: $11,330\n\n*   $3,420 - 3 weeks, development of the open source ₳Pay API\n*   $5,700 - 5 weeks, design and coding of the Cardano Pet Registry responsive multilingual website\n*   $500 - website translation in as many languages as possible to cater for a global audience\n*   $570 - 0.5 week, deploy server infrastructure and website\n*   $1,140 - 1 week, build out sustainability strategy, stake pool website and infrastructure\n\nAnnual maintenance costs: $2,400\n\n*   $30 - .io domain registration for 1 year\n*   $180 - $15/month for 1 year - Stake Pool Relay hosting\n*   $180 - $15/month for 1 year - Stake Pool Block Producer hosting\n*   $300 - $25/month for 1 year - Website Hosting\n*   $570 - 0.5 week, maintenance of code including full compatibility with versions of Cardano\n*   $1,140 - 1 week, maintenance of server infrastructure (website, cardano nodes, etc)\n\nTotal Funding: $13,730 or 133,301₳ @ 10.3c\n\n  \n\n++Proposed Launch:++\n\nWithin 3 months\n\n  \n\n++Project Sustainability:++\n\nIn order for this project to be a success it is absolutely essential that annual maintenance costs are secured every year, there are a number of possibilities to achieve this but the cornerstone to the sustainability strategy will be a purpose built 1% Stake Pool with all fees used to fund the project into the future.\n\nWith a delegation of ~2m in ADA a purpose built stake pool will generate enough funding in fees alone to meet the annual maintenance costs of the Cardano Pet Registry.\n\nIn additional to epoch fees, a 1% pool margin will also be set to fund future enhancements and evolve the project. Due to wide community support for this project and the favourable pool metrics I have high confidence that this pool will acquire a minimum delegation of ~2m to support the project into the future.\n\nOther potential sources of funding include:\n\n*   Sale of optional Cardano QR Code collars\n*   Sale of optional QR engraved dog tags, pendants, etc\n*   Sale of other related optional products\n*   Advertising\n*   Re-evaluation of registration fees as a last resort - will always be strictly non-profit\n\n  \n\n++References:++\n\n\\[1\\] - About Cold Fusion - launched in 1995, is a uniquely placed application server technology that enables extremely rapid development combined with a shallow learning curve. It is very popular among extremely high traffic websites however due to high licensing costs it initially had limited penetration in small business. Fortunately thanks to Lucee, an open source CFML server, this is no longer the case as CFML can now be deployed without any licensing fees, it is seeing greater penetration into small business and as a result is now more popular than ever - quite amazing for a web technology launched a quarter of a century ago.\n\n\\[2\\] - https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2405078/cms-pdfs/fileadmin/user_upload/country_one_pager/nl/documents/global-gfk-survey_pet-ownership_2016.pdf\n\n\\[3\\] - https://todaysveterinarypractice.com/poll-have-the-majority-of-your-clients-gotten-their-pets-chipped/\n\n\\[4\\] - https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/j7jvmy/pet_owners_that_hold_cardano_i_need_20_seconds_on/\n\n\\[5\\] - https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/idea/323939/33179/download",

    "description": "**RINA Users Group**\n\nMission\n\nWe are a RINA Users Group (RUG) in Japan. We are currently working with sponsorship from a communications service provider in Japan. We have weekly meetings to discuss the deployment challenges of RINA. The problems we solve are in preparation for a commercial RINA launch.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\n1\\. Solve the dynamic namespace management, enrollment, flow allocation, resource allocation, routing, and security issues with a recursive taxonomic namespace service. All RINA stacks publicly available use static namespace management.\n\n2\\. Realize a commercial RINA deployment in Japan between two datacenters using ethernet / WDM before February 2021.\n\n3\\. Deploy a Cardano ADA staking host and relay nodes on the RINA network using IP over RINA by March of 2021.\n\n4\\. Work with the Cardano community to test and eventually upgrade the IP over RINA to Ouroboros over RINA using ethernet / WDM sans IP.\n\n5\\. Continuously promote and develop commercially viable RINA solutions and deployments.\n\nOur Sponsor - GLBBJapan\n\nInnovative communications service provider in Japan. www.glbb.jp\n\nIn order for Cardano to attract developers, entrepreneurs, businesses and DAPPS on their global decentralised blockchain over the next six months and beyond, RINA is needed to provide scalability to millions of users on the network.  \n\n  \n\n**RINA Questions and Answers from Cardano Community Members**\n\nQuestions from the community in the LIVE Gauntlet Youtube Chat ( no we did not forget you!)\n\nYOU asked we delivered - Questions ALL answered by Gary Blankenship the project CTO and jason.clark.durham and the RUG ) keep em\\` coming this is a RINA AMA !\n\nUSER: Create The Imaginable\n\nQ/ Is there an open source RINA router implementation? Can RINA work with existing routers?\n\nAnswer: RINA is a router at every IPC so the question is a bit hard to orientate but will assume you mean are any open source stacks available for existing equipment and \"Yes\" with some challenges. Implementation on existing routers using RFC7426 seems the best option at this point even using Network Function Virtualization is an option with this SDN example.\n\nKyle Solomon\n\nQ/ will the end result yield open source / open infrastructure contributions?\n\nAnswer: Yes. For example we have questioned the wisdom of how some things are done and we do plan to experiment. Once we have verified our experiments we will release for peer review and open source is the way we plan. We are planning to contribute 802.2 ethernet shim for example and it is an open milestone for the IRATI project if they will allow it.\n\nLarry Last name\n\nQ/ How will it work with dynamic WAN protocols, like BGP?\n\nAnswer: A RINA shim into the ethernet is just a gateway as a host to the IPv4/v6 cloud. Then the RINA host is seen in the BGP world as just a TCP/IP flow. RINA itself does not need these protocols, single destination, single source view of the tree with Dykstra Shortest Path First simplicity is enough but I would like to see flexible routing policies per IPC. Personal experience says when BGP next hops are routed over OSPF that is running over ISIS say over 802.1ah/802.1aq shortest path bridging is that you only need to play with one of those knobs to achieve your traffic engineering goals.\n\nSergio Marelli\n\nQ/ this RINA technicals are difficult to follow for me ( can we get this explained in a Plain speak non technical version whiteboard)\n\nAnswer: TCP/IP is insecure and cannot scale. RINA can scale and is secure by nature. We need scaling due to the need to run private and public connections over one network that nowadays includes an internet of things. Core routers at service providers today have almost 850,000 best IPv4 routes and the IPv6 table is almost 100,000 routes already! These best routes are boiled down from peer routes all stored in the routing information base. After all this work, nobody can map a name to an address because another trusted 3rd party, DNS, is needed. This is centralized routing and naming. RINA will prioritize naming and deprecate the concept of global addressing. Addresses are not even needed on point-to-point links. Routing is done to a taxonomy and not to an address. Your address is private between the directly connected parties. RINA also brings the noise level of the internet way down as port scans and such will cease to a halt.\n\nKyle Solomon\n\nQ/ yeah there needs to be global distance test (not just Tokyo to Tokyo but Tokyo to LA or example)\n\nAnswer: We will use the Viavi TB-5800-100G to discern our performance locally sans RINA with L1 BERT testing. After that we will test with RINA and some special tests we are planning. Once we know we have a working solution we do plan to connect a RINA node to a RINA node over our redundant 10G connections between LA and Tokyo.\n\nGeoffrey Shearing\n\nRINA is a better faster network protocol. WHY?\n\nAnswer: As related to Cardano it will allow it to do transactions faster as the resources will not have central bottlenecks. Existing protocols also assume too many errors and the largest Ethernet MTU's are not more than 10K bytes, usually 9,000 to 9,600 bytes are maximum transmission unit for PDU's over ethernet jumbo frames, RINA can get a lot more data through a flow in larger frames. Having an adjustable frame size only make sense nowadays as a normal enterprise 10G ethernet circuit is usually tested clean at line rate for 24 hours before putting into service. This means that the message can be in very large packets rather than broken into many small frames. I do not know the MTU that native RINA will settle but I suspect it to be much higher default than existing ethernet.\n\nPlanetStake\n\nQ/ OK, so RINA is decentralised internet data flow which can gain the benefits from TCP/IP or 5G, so it has nothing to do with speed?\n\n\\*latency, not speed\n\nAnswer: Lower latency is a huge consideration when you consider the large frames that can be transferred by DTP which does not yet have a consensus limit for maximum transmission unit.\n\nCreate The Imaginable\n\nQ/ Is there an open source software RINA router implementation that is planned? Can RINA work with existing routers?\n\nAnswer: I answered this question above\n\nPlanetStake\n\nQ/ How does RINA latency compare to 5G ?\n\nAnswer: Good question. Our experimentation is focused on the wired-line and not 5G. Generally speaking from the ISP business we are not seeing any decrease in demand for smoking fast fiber connectivity. Latency is going to be dependent on the bits required to encode the data. We know there are folks working with a Canadian provider to implement a RINA architecture but it is really not our project.\n\nCreate The Imaginable\n\nQ/ RINA should be plug and play! Cant it be?\n\nAnswer: Yes, one of our many RINA projects focuses on how to RAMP up a network! We hope to talk abut this more in the future\n\nyabishhh a\n\nQ/ Can a staking pool in Rina have better ROI than a regular pool?\n\nAnswer: We think the main difference will be the connectivity of the ISP that you use. We are confident in the connectivity of AS55900 at two datacenters in Tokyo. Our interest is in RINA's success so we will do everything in our power to help it be above average but a lot of the fairness will remain in the hands of the Ouroboros protocol. One thing about \"better\" is that RINA networks need time and if Ouroboros Chronos can do that for RINA than the staking pool makes RINA better.\n\nPlanetStake\n\nQ/ Lower latency inernet then?\n\nYes, DTP encapsulation is superior to ethernet and IP encapsulation with a larger payload, not interrupting with the inter-frame gap every 64 to 1500 bytes (or 9600 bytes for jumbo frames)\n\nra Bliss\n\nQ/ Jason you say RINA is far greater? HOW?\n\nAnswer: RINA is a scientific approach to cause and effect architecture design resulting in optimised distinct protocols and mechanisms required to deliver the equivalent core functionality of TCP/IP.\n\nMarcin Rotter\n\nQ/ Why do we have time limits on free webcast?\n\nAnswer: The various platforms ( like face book or YouTube) put various restrictions on their users to manage resources - A dedicated RINA DIF could one day make a decentralize platform do things the users want and not the platform wall street shareholders.\n\nFrom Mark Stopka\n\nQ/ You are proposing a test between to data centers connected through WDM What would be the distance between the 2 data centers ? Or expected latency in milli secs between the 2\n\nAnswer: We will use 25G DWDM SFP28 modules and measure latency with a Viavi TB-5800-100G for baseline L1 and L2 BERT tests. We will use organic GLBBJapan code for ethernet over RINA to take an L2 BERT baseline. There are native RINA performance tools we can compare such as rlite project baselines (https://github.com/rlite/rlite). We want to use Tokyo because it is the core of the transit links for AS55900. Expansion to Okinawa and Osaka in Japan and surely Los Angeles are on the radar of successes. We also plan to ride over IP to connect to our RINA network from remote solo nodes so we expect to gain lots of knowledge regarding latency over \"time.\" Success breeds success!\n\nQ/ Since you are implementing IP over RINA what kind results are you expecting to find from this experiment ? In terms of performance improvements or scalability ? What would be the deliverable of this initial research other than it worked ?\n\nAnswer: There are two elements here. One is RINA, the other is Cardano. GLBBJapan is implementing RINA. Cardano shim into RINA will actually start with TCP over RINA as that is the way their code would plug in today. We hope to encourage them to Ouroboros over RINA. We will report all of the Cardano test results in addition to the baseline RINA network measurements so the delta is understood at ever step. We do expect that the 25Gbps servers connected to the core 802.1ah/802.1aq SPBM fabric will see performance achievements over the standard cloud provider. Below is a performance measurement from one perspective of AS55900 verses Amazon AS16509. We think being in the core of AS55900 has advantages over being in the insecure userland of Amazon. It is a tenant of our RINA Users Group to focus on our partnerships to focus exactly on performance improvements and scalability and thank you for your focus on same.\n\nhttps://radar.qrator.net/as55900\n\nhttps://radar.qrator.net/as16509\n\nQ/ What are the current limitation of the current internet with regards to using RINA technology over a long distance over the internet and would you need to replace core routers of all the major telcos like Verizon British telecom?\n\nAnswer: Our proposal is for RINA to ride over IP so nothing needs replacement. We feel the accountants will win in the end. One example is with MPLS. Recently, technologies like VXLAN are shredding MPLS in the market. Is RINA not the same? Like ZeroTier, could one use RINA and say 802.2 SNAP frames with RINA to expand the IPv4 address space by 24 bits of OUI (in the SNAP frame header?) Our proposal is to have fun and experiment and learn the answers to your questions as we surf the real commercial market opportunities. The RUG is not in charge of the project. This is a real R&D project already funded. The RUG is there to focus on use cases for the network.\n\nQ/ Would rina over IP be a good concept ? Or is IP over RINA better ? Why\n\nDoes distance matter to the results ?\n\nAnswer: I think our RUG in Japan would want a RUG at that distant location or for that location to be under a network under 100% control so we can have exact telemetry. Distance is one thing to consider of course and in the connectivity business all you need is enough trust to establish a flow. We are very open to things especially considering the phased approach to the Catalyst funding by Cardano where perhaps we can fund other RUGs that have local RINA enclaves. I think this week our RUG meeting will discuss making a video to introduce ourselves to the community.\n\nPHILIPPE (TCE HOST)\n\nQ/ IF the RINA test proved to be positive how long would it take for us to implement something like that for all cardano nodes and is it even feasible would it involve all cardano nodes kinda of reinventing their node structure to run RINA ?\n\nAnswer: It would be seemless as it would be a migration from IP. We would hope when a Cardano node sees an IP interface it acts like IP and when it sees a RINA interface perhaps a RINA shim over ethernet / ip that it acts like RINA. Ethernet framing is really unnecessary for RINA so we are hoping we can develop Ouroboros directly over RINA for the future.",

    "description": "TheDealersDen.com is a standalone, profitable internet business in the Cosplay Arts community. We operate mainly as a sales platform and auction house for small businesses that desire to connect with individuals interested in purchasing unique, custom and re-sale costumes and artwork. We have been online for over a decade, but recently acquired by new ownership in January 2018. At the moment, we have 27,871 registered users with 602 new accounts in the last 30 days. Although relatively small compared to our competitors (eBay/Etsy/Amazon), we are able to offer much more to our users in terms of value per advertising dollar paid and we plan to grow much faster technologically than any of these established behemoths.\n\nOur expertise is primarily in marketing and community management, although blockchain became a heavy focus for us starting in September 2017. We began like many others with Bitcoin, and after a couple years of heavy research, pivoted almost exclusively to Cardano, which we believe to be Bitcoin 3.0 - with the addition of smart contracts, governance, and a highly intelligent, driven community, minus the maximalism. Our vision is symbiotic with most of those in the Cardano community - To create something that lasts longer than we do, to bring value to the communities we cherish, and to open up commerce and free trade to anyone with an internet connection across the globe.\n\nCurrently, our platform is in need of a major overhaul and we would like to rebuild our business with Cardano at the heart of its financial center. TheDealersDen.com will be a community interaction platform for businesses and fans of cosplay, anime, art, and more. We want to build a peer-to-peer system for businesses and individuals to buy/sell merchandise to one another in a verifiable way and track ownership of one-of-a-kind costumes, artwork, and merchandise on a public blockchain. A social platform and phone app that rewards positive interaction with others and promotes sales. Built into the platform will be Positive/Negative incentivization mechanisms such as profile rewards for purchases, achievements for repeated good behavior/order completion, customer/business reviews, and strict penalties for non-payment that attach to each user account to create an honest and vibrant marketplace for our community to interact at low-cost and with high security over their funds and identity, while allowing our administrative team to monitor interactions and settle disputes between parties.\n\nSecurity is always the top concern when it comes to online financial transactions, but with Cardano and Plutus, we are confident that we can build a provably secure and fun platform for our users to transact on. We believe that everything to do with identity and account data, transaction history, and funds on the platform should only be accessible to the users themselves with the corresponding private key and to authorized admin accounts with their own private key. We would like for our users to own their own data and funds while interacting with our platform, so it is important to allow the user the ability to withdraw their funds at any time and delete the data access from our platform to their user data if they delete their account.\n\nWe would like to utilize Atala Prism for users identity, Atala Scan for verified items, and Adrestia for cross-platform transfers, using our own custom Token.\n\nOur focus is set on steady, sustainable growth of our community and building an organic, healthy, free and open marketplace for a multitude of different communities and interest groups. With assistance from Fund2, we are sure to meet these goals.\n\n  \n\nWith this proposal, we have requested 250,000 ADA to build out our new platform. While this is currently only an estimate of the total funds needed, **we guarantee that 100% of every ADA awarded to us by Project Catalyst will be used to further improve our website and user interface by hiring professional developers within the Cardano ecosystem.**\n\n  \n\nPlease feel free to visit our website at: www.TheDealersDen.com\n\nYou can also view our main Telegram Sales Channel with over 6,000 members here: https://t.me/thedealersden\n\n  \n\nWhile we strive to evolve and grow over time, our initial roadmap includes the following:\n\n  \n\n**1\\. USD -> The Dealers Den Token On-ramp**\n\nHave an on-ramp that allows people to use USD/their preferred fiat currency and purchase The Dealers Den Tokens easily. This would require some sort of 3rd-party service integration which would purchase ADA, and The Dealers Den platform could convert the ADA it receives into The Dealers Den Tokens which are placed in a users 'account wallet'.\n\nThe 'account wallet' is a wallet that is saved in The Dealers Den database, yet is also exposed to the user (mnemonic provided). This way, the user can simply have a username/password to login and use their wallet, or they can import it into their own software as well. Alternatively, they can also withdraw their Dealers Den Tokens from their 'account wallet' to an address they specify.\n\nThese Dealers Den Tokens are convertible tokens which represent 1 USD and can be used on the platform to purchase goods/bid on auctions or used as a dollar equivalent medium of exchange, transferable independently between individuals.\n\n  \n\n**2\\. Shops offering Direct Listings and Auctions (w/ 10% collateral bidding and buyout options)**\n\nOn The Dealers Den platform, sellers have a 'store front' (Think eBay) where they can offer direct listings (Buy it Now) or Auctions.\n\nAuctions require submitting 10% of collateral with a bid to add a disincentive for non-payment. Once an auction is finished, the winner must pay the final 90% or get their 10% collateral taken after 'X' amount of time has passed.\n\nOnce an item has been paid for (whether direct listing or auction), the funds are held in an interim-stage until the buyer has received their goods and confirmed it on the platform. Once confirmed, the funds go to the seller.\n\nIf the buyer never confirms, then the seller can initiate a dispute.\n\nIf the buyer never receives the item or it isn't as claimed, then he/she can initiate a dispute.\n\n  \n\n**3\\. Administrative Backend for handling disputes, appeals, and abuse reports.**\n\nThe Dealers Den website has an administrative backend which allows for viewing such disputes and making decisions.\n\nAdministrators also have an account wallet and their keys give them the right to have a final say on disputes about who gets the money. They make a decision, which gets saved in The Dealers Den database, and then posted on-chain as a tx to finalize the decision and move the funds to the winning party.\n\n  \n\n**4\\. Verified Users and Item Authentication**\n\nOnce the base layer of the platform has been built, our next goal will be to integrate with an identity solution such as Atala Prism. This will allow for greater transparency among users and businesses while building trust and reputation in the community. Additionally, we would like to add item authentication to securely transfer ownership of registered items between users on the platform. As a secondary benefit, these registered items will be publicly catalogued and with only a glance, users can verify that one-of-a-kind items are authentic and owned by the user listing it. These authentication tokens will be automatically transferred with the sale of the item if listed on The Dealers Den and manually transferable otherwise.\n\n  \n\n**Visual Roadmap descriptions (See ++TDD-Roadmap-20221d.png++):**\n\n**++*Active Market: Current Product*++**\n\nThis is the current website as it stands today. We aim to completely rebuild the platform from a PHP-based web application to a blockchain-based peer-to-peer Auction and Sales platform.\n\n**++*Core Build: New base product with be built (#1-3)*++**\n\nThe Minimum Viable Product **(MVP)** is encompassed by the described milestones above. (#1-3) Funding will be disbursed only to developers building this stage of the new product until it is completed.\n\n**++*Phase ALPHA: Internal Testing Phase (Staff Only)*++**\n\nOnce the MVP has been completed and tested thoroughly by the developers, we will begin onboarding our administration team and staff for training and to test the new product for bugs. During this stage, we will be accepting internal critiques and proposals to improve the quality of the product before moving to Phase BETA. As we near the end of Phase ALPHA, we will open sign-ups to anyone interested in testing the product during Phase BETA.\n\n**++*Phase BETA: Public Testing Phase (Live Auctions and Listings)*++**\n\nOnce Phase ALPHA is completed and tested thoroughly by our staff, we will begin the public testing phase. Those who signed up near the end of Phase ALPHA will receive an e-mail containing a link that allows them to create a new account on the new platform. This will allow them to test the product with real auctions and listings and give feedback before Protocol Launch.\n\n**++*Protocol Launch: Public Release (Base Product Launch)*++**\n\nUpon Public Release, anyone will be allowed to sign up and use the platform. Testing will have gone through numerous stages, ensuring security and usability. We will have also gone through several feedback stages with our community and staff, ensuring that we have delivered the best available product to market for growing businesses and individuals within our community.\n\n**++*Identity Verification Module: Post-Launch Module Addition*++**\n\nWith the core product built, we can now focus on building additions to the platform to create a feature-rich environment that people love. If there is funding remaining after the Core Build, it will be disbursed to developers building here next. Each module will expand the capabilities of the platform in their respective ways. The Identity Verification Module is an addition that will attach a platform account to a real-world identity utilizing an identity solution such as Atala Prism. The goal of this module is to build trust and reputation between businesses and individuals in delivering the products, services, and funds agreed to via our platform.\n\n**++*Product Tracking Catalogue: Post-Launch Module Addition*++**\n\nIf there is funding remaining after building the Identity Verification Module, it will be disbursed to developers building here next. The goal of the Product Tracking Catalogue is to link registered items and products to verified identities and create a web of ownership details on items that attach to a non-fungible token on the blockchain representing the item in the real world. This token is attached to items during the listing process and transferred automatically upon closure of the sale. Alternatively, these tokens may be transferred manually between individuals and the details updated accordingly by the new token holder. This module generates an immutable, time-stamped history for all registered items and transfers of that item.\n\n**++*End of Life: Final Days of Current Product (Retire)*++**\n\nAt this stage, our MVP is complete, along with two cutting-edge module additions, rendering our old platform obsolete. We will announce the closure of the old platform and migrate the remainder of our users to the new one.\n\n**++*Full Integration: New Product Finalization*++**\n\nThe Cardano Platform built for TheDealersDen.io is merged with TheDealersDen.com and the old platform is now completely shut down. Users will only be able to sign up and utilize the Cardano-based platform for website transactions.\n\n**++*Additional Modules?: Potential Future Upgrades & Improvements*++**\n\nIf any funding is remaining by this stage, we will begin allocating it to further development of new platform modules that enhance the user experience and feature-rich environment of the platform or benefit our community in some way. Ideas from community members are always considered for implementation based on viability, desirability, and cost-effectiveness.",

    "solutionDescription": "We would like to pay the chief-editor and the authors of the content.",
    "outcomeObjectives": null,
    "description": "**The current state:**\n\nWe recently founded cardanojournal.com, the website that has gained more than 1,000 fans on Twitter in the first 2 months of its existence. The goal is to create a place with daily updated content regarding the Cardano project.\n\nThe current content is created by our team (mostly the Cardanians content) and aggregation of selected individuals that publish the content. However, we see a lot of space for improvements and we have ambitions to take the project to the next level by providing more content, interviews, and other relevant articles.\n\n**How we want to achieve it:**\n\n\\- Attract ​​authors and contributors who will regularly provide up-to-date content regarding cryptocurrencies and DeFi with the focus on Cardano. We would like to publish educational content as well as popular articles and interviews with people from IOG, Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, SPOs, and other visible individuals in the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n\\- We would like to motivate and reward regular and occasional authors for writing and publishing high-quality articles or other contributions. We would like to pay them by ADA.\n\n\\- We would like to find other interested editors that could become part of the team. A regular fixed reward should be considered.\n\n**Funding (monthly):**\n\n· 5,000 ADA per month for the position of the chief editor. It could be Jaromir Tesar, the author of extensive articles that are available at https://cardanians.io/en/blog. The reward would cover management, moderation, approvals of other articles.\n\n· 20,000 ADA budget for rewarding other regular or irregular contributors. The reward would depend on the length of the article and the quality that could be weighted from 1 to 3. The following system could be applied:\n\n1) The number of approved articles per month. The number of characters would be taken into account as well as the quality. The reward would be distributed monthly.\n\n2) The monthly target of 100-200 contributions with an average length of 3000 characters.\n\n3) That would result in an average reward of 150 ADA for a contribution.\n\n4) The quality level will be guaranteed by the position of the chief-editor. If 500 articles per month would be published then the reward would be lower. We expect that 500 is not achievable and even if it was, the quality of articles would not be good in all cases. We expect the contrary. Fewer articles per month. In this case, the reward would be higher. The goal is to publish only high-quality articles that would be fairly rewarded.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n· Preparation of the CMS system and preparation of rules for the approval of the article within 2 months.\n\n· The first visible result in the next month from the preparation (so after 2 months).\n\n**Funding rounds (after 3 months):**\n\n· 1. round: 100,000 ADA for 4 months of the experimental operation.\n\n· 2. round: The gradual evaluation and possibly adjusting of rules. For example, we can find out that 10,000 ADA is a sufficient budget for rewarding authors.\n\n· 3. round: Evaluation of the state and thinking about the next steps. The process of approvals could be partially automated based on the previous history of contributors and/or voting of the reader. On the other hand, we believe that the journal will never be a fully automated process and people should be involved. It would be nice to have a small group of editors.",

While the voting capabilities of Voltaire are exciting, the project still needs humans to take action once decisions are made. This won't always be as simple as agreeing to implement a code change, so the actions required to carry out the social changes to our ecosystems need structured groups to do so.\n\nA document that elaborates on how the CCC and its sub-committees will be structured and operated will be provided if this proposal gains support.

The podcasts will be composed of debates and interviews with prominent figures which will help us discuss the commercial benefits and uses of blockchain technology in order to attract entrepreneurs, developers and businesses into our society.\n\nConsidering the complexity that Cardano represents for an average user, we will also attempt to increase awareness through easy to follow examples and explanations to encompass a broad range of followers.

He's joining the team as an advisor, and will probably help organize community events.\n*   **Gift Lipato**, an electrician. He's eager to learn how to code.\n*   **Vanessa Lipato**, a business woman with an educational background in community development. She wants to learn more about software development and will probably take a leading role in community interaction.\n*   **Madalitso Kalinde**, a financial assistance officer. He's very interested in learning to write applications involving finances.\n\n  \n\n**Some more about me:**\n\nI love Programming, Physics, Linguistics, Category Theory, System Dynamics, Cultural Anthropology, Cellular Biology, Astronomy, and Graphic Design. I started programming when I was 12 (25 years ago) in QBasic with the help of my mom who did some Basic programming for work in the early 80's. For the last 15 years I've spent 2-4 hours a day studying, and mostly focus on programming language design and how language features affect your productivity, developer experience, and the way you think about structuring your code. The things that brought me to Cardano were the use of Haskell, formal verification, and the fact that a hero like Phil Wadler was working on the smart contract language.\n\nMy favorite language is probably Elm, in which I'm highly confident in my skills.. I've also spent a lot of time reading Haskell code.. mostly the Elm compiler. I think Elm is a good place to start teaching, because of it's notoriously helpful compiler messages. It's like Haskell, but simpler.. a good gateway drug to Haskell.\n\nI don't have a lot on my Github page (mostly silly little Elm apps), but I've linked it to my proposal.\n\n  \n\n**Learning and Teaching**\n\n**\\-- Some Theory --**\n\nWhen someone teaches somethin*g, there's often a mental model for the subject in the teacher's head. The goal is to replicate the mental model in the minds of the students, building up new knowledge upon prerequisite structures.*\n\nThis is a valuable approach if the subject you're teaching has a rigid structure, like how an algebra builds upon simple rules to provide structure for describing more complex problems, but relying on a limited source of information and possibly taking a standardized testing approach to assessing a student's competency in the subject produces a more static equilibrium in understanding of the system space of problems to solve related to the topic at hand.\n\nRestrictions are often beneficial if they can steer someone clear of avoidable pitfalls. Such is the case in functional programming where things like immutability can give you assurance that data isn't being changed from underneath you and that you can easily test the correctness of your functions, because the lack of side-effects means that the same inputs won't produce different results. This gives you the freedom to work on the function in isolation from the rest of the system which means holding less code in your head at a time. When you're trying to learn how to solve a problem in the real world, restrictions on how you can approach the problem will structure your strategy for implementing a solution, but the learning process benefits from being able to reach out into the unknown and destructure information from a potentially infinite source.. This is the categorical dual to teaching a known structure.\n\nHaving a medium that allows you to prove the viability of your ideas is a good step towards weeding out any knowledge structures that may contain misconceptions, and if you require students to teach each other what they learn, it forces them to take mental note of the dependency hierarchy of information they are trying to share and also how to explicitly articulate things in a way that's easier to understand.\n\nIf students are taking their education into their own hands, there is potential to produce a wider range of knowledge in the group, which allows for more dynamic coverage of the system space of solutions to a problem. It also means less a reliance on an instructor. There's only the need for someone to focus on facilitating the desired environment for learning to take place and maybe steer people in the right direction if they go off course. It's also easier for students to take the teacher's role after they've gained a little experience, which produces the possibility for exponential growth in the reach of education if you have teams that split and produce more teams.\n\n***\\-- Some Application --***\n\nI see mob programming as a good model to allow students to teach each other and figure out solutions to problems as a group. It also requires less computers, which will make it cheaper to scale up. More eyes on a problem would mean less of a chance of mistakes and more insight into the trade-offs between different approaches.\n\nA group engaged in mob programming also wouldn't require much to scale into a startup because the style of learning involved models how teams usually work in the real world anyway.. People discussing how to move forward, while they take turns at the keyboard typing what the others decide they should. New developers get to start out with opportunities to actually write code even before they might entirely understand what it is that they are typing while the others help them learn.\n\nStruggling through problems, with insight from mistakes in approaches taken, can also produce perseverance in finding a good solutions, even if they might take more time and effort to implement. A well researched and proven system design is often worth waiting for -- which is why, I think, people in our community appreciate Cardano.\n\n  \n\n**Project Ideas:**\n\n*   Web-based, interactive learning materials for functional programming, Cardano use, and smart contract development that is optimized for viewing on a smartphone.\n*   Napkin: A step evaluator for Plutus Core to help people decipher the infamous golden symbols on a certain black table tissue.\n*   A game idea I've been working on with a physics system that incorporates Plutus as an in-game scripting language with the ability to interface with Cardano to store game-state hashes as snapshots of the system as well as player inventories, etc…\n*   Porting plc to the Pony language and use the Haskell version for parity checking. Pony is a Object-Oriented / Actor-Model language, but it eliminates runtime errors with its strong algebraic type system and the need for locks on data with its reference capabilities. It's good for distributing low-latency code across all your cores, and since it's garbage collection happens at the actor level, there's no stop-the-world GC, like you'd find in GHC.. which concerns me for something like a game server.\n*   An app where people can buy and sell things, hire transport for goods, and negotiate the price for each step. It could also include a rating system for sellers and transporters so they have to maintain a good reputation. Payments could be finalized when the goods are delivered. There could also be things like insurance for sellers and drivers so that if a valuable product is lost in transit, the seller can still get paid, or if a driver has to return a product to the sender, the driver can still get paid for the extra work.\n*   An exchange between MWK and Ada. Maybe a stable coin for the kwacha.\n*   Experimentation in higher-level language features built on Plutus Core.. What can be possible if you set aside the historical baggage of currently available options?",

    "description": "TORUS IS AN OPEN SOURCE PLATFORM FOR GOVERNING AND FUNDING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE\n\n\"Work on your passion. Pay your bills.\"\n\nOur mission is to provide stability and drive prosperity to open source software projects by delivering a blockchain-based governance and treasury system that OSS projects can use as a foundation.\n\n  \n\n**IMPACT**\n\nWe believe this project will deliver huge impact in the Cardano ecosystem. We envision a future where open source lives and breathes Cardano. ADA will be the means of funding and compensation while Plutus smart contracts will enforce team contracts that drive collaborative productivity.\n\nNot only will this expose the entire open source ecosystem to Cardano, it will be the very means of driving successful collaboration and value transfer, bringing thousands of users into the Cardano ecosystem in a deep and meaningful way -- relying on Cardano to handle their means of income and spending.\n\n  \n\n\\*\\*\\* CHECK OUT OUR **INTERACTIVE PROTOTYPES \\*\\*\\***\n\nContributor Flow: https://www.figma.com/proto/SizU8zBj6QxCk4MWrm5DIP/torus-fund-2-contrib?node-id=0%3A448&scaling=contain\n\nProject Owner Flow: https://www.figma.com/proto/UFyiBEShqz767N9abbkCew/torus-fund-2-project-owner?node-id=0%3A280&scaling=contain\n\n  \n\n\\*\\*\\* PLEASE REVIEW OUR SLIDE DECK FOR AN EASY-TO-FOLLOW EXPLANATION \\*\\*\\*\n\nhttps://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/068Wk5IQVjykCuDLpaZf_ROng#Torus-slides\n\n  \n\nMarket: We're focusing on the open source software market, because its needs are a close fit with the strengths of blockchain contracts. So far, everyone else making DAOs or DO software has tried to solve the problem in such a broad way that it doesn't address any specific needs in the market.\n\nProduct: The product addresses governance, which covers the three top issues in open source software today: Funding, Disagreements, Community toxicity. By supporting the open source ecosystem, we hope to fuel development of free and open software that benefits the members of all digital ecosystems.\n\nAs we grow, our automated donation mechanism will continue to fund the project and provide a source to self-fund and to continue to deliver value to open source projects everywhere. We hope to become a de-facto solution for new and established open source projects. If we can drive success in the open source community, we hope to initiate a virtuous cycle by which Torus can create value as well as benefit from the value created by the open source community.\n\n  \n\nWhat are the next steps?\n\nWith funding from Project Catalyst, we can afford to develop a beta version of this software within 6 months\n\n1\\. Design a software application with\n\n\\- User profiles\n\n\\- Circle membership\n\n\\- Badges\n\n\\- Trust levels\n\n\\- ADA wallet payouts\n\n\\- Git integration\n\n2\\. Design mechanisms for\n\n\\- Trust levels\n\n\\- Badges\n\n3\\. Make interactive wireframe prototypes\n\n4\\. Test with partners\n\n5\\. Develop core wallet-interaction logic\n\n6\\. Develop application\n\n7\\. Test\n\n8\\. Iterate\n\n9\\. Polish Beta version\n\n10\\. Release\n\n  \n\nThe requested 150000 ADA will fund this project through the **first three steps only**.

    "description": "Problem to solve:\n\nAdapools.org is probably the most visited tool that helps delegators from the ITN. The tool provides a comprehensive overview of current staking pools with lots of metrics and a certain degree of prediction to offer the most suitable pool. Users are able to compare and track their favorite pools. The tool allows pool operators to interact with their delegators. ADApools has become an official source of data for the Yoroi Wallet.\n\nHowever, by its nature, such a tool must remain independent, and therefore it is not possible to accept payments from strong operators for giving them some advantages. It is also not smart to pay for the development via the advertisement. All income should be purely from voluntary donations or sponsored by independent supporters.\n\nYou can already see the enthusiasm and many achievements like web, telegram bot, mobile application and others. All that has happened during a few months from the main-net launch.\n\nThat is why we would like to get funding for further development. We would like to be inline with the Cardano roadmap and satisfy operators and delegators needs.\n\nDetailed plan:\n\nThe obtained funds will be used exclusively for the maintenance and further development of the platform for the next 1 year. It can be expected specifically in these particular areas:\n\n· Maintaining independence and financial freedom. Thus, there will never be a paid advertisement (except the bootstrap initiative).\n\n· Providing more APIs for developers (open db sync, graphql, wallet outputs, pool metrics,…).\n\n· Providing more functions for stakepool operators\n\n· The service development that will respect incoming smart contracts, DeFi marketcaps, voting, transaction explorer, etc.\n\n· More analytical tools.\n\n· Providing support to pool operators by telegram, email.\n\n· Education in the field of staking and pools, creation of tools, thematic articles.\n\n· Mobile application development.\n\nFunding:\n\nSo far, the ADApools has been subsidized exclusively from private funds and created on a voluntary basis, which unfortunately cannot be done indefinitely. The project does not generate any income outside the Cardano Foundation grant: 3x $1000. Then, we obtained a few small donations (donations + Patreon), it was approximately $700. Our further income is generated by the POOL pool with 1,89%.\n\nWe would ideally get 250,000 ADA that would ensure the operation and development of the tool according to the financial plan and timeline that is described below. It would help to push the tool to the new quality level.\n\nThe obtained funds will not be exchanged on the exchange. They will be exclusively used for 100% holding in exchange for further investments from the private funds.\n\n· 160,000 ADA: Maintenance and development of the web platform and API outputs.\n\n· 40,000 ADA: Estimated costs for the operation of servers, licenses, domains for a period of 1 year.\n\n· 50,000 ADA: A motivational part and the reward for external mobile application developers.\n\nTimeline:\n\nThe obtained funds will cover 1 year of the development, with these expectations:\n\n· New API extensions for developers can be expected within 2 months.\n\n· Reward / Portfolio monitoring can be expected within 3 months.\n\n· New / additional version of node stats (adapools.org/connect) can be expected within 3 months.\n\n· A newer version 2.0 of the mobile application for Google Play and Apple Store with advanced features within 3 months and more another's features next year\n\n· With the gradual release of new Cardano functions (smart contracts, voting, DeFi services, etc.) users can expect continuous expansion of functions on the web platform, mobile application and API outputs.\n\nWe could also launch other tools needed for DeFi, Cardano CMC like application, etc.\n\nFunding rounds:\n\n1\\. 250,000 ADA: Ensuring operation and further development of the platform, licensing and HW for the next 1 year.\n\n2\\. In another round we would be happy there again with some new tool: smart contract / dapps explorer / DeFi explorer.\n\nUPDATE 2.10.2020:\n\nAbout main, fund2 question: \"How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?\"\n\nPoS and staking itself is one of the most interesting things on Cardano. We are pretty sure that extend and make ADApools outputs available to more developers will increase the development of dApps. We are going to prepare a few really interesting API. Developers can use it without bothering with testing and configuration. There will be db with stake-pools, dApps, and many related tables with comparisons, outputs, etc.\n\nUPDATE 14.10.2020:\n\nBased on excellent feedback, especially from Daniel, we reduced the required amount and the period of the year when we can move the platform enormously and meet all the set goals, and only if the goals are met we will eventually apply in one of the next phases of the catalyst.\n\nThereby increasing a certain motivation for us and at the same time the community itself will see what progress and results we will actually deliver and will be able to make further decisions accordingly in the future.",

Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson won the 2020 Nobel Economics Prize\\[1\\] for their pioneering work into auction theory that drives these automated markets. Google Adwords, energy generation, efficient transportation networks such as airport landing slots, internet routing, or Uber and many other gig-economy labour markets benefit from these automated decision-making tools.\n\nThe opportunities for smart-markets are both large and varied. Far more than the simple bilateral trading found in competitive markets.\n\nThis proposal outlines a T shaped project, going broad on the five key topics that contribute to building smart-markets on Cardano. Emphasising its unique features and amplifying the strategic vision as a financial operating system. We'll be diving deep on a specific application of our auction protocol to illustrate how Cardano's unique features can be used in real-world smart-markets.\n\nA smart-market solution can be applied to problems such as:\n\n*   **logistics** problems for reliable fertiliser distribution in Ethiopia, a complex dynamic market riddled with grift.\n*   replenish **food banks**, efficiently distributing nearly expired foods and reducing food waste.\n*   cooperative housing, or small community-owned solar and wind **power generation** and battery storage.\n*   An impact-oriented **e-learning** platform matching students to course material and tutors.\n*   provision of biodiversity conservation efforts with contracted and volunteer **crowdsourcing**.\n*   **stablecoin** designs.\n*   **foreign currency exchange** with low demand.\n*   person-to-person **sports betting**.\n\nThe intent of this proposal is to research, design, and prototype a decentralised auction protocol and associated Oracle Pool design. It leverages the work already done by Emurgo Research to enrich and strengthen the economic logic of Stake Pool Operators.\n\nTesting real-world smart-markets is expensive. To make the problem approachable and limit the scope for this proposal, we are using a Trading Card Game, Dark Country \\[2\\], as our test use-case. This will demonstrate using Cardano's custom tokens and meta-data support to represent unique items, sometimes called Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT). Custom Tokens and NFTs can be used to represent other tradable assets such as art, shares in layered digital artworks, music rights, or stages in a transportation network.\n\nOur approach will implement the auction protocol on-chain to collect offers and clear them efficiently. Oracles calculate the optimal allocation of all card trades in a transparent manner. The layer-2 prototype will show how game players can strategically stack their decks. Swapping cards anonymously without needing Ada or any other crypto-currency to make the trades.\n\nBy prototyping with a trading card game, learning in public, we can iterate faster, learn more and inspire others. The resulting toolkit of learning resources, UI designs, NFT Meta-Data Standards, protocol engineering and prototype Plutus code can be used as the basis to solve complex market allocation problems all over the world.\n\n**Team**\n\nThe team has experience in financial markets software engineering, tech start-ups, Data & Govtech, impact investing, art, music, and education. We are active in organizing legal-tech community and facilitating online communities in gaming and education. The team includes six members established within the Cardano community during fund 2.\n\n*RO*: Distributed Systems Software Engineer (Financial systems) and Entrepreneur. Co-Founded three start-ups in Financial Data Analytics, International Trade Payments, and Impact Investing. Co-Organises LegalHackers NZ, and advises a Social Entrepreneurship charity.\n\n*NH*: A Teacher, technology enthusiast and stake pool operator. Nick has worked in semiconductor research and in front-line technical support as well as teaching. Extensive experience with online communities, particularly with gaming and education of non-technical users in block-chain products.\n\n*AW*: Distributed systems software engineer, mostly in the financial sector in the City of London. Worked at Barclays Capital (credit risk) and LIFFE (derivatives exchange). Also experienced with the hospitality sector.\n\nFull team details are available in also the attached proposal summary document.\n\nWe will draw upon other skills including Economist, Data Scientist, UX Designer as needed.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\nWe are leveraging the work already done by IOG and Emurgo, and we will contribute back to the developer ecosystem. If an opportunity presents itself, contributing to the emerging developer portal with the knowledge acquired.\n\n*   Research reading bibliography.\n*   Simulation models using cadCAD, published as Jupyter notebooks.\n*   Define NFT meta-data standards (draft).\n*   Plutus code for auction and oracle pool protocols.\n*   Oracle Pool node software (research quality).\n*   Trading Card NFTs (that in principle can have a market value)\n*   UX Prototypes to illustrate market interactions.\n*   Maintain social media channels Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Youtube.\n*   Document concepts and progress in blog posts and video explainers.\n\nDocumentation will be licensed Creative-Commons CC-BY-SA. Source code will be licensed using an appropriate open-source license, e.g. MIT, and contributions must be contributed patent-free. Code, documentation, and notebooks will be made available on Github.\n\nThe roadmap and associated deliverables can be found in the attached proposal summary document.\n\n**Risks**\n\n1.  ***Team Dynamics***: A new team, different time zones and varying commitments.  \n    Addressed by adding team members that have worked together. To help test team dynamics we worked collaboratively to produce proposal artefacts including proposal video.\n2.  ***Key Personnel***: Unable to continue with the project.  \n    Addressed by managing scope, documenting a clear plan and source of material knowledge, collective team learning, and developing in public.\n3.  ***Software Dependency***: Multi-Asset support and Plutus release are delayed.  \n    Addressed by prototype work. We are not building production-ready software. Development can use Plutus playground or private test networks.\n4.  ***Scope***: Too complex and ambitious for team-skill.  \n    Addressed by making content deliverables introductory level, delivering in stages, and making the deep engineering work very specific.\n5.  ***Technical***: approach fails, does not work or not useful.  \n    Addressed by creating two primary sets of deliverables- content, and engineering. Content deliverables are 100% applicable.\n\n**Return on Intention**\n\n**Intention:** Construct a toolkit of material that complements the training material from Cardano Foundation and IOG. Focusing on the application- Smart-Market based on Oracle Pool Architecture- rather than learning Plutus/Haskell. Broadly cover topics that highlight the unique features of Cardano with understandable language, and real-world application; presented meaningfully, and done by relatable others. To get people understanding how they can use the unique features of Cardano, to help them to see the possibilities of building on Cardano.\n\nThese features include Ouroboros's logical clock, the ExUXTO process-oriented transaction model, native custom tokens and meta-data features for NFTs, Plutus, interestingly combining these - a smart-market design that uses an oracle pool— creating a virtuous loop that enhances the revenue opportunities for Stake-Pool Operators. The motivating problem that Smart-Market's enable is multilateral swaps.\n\n**Return:** Developers are inspired to leverage the unique features of Cardano, in a way that reinforces the internal economic logic of the Cardano Network. At least one technology start-up (commercial or social) builds upon the work to target a specific market opportunity.\n\n**Key Performance Indicators**\n\n**Key Metric**: *Project Velocity*\\[3\\], defined as a combination of base activity metric of commits pulled from Github. Team success metric in achieving short-terms targets of topic content delivery, and community impact metric.\n\n**Activity Metrics**: captured as project activity in GitHub and cadence of deliverables, a.) Content delivered; b.) Engineering milestones achieved.\n\n**Community Metrics**: engagement behaviours broken down into *four categories*\\[4\\] for the content we produce, to measure how our work is being spread.\n\n*   ***Validating*** - views, likes, shares\n*   ***Sharing*** - Tweets, Comments, References in documents.\n*   ***Asking & Answering*** - questions asked and answered across channels\n*   ***Exploring*** - Open-ended questions, and conversations about applications\n\nIn addition to content distribution, outreach into other communities will be necessary. For example, we will be actively engaging with the cadCAD and Token Engineering communities to explore the Smart-Market and Oracle Pool design space. Asking and answering, and exploring interactions will be noted as they occur.\n\n**Costs:**\n\nTotal Ask. ADA 981319 ($104K USD) for six months, funding six team members.\n\nBased on a pro-rata hourly rate for the six-team members. The budget takes an FTE of USD$100K. Adjusting for experience, work, individual facilities, and short term nature of the project is used to calculate an hourly rate. The effort assigned: 30% to learning, 55% for production activities, 5% for communication, and 10% for administration overhead. Including some allowance for currency risk.\n\nProduction of five modules includes the team's learning and educational content development (USD $50K). Protocol Engineering (USD $60K). Community Engagement ($15K USD). Thirty per cent of the total budget is discounted to account for individual learning (-$20KUSD).\n\nThe budget balances the need to be fair on team commitment and be efficient in learning and delivery outcomes. Roadmap, deliverables, and KPIs are designed to allow accountability and measure progress in stages. They also have been designed to allow us to be responsive and adapt (in-terms of engagement and content) to the experience of the community.\n\nMore detailed budget break-down can be found in the attached proposal summary document.\n\n**Additional Material**\n\n**Proposal Summary:** https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQJgf57yBH8SkipwaRdjKNvUHAr9VNEaDtTr6V7THajd3YpcPhDjb2Ilrqe82J7pIEpEXxj2InEBlnR/pub?start=false&loop=false\n\n**Proposal** **Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klIMDN4W5sE\n\n**The Cardano Effect Presentation:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXpK3os8s7M&t=1445s\n\n**References**\n\n**\\[1\\] US auction theorists win Economics Prize:** https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54509051\n\n**\\[2\\] Dark Country trading card game**: https://darkcountry.io/\n\n**\\[3\\] CHAOSS Project Velocity:** https://chaoss.community/metric-project-velocity/\n\n**\\[4\\] Community Engagement Framework:** https://communityroundtable.com/best-practices/thecrs-work-out-loud-framework/",

However, with all the parallel conversations, spam, and \"when moon?\" comments, good questions end up lost without an answer.\n\nInteresting people always get overloaded with comments on social media. Important and urgent questions often don't get the deserved attention.\n\nAdditionally, the target user may not have an incentive to spend his time answering.\n\n  \n\n**HOW?**\n\nWith this platform you can ask anything and attach a small crypto donative in ADA to boost your visibility. A smart contract guarantees an answer or your money back.\n\nYour donation is held in escrow on a Cardano smart contract and automatically refunded if you don't get an answer.\n\nThe platform UI will sort the questions based on multiple criteria to maximize gains and avoid refunds due to expiration time.\n\nIn order to avoid spam, a minimum donative value is required. This value is defined by the mentor.\n\n  \n\n**LONG-TERM GOAL**\n\nI hope this becomes a reliable way to get help from professionals around the world while allowing smart people to make some extra income.\n\n  \n\n**TIMELINE & FUND BREAKDOWN**\n\nThe requested amount will fund the development of an MVP for each component of the project: Smart Contract, Backend, iOS, Android and Web.

    "description": "Cardano Hub - your key to the future. The Hub will include meetup space, co-working, library, media, cafe, bookstore, and will focus on the III main directions which correspond to III Cardano phases.\n\nI. Goguen - Meetups, Popularization of Plutus and Marlowe, achieving high-quality developer acquisition, Haskell courses and trainings, assistance to companies that are planning to use Cardano smart-contracts.\n\nII. Basho - We will follow CATO (Cardano Adoption Through Outreach) tactics and will work on interoperability with other blockchains\n\nIII. Voltaire - We will study philosophy, political science, and economics, will research, and come up with ideas that can be used in Cardano governance.\n\nAs the location of the first hub, we propose Kyiv (Ukraine), but we also have ideas and conversations about North-Western Hub (Washington-Wyoming) and Milan (Italy).\n\nThe Cardano HUB in Kyiv can use the CIA technique (Cooperation, Integration, Assimilation) in relation to other blockchains. I.e. with some blockchain and project we cooperate, with some we integrate (like Litecoin or BCH), and some - assimilate (many blockchain projects don't really need own blockchain and they can exist on Cardano blockchain and issue their token.).\n\nThe Cardano HUB will provide a place for meetups for all crypto projects (therefor showing goodwill, for some - for free, for others on the paid basis). The Hub can start as non-profit but then in some time, Hub can become profitable by providing rent for meetups, selling products (like Cardano merchandise and books), and providing consulting for businesses interested in using ADA.\n\nThere used to be Blockchain Hub in Kyiv, which shut down half a year ago (because of rent increase) and crypto community doesn't have a place to gather for meetups, and just for coffee/beer.\n\nIn 2019 I had experience of starting the first literature crypto bar, which I consider success as the convergence of crypto and other fields. We had a great audience, from crypto-entrepreneurs to members of parliament, diplomats, famous artists, and writers. From the point of business, it didn't have enough time to become profitable, and it had to close due to the problem with real estate. (Landlords took bank loan many years ago, and the bank came to claim their property and took over the place). I started it with my own funds, and I didn't expect to earn money on it, as it's just not the type of business where you can expect big profits (it would be much easier just to keep funds in crypto, or stake). But this was an exciting experience, which I would be happy to use in setting up Cardano Hub. (For example, we had big room enough to fit 60 people, but in Cardano Hub we should have a room for several hundred, at least).\n\nIn 2020, just recently Tezos Hub opened in Kyiv (in terms of the grant from Tezos foundation). They will make meetups, hackathons, etc. It's located not in center, so I suppose it will work in \"closed-mode\"\n\nBut my idea of HUB is completely different. Yes, we will make hackathons and meetups. Weekly Cardano meetups, but we will do much more. We will provide meetup space for all crypto-projects (and sometimes beyond crypto). The Hub will work from early morning till night (and maybe even 24 hours in future) and crypto-enthusiasts and all visitors will be able to come, drink coffee, and to know more about Cardano. We will have unique library and unique bookshop - which will attract intellectual people, some of them can join crypto movement. We will create special technical meetups for developers (i.e. Haskell) and will try to achieve high-level developer acquisition for the Cardano ecosystem. We will have a media office there (already existing ones, Cryptotexty, which has sites in Ukrainian, English and youtube channel with 1k+ subscribers) and will provide working space for Cardano-related projects.\n\nAs an option - Cardano Hub can be tokenized, and have multiple owners and governance systems.\n\nIn fact, I think it should be tokenized or to find it's for-profit specialization, as I wouldn't be happy to run Hub on community donations.\n\nLike Cardano is transferring from OBFT to SPO's making blocks, we will try to reach similar transfer in a year.\n\nSo I'm requesting 888 888 ADA which should be enough for 1 year of Cardano Hub functioning.",

(I thought to lover it to 77K as I mentioned in the comment, but after speaking with Ambassador Maria Carmo, I decided to agree with her suggestion and to put the amount which would be more or less equal to 10K of USD. Cardano Media Projects is something which I'm already doing on a smaller scale and which I will do even for free (if the proposal is not submitted), but of course, if you support my proposal - I will be able to focus more on this work.\n\n  \n\nI decided not to stick with the names of the programs (probably I won't use them, leaving them as the reference), but what I promise is to do 2 videos (interviews, programs) a week for the next 6 months or a longer period.\n\nThe main challenge is how to bring developers to the Cardano ecosystem so the main focuses of my programs will be:\n\nI. Goguen and Smart-Contracts/\n\nII. Project Catalyst - as now when Cardano has superior governance - more people should know about, more developers and teams should come and submit their proposals.\n\nIII. Governance and Economic theory, on the way of Cardano's path to becoming next financial system of the world.\n\n  \n\nThese are 3 main directions, but I won't stick to them only, as crypto space is very dynamic and I will stay up to date. Also, I will use all your suggestions and I invite you to collaborate (as guest, as viewer, or maybe even as co-host)\n\n  \n\nRegarding languages - I will focus on Russian and Ukrainian, we will translate to them, and also I will organize Cardano meetups in Kyiv (Ukraine) on a monthly or weekly basis (Let's see how the coronavirus situations goes) - to build and maintain local Cardano community.\n\n  \n\nAll the videos will be published on Cryptotexty youtube with 1K+ subscribers\n\nThen they will be published on my crypto-blogs and crypto platforms which I maintain and grow for the last years.

Read.Cash - 60+ subscribers\n\n12\\. Twitter - Since 2009 - 11k+ followers\n\n___________\n\nHonoring the tradition in the Cardano ecosystem to give names of prominent people to projects, I propose 5 Projects, 5 shows, each will focus on a particular topic.\n\nProject Gaetano - On governance | Project Vilfredo - On tokenomics, cryptoeconomics and economic theory | Project Umberto - On dapps | Project CATO - On marketing strategies, ADA promotion, conversation with Ambassadors (CATO - Cardano Adoption Through Outreach) | Project Cosimo - On trading\n\nSome of the programs will be broadcasted live (Cryptotexty youtube has over 1k subscribers so it's possible to stream live) while others will be recorded on Zoom and published later.\n\nAfter some time, after the audience is built for each program and when there will be many live viewers - we will use the interactive mode more.\n\nWe will make a text version of each show.\n\nEach publication will be also shared on 10+ crypto blog platforms with thousands of total views.\n\nVideos will be also published on LBRY, Dtube.\n\nWe will translate texts to Ukrainian and Russian. In Ukrainian text will be published on Cryptotexty.com Ukrainian site + Hive + occasionally. on lb.ua (one of the top local sites) and dt.ua\n\nIn Russian text will be published on Hub Forklog (one of the top crypto media in the region) + Hive\n\nWe will make at least 2 programs a week, hopefully more.  \n\nWe will align the programs with live meetups when possible and will continue the work towards the creation of Cardano Hub (where media studio will be part of it).\n\nMy video presentation of crypto-background and why I'm interested in the Cardano ecosystem\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vEaYNqzn1s",

    "description": "The first phase of my proposal is to conduct research leveraging my contacts in the Astronomy community, as well as with SpaceX, to determine the physical, financial, and market constraints on a potential line of small scale space telescopes.  \n  \nThe long term intent is to design, build, and launch as many telescopes as there is market demand for with a build cost as low as possible, using off the shelf components. The larger the number of satellites the more the initial design research can be ameliorated.  \n  \nThe planned interface and payment system for this project is ideal ground for a DApp to tie together 4 widely different industries with Cardano. This would drive a market for Ada as the currency of Science, and have a positive impact on public acceptance of Cryptocurrencies and DApps world wide.  \n  \nThe over all social goal is to bridge the gap between Astronomers, and astronomy students who are constantly getting in each others way looking for telescope time, and with SpaceX, OneWeb, and Blue Origin who are building megastructures in orbit that will have profound impacts on uplifting the human race. To create a solution to a problem being created by the conflict between progress, and academics, simultaneously paving a new pathway for new students to enter the field of Astronomy with state of the art technology available to them.",

    "description": "SPOCRA - Stake Pool Operators Collective Representation Assembly:\n\nProtocol health demands Cardano stake pool operators are well educated and well prepared to operate and maintain their nodes effectively. Significant gaps exist relevant to the technical and operational resources currently available to Cardano stake pool operators.\n\nSPOCRA is a unified collaboration of Cardano stake pool operators seeking to implement a structured content deployment infrastructure to address existing and future content gaps as they arise. SPOCRA also intends to establish bidirectional communication bridges between engaged Cardano SPOs and SPOCRA as well as communication channels between SPOCRA and the Cardano Foundation.\n\nEstablishing the framework for these communications channels will assist with both addressing and mitigating the urgency of future content gaps - while ensuring the Cardano Foundation maintains an adequate broad-range pulse of the Cardano stake pool operator community. SPOCRA also aims to influence protocol health via SPO education while promoting a positive commercial ecosystem on behalf of participating SPOs.\n\n\n\n\n\n SPOCRA will use funds to actively engage in the following initiatives:\n\nestablish a transparent organization to manage funds and to facilitate day-to-day operational activities\n\nmaintain the health of the Cardano protocol via producing and disseminating high quality educational content targeting Cardano stake pool operators\n\nestablish viable communication bridges to enable bidirectional dialogue to occur between the wider stake pool operator community and the Cardano Foundation\n\nadvocate for, and promote, a healthy and sustainable commercial environment on behalf of participating Cardano stake pool operators\n\n\n\n\n\n Specific Educational Goals:\n\nSPOCRA will produce educational content addressing the following topics:\n\n\\- linux: linux basics; operations and commands SPOs will need\n\n\\- linux: security basics for SPOs; locking down nodes, firewalls\n\n\\- linux: advanced security\n\n\\- GitHub: usage\n\n\\- cardano: cold key management; secure transaction signing\n\n\\- cardano: building a node\n\n\\- cardano: operating a node\n\n\\- cardano: monitoring nodes\n\n\\- cardano: up- and downgrading\n\n\\- cardano: marketing basics; web, SEO, social media and content production\n\n\n\n\n\n Specific Communication Goals:\n\nEstablish funnels to build up email mailing lists, organized into interest buckets, consisting of Cardano stake pool operators, delegators and wider community stakeholders. In building the foundations to engage targeted communication channels establishes effective outbound communication channels and enables ability to engage in interest-specific campaigns. Such targeted campaigns would include urgent updates for stake pool operators, and campaigns targeting delegator interests such as broader urgent education, SPO marketing, support for stake pool bootstrap, and women involvement initiatives as example.\n\nEstablish formal communication bridges between SPOCRA and the Cardano Foundation and between SPOCRA and significant ecosystem stakeholders such as IOG and Emurgo.\n\nEstablish formal communication channels between the broader SPOCRA operator community and SPOCRA.\n\nEstablish informal communication channels between SPOCRA and the broader Cardano stake pool operator community willing to contribute feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding:\n\n\n\n SPOCRA will pursue funding in stages. For this first stage, SPOCRA is seeking 100k Ada for the following:\n\n1.  Legal; establish the SPOCRA organization (15,000 Ada)\n\n\n\n2\\. Establish a reusable framework for video content production: reusable graphics, templates, intro and outro video segments (5,000 Ada)\n\n\n\n3\\. Produce urgently needed educational content series targeting SPOs to address the critical gaps relevant to linux security and cold key management education:\n\n\\- Initial SPO \"Best Security Practices\" document (20,000 Ada)\n\n\\- \"Cold Key Management\" tutorial video (10,000 Ada)\n\n\\- Basic Linux for stake pool operators tutorial video (5,000 Ada)\n\n\\- Linux Security and best practices for stake pool operators tutorial video (10,000 Ada)\n\n\\- Advanced Linux Security for SPOs tutorial video (10,000 Ada)\n\n\n\n4\\. Establish a communications framework and begin building out all target communication lists and channels (10,000 Ada).\n\n\n\n5\\. Operational costs and tools (15,000 Ada).\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline:\n\n\n\n SPOCRA expects to have successfully produced and deployed no less than 75% of target content within 60 days following receipt of funds. SPOCRA also expects to have completed any remaining target content and objectives outlined in this proposal no later than 90 days following receipt of funds.\n\n\n\nThe process of accepting and awarding bids for content and operational deliverables under this proposal will be refined and determined by the SPOCRA community following the conclusion of the SPOCRA Creation Committee election which is currently active.\n\n\n\n Upon reaching milestones, SPOCRA will pursue subsequent funding rounds to continue executing upon SPOCRA's content and communications strategies.",

The system will be free to the users and be as decentralised and open as possible.\n\nThe system is aiming to improve a person's Fitness, Mental Health & Mindfulness by gently providing goals for them to achieve. The system will integrate with various hardware devices and online libraries/tools.\n\nWellbeing effects everyone in their lifetime and there is a real urgent need to research and understand how people's mental state affects their lives, jobs and family.\n\nCurrent software applications concentrate on one element of people's lives whether it's fitness, mental health or mindfulness. In truth we are all driven by different needs throughout our life and throughout the day. A fitness fanatic one day with Bi-polar can be crippled another day and there daily goal is not to walk an extra 1km, it's just to get out of bed and make it through the day.\n\nThe 'FOX Rewards' project will adapt to the day-to-day struggles and highs gently suggesting self-help where it can and encouraging general fitness when appropriate. Fitness is proved to be a great advocate in the fight to help mental health, but if the person cannot even face the postman how are they going to get the motivation to run a mile?\n\nLots of mental health issues are hidden and self-help is an amazing way to reach out.\n\n'FOX Rewards' is aimed at the following:\n\n*   Improve the personal fitness of a user of any ability\n*   Improve Mental Health and offer resources to help self-healing\n*   Improve Mindfulness via meditating and online community shared resources\n\nThe system will encourage an online community to build and share content and will offer initial self-healing to those who may be struggling from day-to-day life. It will also contain links and other help resources should situations escalate and the help of more professional services is required.\n\nThere will be many ways to earn rewards via the gamification style system such as:\n\n*   Completing Daily Fitness tasks e.g. walk xx Miles, take xx Steps\n*   Daily cumulative workouts\n*   Listen to podcasts\n*   POI Check-in\n*   Watch mindful videos\n*   Book and attend fitness courses\n*   etc. \n\n***A simple daily starting questionnaire will decide the route of the application (see attachments)***\n\n**Partnerships**\n\nAt the heart of the rewards will be partnerships with gyms, health clubs, sports facilities, local authorities, online resources, schools and others offering services within the 3 main core areas.\n\n**Fitness**\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nThe Fitness system will learn metrics from previous days and will gently encourage the user to increase their levels by a % per day. It will reward their effort and recalculate new targets each month.\n\n**Courses**\n\nBooking a fitness course will be rewarded along with attendance.\n\n**Hardware & APIs**\n\nThe use of Fitness devices such as Fitbit will be encouraged as there are APIs that can be used to cut down the level of cheating that such an eco-system may find itself in. The automation of the results is key and there is already a working prototype that can connect and import the users Fitbit daily activity. The Fitbit API will also allow the full history of the user to be imported, allowing the system to have a great indication of their level and instantly reward the user for the previous 6 months activity.\n\nThere are plans to work with many other hardware devices and software API's such as Apple Fit, Google Fit, Strava etc.\n\n**Places of Interest (POI) Check-in**\n\nGPS will aid the check-in facility and this will be rewarded, examples of this could be a gym check-in or a point of interest such as walking to the top of a beauty spot.\n\n**Rewards**\n\nThe main motivation for the user will be the rewards system and there will be multiple forms of rewards to encourage continuous use of the system:\n\n*   Reward Points will be given to achieving goals\n*   Level-Ups will be given by achieving point milestones\n*   Cryptocurrency tokens will be given by achieving point milestones\n\nThe reward points can be redeemed within the e-commerce section of the system as follows:\n\n*   Trade reward points for discounts of items in the shop\n*   Trade reward points for discounts off fitness courses\n\n**Mental Health**\n\nThe Mental Health aspect of the system will be treated very sensitively and we are aware not everyone has motivation to be fit when the help they require is often support. The professional and community self-help library will aim to offer initial support for people who need gentle encouragement, as well as offer insight into other areas that may help such as Fitness and/or Mindfulness.\n\nThere will be help and support for when situations are escalating and will encourage the user to reach out if things take a turn for the worse or thoughts are getting out of hand.\n\n**Mindfulness**\n\nIntroducing a 5 minute meditation or podcast into the start or end of the day can really help to escape life's stresses or set you up in the right mind set to start the day.\n\nFor those lucky people with no mental health issues, the introduction to meditation and fitness goals could enrich their lives even more.\n\nDuring the day a quick way to access resources that can help with panic attacks or racing minds can sometimes help to ease the mind.\n\nIn addition sleep can be improved for some people by getting into a regular habit of listening to a podcast and doing breathing exercises. These will be available in the professional and community based library.\n\n**Medical Research**\n\nCombining Fitness, Mental Health and Mindfulness together in one eco-system should be able to create interesting anonymous data studies to further enhance wellbeing studies.\n\n**'FOX Rewards' Project Requirements**\n\nThe project requires the following:\n\n*   Main Website\n*   About Us, How To, Registration etc.\n*   Fitness, Mental Health and Mindfulness Sections\n*   A Prototype is currently being built for the Fitness section\n*   Fitness Hardware/API integration\n*   Already compatible with Fitbit\n*   Roadmap\n*   Apple Fit, Google Fit, Strava etc\n*   Mobile application – Apple iOS and Google Android versions\n*   Partnerships with gyms, health clubs, sports facilities, local authorities, online resources, schools and others required\n*   E-commerce Shop\n*   Products such as Fitbit devices, t-shirts etc.\n*   Partner offers and discounts\n*   Course booking\n*   Library Resources\n*   Community built podcasts, articles, videos\n*   Professional built podcasts, articles, videos\n*   Partnership built podcasts, articles, videos\n\n**Mind Map**\n\n***The following is a high level mind map of the system (see attachment)***\n\n**What does the current team look like?**\n\nI have a small team of developers, testers and analysts at my disposal that have worked together on many projects. I am self-funding the project. I hope one day to have an established company with full time employees but at the moment I am a start-up bootstrapping alongside my full time job.\n\nThe current team is as follows:\n\n**Rob – Founder**\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-greig-2076b053/\n\nRob is a serial entrepreneur, building businesses and developing software for 20 years in various industries. Highly skilled developer and Business Analyst. Previously built an estate agent monitoring system and an advanced automated backend/cloud API business that was sold to one of the largest UK estate agent portals (Fish4) and media company 'Trinity Mirror'.\n\nExcels in software planning, development, management along with building and mentoring small to medium development teams.\n\n**Ant - Founder**\n\nAnt is a serial entrepreneur, building businesses and testing software for 20 years in various industries. Fully Trained software tester previously worked for large high street companies (Maginus/Torex Retail/PC World/Matalan) testing their in-store user systems. Was part of the same company that built Agent Analyser and House Fusion later sold to 'Trinity Mirror'.\n\n**Dave – Lead Developer**\n\nDave is a highly experienced and loyal web and API developer that has worked for small and large companies and worked with the original Rockstar Games (Grand Theft Auto). Energetic and a team player who loves to explore new technology.\n\n**David – Developer**\n\nDavid is a youthful experienced and loyal web developer that has worked for small and large companies and is trained in Salesforce CRM development.\n\n**Callum – Social Media Marketing**\n\nCallum is a talented Photoshop and Video creator who has previously helped Luxury Car Showrooms build their Instagram followers from 0 to 300k in 3 months. With a keen eye for Photography and editing he is an asset to any team.\n\n**Future Positions**\n\nThere are plans for more developers, analysts, admin, sales and marketing employees if larger funds became available and the project gained traction.\n\n**What will the Cardano Funds be used for?**\n\nI will use the Cardano funds to complete the development of the main website and to build the Minimal Viable Product which will then enable the system to be presented to potential partners/customers/investors\n\nAnt and I will continue to bootstrap the project and will not take any wage for ourselves and contribute an additional £7,500 to the fund to go towards wages and other costs.\n\nHaving worked on the project plan in more detail I would require funding for 2-3 people for 6 months working out to be approximately 90,000 ADA.\n\nI am planning on staking 15k of ADA and hope the price would have appreciated in 6-9 months - this should lead to the project self-funding itself for a length of time. If the funds run out I will continue to bootstrap the project and look for other ways to monetise the project.\n\n**Roadmap**\n\n*   Complete Fitness area of the website to complete the MVP\n*   Partner with a number of gyms, health facilities and build the e-commerce shop for booking courses and offering products and discounts\n*   Partner with a number of gyms and schools\n*   The Mental Health and Mindfulness sections will be built following further funding of the system\n\n**What does success look like from Fund2?**\n\nTo have the Fitness section of the main website and integration with Fitbit fully automated, and also to have the e-commerce shop working with a small number of partners.\n\nInitially I would like to trial the system with a small number of partners then build to expand the system to their other branches/franchises.\n\nI would like to have 5 gyms (or similar) on board within the first 6 months before the large rollout happens.\n\n**Future Funding and Enhancements**\n\nThe website will be updated with feedback from the trials and start to build the remaining options.\n\nThe project is large and could grow quite rapidly after it has gained traction, but to begin with there is a large amount of development that is required so the project will need a larger investment for it to grow to its full potential.\n\nI would like to build a large social media following via YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc. as this has worked very well in growing previous brands my team and I have worked on.\n\n**What value does 'FOX Rewards' bring to Cardano?**\n\n'FOX Rewards' offers a unique reward system and can be disruptive to the wellbeing sector.\n\nThe mathematical and scientific approach of Cardano shares the same values and fundamentals as my team and I. We want to associate our product with the Cardano brand and would hope Cardano in turn will want to associate with our product and brand for the same reason.\n\nWe are looking for a long term disruptive partner that can understand the vision we have and believe Cardano is the right company and block chain to align with.\n\nWe don't want our successful business to be built upon Ethereum for example - a block chain that could fail in a few years because the foundations they were built upon crumble, leaving us in an unstable position. Ethereum and others that were quick to market will be shown long-term to be playing catch-up with Cardano - we can't wait or take the chance on a project that is running 1000 miles down the track to try and change their engine mid-race.\n\nThe decentralised and community-led element of the 'FOX Rewards' eco-system will help the project to grow, and at every possible step we will shine the light of Cardano.\n\nWe hope 'FOX Rewards' will ultimately change people's lives forever and give them some hope and release from the crippling disease that is mental health.\n\n**Appendix A**\n\n***Screenshots from the current working prototype (see attachments)***\n\nLogin screen\n\nMain dashboard\n\nSmart Goals calculated from previous data\n\nFitbit API integration",

I will look to make videos on diverse topics explaining Goguen, Basho, Hydra, and Atala.\n\nThe requested funds are for a series of short videos amounting to 30 minutes of footage in total – not including what I have already made (which is about 11 mins in total so far).\n\nAfter I have completed the 30 minutes – I will likely continue making these videos as I enjoy making them. I want my videos to communicate how Cardano works, and why it is superior to other blockchain platforms.\n\nThese videos will energize Cardano-enthusiasts, but their primary purpose is to attract developers into the Cardano eco-system.\n\nThe requested funds will allow me to make more effective videos. At the moment, I am limited to using free-to-use stock footage for my videos. This grant will allow me to purchase a subscription to a proper stock video footage platform, such as \"Artgrid\".\n\nFrequency: I will make a new clip every 2 weeks.\n\nTimeframe: the 30-minute assignment will be complete within 6 months. However, I will likely continue making videos even after this quota has been met.\n\nCost breakdown:\n\nI am requesting 70,000 ADA – which at today's value of roughly 10 cents is $7,000 USD.\n\nIt takes me 2 and a half days to make a 2-minute video in the same style as my videos entitled \"Three Billion People\", \"SingularityNET\", and \"One World Market\". This means it takes me about 20 hours to make a 2-minute video.\n\n30 minutes will therefore require about 300 hours of work.\n\n300 hours of work at $20/hour is $6,000 USD\n\nSubscribing to a proper stock video footage platform is about $300/year for HD video. See: https://artgrid.io/pricing\n\nThe remaining $700 would go to basic overhead costs, and purchasing royalty-free music to use in these videos.",

We call these components dStore, dNET and dComp...\n\nFrom the perspective of complexity, designing decentralized, distributed storage is somewhat simple, and many projects in this area already exists, namely it would be SIA, Storj and Filecoin as leaders, however each of these projects use their own tokens and some even use own blockchain which we consider unnecessary. We would combine features of Filecoin and Storj and add some other innovative improvements into which I would rather not get into right now. But for instance, combination of Storj model with the zero-knowledge cryptography from Filecoin would provide already a huge benefit.\n\nThere are several storage types used in the industry, mainly it would be persistent storage and ephemeral storage. When it comes to persistent storage, they are also classified by longevity ranging from days all the way to so-called forever retention widely used in pharma and finance verticals.\n\nAnother factor to consider when it comes to Data Storage services is time-to-first-byte, bandwidth and latency, we have planned a complex Service Level Offering suitable for wide range of different providers and wide range of services.\n\nSecond easiest domain to tackle is networking, in the area of networking, there are several sub-domains when it comes to networking, while we have many ideas in this area, we will keep them to ourselves until second funding round. But they would enable dCloud to provide dVPNs, dCDNs, dDDoS protection and other services.\n\nMost of the projects in all three pillar areas suffer from using own, custom tokens for payment from consumers, and also reward service providers in these tokens, which causes variety of usability issues, effectively harming addoption. In our model, we would prefer consumers to pay in already established assets such as ADA or native Cardano stablecoin, thus reducing volatility for both consumers and service providers alike.\n\nThe third, most difficult area is compute, with current technology, this is a very tricky part to be done securely, one could use something like Intel SGX or ARM TrustZone to execute secret code by untrusted service providers, however we would personally prefer to wait for viable RISC-V processors which, given their open-source nature should provide more security and further supply chain diversification, which would improve resistence even against Advanced Persistent Threats. We expect viable hardware to be on the market within 3 years with the current pace of development in the RISC-V and OpenPOWER ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal benefits both regular Cardano users who may consume the services, Cardano dApps developers as it provides them with the infrastructure required to run off-chain code and store data in decentralized, distributed manner as well as tech savy infrastructure providers such as Stake Pool Operators, who may, in addition to running stakepools also run dCloud infrastructure and gain additional revenue streams.\n\nExamples of applications that may leverage this sort of infrastructure would be (short list):\n\n\\* GitHub alternative - both Cardano core components and Cardano dApps (as well as all other open-source projects) require some sort of a Source Code Management system, it would be relatively easy to move 75% of GitLab onto this platform, with the remaining 25% requiring some additional work, but it could still be done over time, as soon as we would get the compute part figured out, which is just a matter of time as the R&D is already ongoing by other silicon companies...\n\nIn addition, Cardano has already need to develop such solution for Decentralized Software Updates, see: https://github.com/input-output-hk/decentralized-software-updates/issues/150\n\n\\* Spotify / Apple Music alternative - artist identity, song metadata… may be stored on-chain… but actual music files in different quality would be stored off chain on a Decentralized Cloud Platform\n\n\\* Netflix / Hulu alternative - use-case similar to Spotify / Apple Music Alternative\n\n\\* Wikipedia alternative\n\n\\* YouTube alternative - recently, many people are frightened by the number of censorship / curation platforms like YouTube do, Decentralized Cloud Platform would provide foundation for building decentralized alternative\n\nTL; DR I have seen many proposals here, which would benefit from a Decentralized Cloud Platform such as this, because storing all the required data on-chain would not be feasible from a financial perspective as well as it would just cause unnecessary chain size bloat…\n\nDELIVERABLES:\n\n\\* Implementation of dSTORE MVP enabling service providers to join the marketplace\n\n\\* Proposal for few high value applications such as end-point backup client, for instance cloud backup is ~ 10 bn. / year industry\n\n\\* Competitive Market Analysis of already existing decentralized and centralized solutions\n\n\\* Research of governance model make effective decision about roadmap priorities\n\n\\* Business plan, incl. total addressable market, partner identification, ...",

    "description": "**Overview**\n\nFOX Funds is a low cost smart contract based middleware platform that allows projects to be gifted funds by donations or using P2P trading and reward distribution.\n\nThe gifts are sent as either Fiat Currency (such as British Pound £ or American Dollar $ etc.) or Digital Currency (such as Bitcoin BTC, Ethereum ETH, Cardano ADA, Ripple XRP etc.) by users known in this document as FOX Gifters.\n\nFOX Funds is aimed at the following:\n\n*   One-off Activity - Donations / Fund Raising for a good cause, friend in need or a local event.\n    \n*   Project Fund Raising – software development start-up funds, personal project such as building an extension to my house for a child's playroom, charity funding etc.\n    \n*   This could be a one-off event or ongoing\n    \n\nThere will be 3 ways to gift to a project:\n\n*   Support via Staking\n*   Donate Crypto Currency\n*   Donate Fiat Currency\n\n**FOX Gifters**\n\nThe FOX Gifter agrees to support a project financially for a length of time. The FOX Gifter may specifically choose a project, or a project is chosen on their behalf if they have delegated the gifting decision to someone else e.g. a stake pool or charity.\n\n**Funding Process**\n\nWhen a project is created the following happens:\n\n*   Any gifted Cryptocurrency to a project if not ADA is converted to ADA to undergo Staking or converted to a Stable Coin (eventually a Cardano stable coin). The choice is the preference of the Project creator\n    \n*   Advantage of ADA is staking rewards but the price volatility could lead to less money being finally delivered to the project (better suited for the bull market)\n    \n*   Advantage of stable coin is the donation sent to the project remains the same as donated but does not increase in value (better suited for the bear market)\n    \n*   Any gifted ADA to a project immediately undergoes staking.\n    \n*   If the user has chosen to gift their Cardano Staked rewards this should be directed to the project fund (note: only rewards go to the fund not the ADA that is being staked).\n    \n\nFOX Gifts & Fund Raising aims to return more value than donations would have done using traditional Fiat tender.\n\nThe owner of the project receives a market reward based on the value of the fund plus any additional rewards that were earned through staking.\n\n**Funding Lifecycle**\n\n1.  A new project is listed on the FOX Gifts & Fund Raising platform.\n2.  Gifters can permanently gift Fiat or Digital Currency to the project.\n\n*   The gifts are staked to earn interest.\n\n1.  The FOX Gifter can also gift all or a percentage of the rewards they receive from staking ADA on a Cardano Staking Pool.\n\n*   The FOX Gifter can stop the staking rewards from going to the project at any time **– note: the staked ADA is not given to the project, only the rewards.**\n\n1.  The project owner can withdraw their 'FOX Funds' according to the smart contract and the rewards created by the staking will be divided according to the 'Project Funding Policy'.\n\nThe owner of the project initially owns 100% of the ownership rights - this means they are entitled to 100% of the market rewards. The ownership rights can be transferred to single or multiple people and the market rewards will be distributed based on the ownership ratio if the owner wishes.\n\n**Donations**\n\nFiat Currency Donations are converted to a stable coin. This will eventually be a Cardano stable coin and maybe available to stake to earn rewards.\n\nWhen the project donation period ends (determined by the Project owners Smart Contract) the 'FOX Funds' any staking is stopped and interest gained through released and the user can withdraw them.\n\n**Staking**\n\nStaking is used in 'FOX Funds' as a new payment system that enables rewards to be received for projects. Staking increases market rewards through the temporary deposit of ADA on a Cardano staking pool. The market rewards for staking are owned by the project owner(s) according to their ownership ratio.\n\nWhen the staking period ends (determined by the project owners Smart Contract) the 'FOX Funds' staked in the project are released and the user can withdraw them.\n\nThe Staking pool is chosen at random or can be specifically chosen from a list of stake pools that are subscribed to the 'FOX Funds' platform.\n\n**Stake Pools**\n\nStake pools that subscribe to the 'FOX Funds' platform will be given 'web integration code' so projects can be created, viewed and funded on their website.\n\nAny projects created on the stake pools own website will automatically be staked to that pool (the option to change stake pool provider will be hidden)\n\nThe stake pool operator will gain the following benefits:\n\n*   Great opportunity to increase the amount staked on their pool\n*   Unique service to offer to their clients (people who stake)\n*   Ability to attract new clients\n*   Have an additional way to interact with their clients and have access to any emails/contacts created via their website\n\n**FOX Gifts Project Requirements**\n\nThe project requires the following:\n\n*   Main Website\n    \n*   About Us, How To, Registration etc.\n    \n*   Create/Edit Projects\n    \n*   A description of the project that requires funds is created along with any supporting documentation\n    \n*   Set the fundraising goal\n    \n*   Tell the story\n    \n*   Add pictures of videos\n    \n*   Share the Project\n    \n*   Send emails\n    \n*   Send Text Messages\n    \n*   Share on Social Media\n    \n*   Manage Donations\n    \n*   Accept Donations\n    \n*   Fiat Currency\n    \n*   Crypto Currency - ADA & others\n    \n*   Accept/manage Staking Rewards (all or percentage of rewards)\n    \n*   Thank donors\n    \n*   Withdraw funds\n    \n*   Project Contract / Funding Policy\n    \n*   The project has an active status of Inactive, Live, Complete, Cancelled\n    \n*   The project has a visible status of Public, Private or Draft (whilst the Project is being initialised and is not Live)\n    \n*   Choose stake pool\n    \n*   the stake pool to which ADA will be staked is selected, this could be:\n    \n*   'let the system choose' where an unsaturated pool will be chosen at random\n    \n*   'Specific Stake Pool' where a named pool will be searched and used for staking\n    \n*   A Start and End date of the funding is chosen\n    \n*   This can be a fixed date or left ongoing forever to be closed whenever the project owner decides\n    \n*   A template may be used to setup the project\n    \n*   A dashboard for the project is created along with a dedicated link that can be shared to the public\n    \n*   Withdrawal Schedule – this could be\n    \n*   'at any time', 'when goal is achieved or project closed', 'each time xxx is earnt', 'every xx days' etc.\n    \n*   The project is searchable on the main FOX Funds website if not marked as Private\n    \n*   Smart Contract creation for each Project\n    \n*   Stake/Un stake ADA on chosen Stake Pool\n    \n*   Receive Funds - Crypto Wallet or Fiat Bank to FOX Funds\n    \n*   Convert Fiat Currency to Cardano stable coin and vice versa\n    \n*   Convert Crypto Currency to ADA ready for Staking\n    \n*   Update project funds with Staking Rewards\n    \n*   Withdraw currency from FOX Funds to final destination – Crypto Wallet or Fiat Bank\n    \n*   Mobile Application will be part of the roadmap and make it much more accessible\n    \n*   Stake Pool Tools\n    \n*   Registration for Stake Pools\n    \n*   Stake Pools / FOX Funds Contract\n    \n*   Create code for Stake Pools so Projects can be created directly from their website\n    \n*   Automatically chooses their Stake Pool as the chosen pool\n    \n*   Mobile application – Apple iOS and Google Android versions\n    \n\n**Process Flow**\n\nThe following is a high level overview of the process.\n\n(see attachment) \n\n**What does the current team look like?**\n\nI have a small team of developers, testers and analysts at my disposal that have worked together on many projects. I am self-funding the project. I hope one day to have an established company with full time employees but at the moment I am a start-up bootstrapping alongside my full time job.\n\nThe current team is as follows:\n\n**Rob – Founder**\n\n**https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-greig-2076b053/**\n\nRob is a serial entrepreneur, building businesses and developing software for 20 years in various industries. Highly skilled developer and Business Analyst. Previously built an estate agent monitoring system and an advanced automated backend/ cloud API business that was sold to one of the largest UK estate agent portals (Fish4) and media company 'Trinity Mirror'.\n\nExcels in software planning, development, management along with building and mentoring small to medium development teams.\n\n**Ant - Founder**\n\nAnt is a serial entrepreneur, building businesses and testing software for 20 years in various industries. Fully Trained software tester previously worked for large high street companies (Maginus/Torex Retail/PC World/Matalan) testing their in-store user systems. Was part of the same company that built Agent Analyser and House Fusion later sold to 'Trinity Mirror'.\n\n**Dave – Lead Developer**\n\nDave is a highly experienced and loyal web and API developer that has worked for small and large companies and worked with the original Rockstar Games (Grand Theft Auto). Energetic and a team player who loves to explore new technology.\n\n**David – Developer**\n\nDavid is a youthful experienced and loyal web developer that has worked for small and large companies and is trained in Salesforce CRM development.\n\n**Callum – Social Media Marketing**\n\nCallum is a talented Photoshop and Video creator who has previously helped Luxury Car Showrooms build their Instagram followers from 0 to 300k in 3 months. With a keen eye for Photography and editing he is an asset to any team.\n\n**Future Positions**\n\nThere are plans for more developers, analysts, admin, sales and marketing employees if larger funds became available and the project gained traction.\n\n**What will the Cardano Funds be used for?**\n\nI will use the Cardano funds to pay for the development of the main website.\n\nAnt and I will continue to bootstrap the project and will not take any wage for ourselves and contribute an additional £7,500 to the fund to go towards wages and other costs.\n\nI would require funding for 3-4 people for 6 months which on top of the money I am providing working out to be approximately 100,000 ADA.  \n\nI am planning on staking 22k of ADA and hope the price would have appreciated in 6-9 months - this should lead to the project self-funding itself for a good length of time. If the funds run out I will continue to bootstrap the project and look for other ways to monetise the project.  \n\n**Roadmap**\n\n*   Build website to create projects\n*   Partner with 1-3 stake pools\n*   The reward options will be built up over time in the following order\n*   Support via Staking\n*   Donate Crypto Currency\n*   Donate Fiat Currency\n\n**What does success look like from Fund2?**\n\nTo have the main website and the 'Support via Staking' funding working.\n\nInitially I would like to trial the system with a small number of stake pools then build to offering the system to them all.\n\nI would like to have 100 projects created within the first 6 months before the large rollout happens.\n\n**Future Funding and Enhancements**\n\nI will need to update the website with feedback from the initial trials and start to build the remaining funding options, this would involve researching Fiat onboarding, Cardano stable coin and lending as these are not currently available.\n\nAs the system will not be generating income for the initial 6 months I foresee it would require more funding to continue the project.\n\nI would like to build a large social media following via YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc. as this has worked very well to grow previous brands my team and myself have previously worked on.\n\n**What value does FOX Funds bring to Cardano?**\n\nFOX Gifts & Fund Raising is aimed at building on top of existing Cardano stake pool infrastructure and offering a new Use Case for Staking Pools.\n\nIt will encourage ADA to be staked and be locked up for periods of time, which is very positive for the price of ADA and encourages Stake Pools to promote their services.\n\nThe charity, donations and crowd sourcing project sector is extremely large worldwide and are always looking at new innovative ways to generate income. The Unique Selling point of FOX Funds is the donations should actually return more revenue than is pledged and be a great ambassador for Cardano.",

At the same time, I will continue to coordinate with other Catalyst members in Discord as we assemble a small team for the first steps.\n\nWe will then add internal Gitcoin channels for Haskell development, with specializations for Plutus and Marlowe (for now, can expand on this later). At this point, we will coordinate with other Fund2 development projects about accelerating productivity and meeting targets. We will explore potential resources on Gitcoin that can help with Cardano-native applications that are decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant, such as Web3.\n\nThe goal will be to demonstrate Cardano's competitive edge as a utility network to Solidity developers already networked on Gitcoin and affiliates thereof, and promote our presence as a viable channel of commerce for other digital networks of distributed systems. I am asking for a small amount so we can initiate a preliminary project for contributing grants/bounties on Gitcoin via voting on Voltaire and donating on Yoroi (this includes contribution to the work already being done by Emurgo), as this would greatly impact our ability to invite other contributors and laypersons to help with sustaining the Cardano enterprise externally, and help spread Cardano's vision via the high visibility patronage of open source development.",

Budget is based on 60k transcripted words per month, any quantity above that will be included in the same budget, meaning that no increase in budget will be required.\n\nBudget per word is $0.017 (this includes transcription, dubbing, editing, publishing)\n\nMonthly: 60k words x $0.017 = $1,020\n\nx 6 months = $6,120\n\n**Auditability**:\n\nAll published video materials can be checked through the Youtube and LBRY channels. Each video has its respective transcription published in the Cardano Forum. A biweekly report will be submitted informing about the published content with the number of transcripted words. Length of videos solemnly depends on the original material, on average, 60k translated words per month should represent around 375 mins of video.\n\n  \n\n**Cardano en Español**\n\n**Declaración del problema**:\n\nFalta de contenido en Español para el Proyecto Cardano\n\n**Describa su solución al problema:**\n\nProporcionar materiales de video educando y manteniendo informada a la comunidad hispana sobre el proyecto Cardano\n\nExperiencia relevante:\n\n\\+ 600 videos publicados (Youtube & LBRY)\n\n+1.7k Suscriptores\n\n+130k Total de visitas\n\n+12k Tiempo total de reproducción (horas)\n\n**Plan detallado (no es necesario) - Rellene aquí cualquier detalle adicional :**\n\nLa comunidad hispana Cardano es la segunda en tamaño y está creciendo rápidamente. Sin embargo, aún no se ha publicado ningún contenido oficial en español.\n\nEl plan es financiarse y continuar con el trabajo que ya se está haciendo desde hace + 1 de año (transcripción + doblaje + edición + publicación)\n\nProporcionar a la comunidad hispana materiales educativos relevantes y mantenerla actualizada con las últimas noticias y comunicados del ecosistema Cardano. La mayoría de los contenidos traducidos provienen de los canales de youtube de Charles Hoskinson, IOHK, Emurgo, Fundación Cardano y The Cardano Effect.\n\nLa comunidad hispana está formada por +20 países. Proporcionar contenido Cardano en español es relevante no sólo para la comunidad actual, sino también para todos los futuros miembros hispanos que se embarcarán en el ecosistema Cardano, el contenido ya estará disponible para ellos en los años venideros. Hacer una comunidad Cardano hispana más fuerte significa hacer una comunidad Cardano mundial más fuerte.\n\nEl total de palabras transcritas en español ya debería estar cerca de un millón, incluso el idioma inglés no tiene este \"activo\". Procesarlas a través de un traductor (como Deepl) podría producir una versión bastante precisa de las transcripciones en otros idiomas (francés, portugués, etc.). Varios otros idiomas podrían producir un resultado similar con un presupuesto y una carga de trabajo significativamente menores basando su trabajo en las transcripciones en español ya disponibles.\n\n**Presupuesto:**\n\nPara que el contenido sea publicado en español, primero se requiere una transcripción, lo cual es por lejos la tarea que más tiempo consume. El promedio actual de palabras transcritas por mes es de alrededor de 85 mil. El presupuesto se basa en 60 mil palabras transcritas por mes, cualquier cantidad por encima de esa cantidad se incluirá en el mismo presupuesto, lo que significa que no se requerirá ningún aumento en el presupuesto.\n\nEl presupuesto por palabra es de 0,017 dólares (esto incluye transcripción, doblaje, edición, publicación)\n\nMensualmente: 60 mil palabras x 0,017 dólares = 1.020 dólares\n\nx 6 meses = 6.120 dólares\n\n**Auditabilidad:**\n\nTodos los materiales de video publicados pueden ser revisados a través de los canales de Youtube y LBRY. Cada video tiene su respectiva transcripción publicada en el Foro Cardano. Se presentará un informe quincenal informando sobre el contenido publicado con el número de palabras transcritas. La duración de los videos depende solemnemente del material original, en promedio, 60 mil palabras traducidas por mes deberían representar alrededor de 375 minutos de video.\n\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_fc4Qy1qVIO7A0pqU5AoQ\n\nLBRY: https://open.lbry.com/@cardanocastellano:2?r=5qRC4PT2kohge7RN7vFp2a3eHf7Ncu6f (+300 Subs, +3.8k Total de Visitas)",

    "solutionDescription": "The Cardano Stake Pool Library will offer summaries, category filtering etc to enable a better way to choose a pool that suits your values",
    "outcomeObjectives": null,
    "description": "**Overview**\n\nThe current method to choose a stake pool is very technical and there is no way to distinguish one stake pool from another without visiting each url - which will just not happen.\n\nUsers will either choose an entry off the first screen in the app (which may be saturated so will not be the best choice) or they will choose one by visiting *https://adapools.org/* and looking at the first page. They may even visit a few websites but with 1167 stake pools and rising (at the time of this proposal) the playing field is not fair.\n\nThe ***Cardano Stake Pool Library*** will offer many ways for the user to investigate and filter the stake pool list to help them be better informed of who they are ultimately supporting with their ADA.\n\n**Technical Filters**\n\nFilter by stake pool on the following:\n\n*   up time\n*   saturation\n*   number of created blocks\n*   (ROA) return on ADA (ROA)\n*   fees\n*   pledge\n*   number of delegates\n*   total delegated\n\n**Non-Technical Filters**\n\n*   country of origin\n*   number of employees/owners\n*   type of business\n*   values/beliefs\n*   lots more to be decided\n\n**Tags**\n\nUp to 10 tags can be added by the Stake Pool operator to further define their proposition.\n\n**Stake Pool Summary**\n\nThe stake pool operator will be invited to populate their stake pools information giving them the chance to stand out from the crowd by explaining what makes them different; this could be hosting setup, their beliefs, values etc.\n\n*   brief description\n*   long description\n*   website details\n*   social media details – Facebook, Twitter, Telegram etc.\n*   logo\n*   why choose us? area\n\n**API**\n\nThe ***Cardano Stake Pool Library*** will have an API that can be used by developers to integrate the stake pool details into their applications.\n\n**WIKI**\n\nThe Cardano Stake Pool Library will have lots of technical and non-technical articles to help developers, stake pool operators and the wider community. Examples are detailed explanation of the Stake Pool parameters, how to setup a stake pool, how to choose a stake pool etc\n\n**What does the current team look like?**\n\nI have a small team of developers, testers and analysts at my disposal that have worked together on many projects. I am self-funding the project. I hope one day to have an established company with full time employees but at the moment I am a start-up bootstrapping alongside my full time job.\n\nThe current team is as follows:\n\n**Rob – Founder**\n\n**https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-greig-2076b053/**\n\nRob is a serial entrepreneur, building businesses and developing software for 20 years in various industries. Highly skilled developer and Business Analyst. Previously built an estate agent monitoring system and an advanced automated backend/cloud API business that was sold to one of the largest UK estate agent portals (Fish4) and media company 'Trinity Mirror'.\n\nExcels in software planning, development, management along with building and mentoring small to medium development teams.\n\n**Ant - Founder**\n\nAnt is a serial entrepreneur, building businesses and testing software for 20 years in various industries. Fully Trained software tester previously worked for large high street companies (Maginus/Torex Retail/PC World/Matalan) testing their in-store user systems. Was part of the same company that built Agent Analyser and House Fusion later sold to 'Trinity Mirror'.\n\n**Dave – Lead Developer**\n\nDave is a highly experienced and loyal web and API developer that has worked for small and large companies and worked with the original Rockstar Games (Grand Theft Auto). Energetic and a team player who loves to explore new technology.\n\n**David – Developer**\n\nDavid is a youthful experienced and loyal web developer that has worked for small and large companies and is trained in Salesforce CRM development.\n\n**Callum – Social Media Marketing**\n\nCallum is a talented Photoshop and Video creator who has previously helped Luxury Car Showrooms build their Instagram followers from 0 to 300k in 3 months. With a keen eye for Photography and editing he is an asset to any team.\n\n**Future Positions**\n\nThere are plans for more developers, analysts, admin, sales and marketing employees if larger funds became available and the project gained traction.\n\n**Central Hub**\n\nAs a central hub for everything stake pool related, the library will have links and articles related to creating and running a stake pool along with other Cardano related articles and media such as podcasts, YouTube channels etc.\n\n**What will the Cardano Funds be used for?**\n\nI will use the Cardano funds to complete the development of the main website which will then enable the system to be presented to the stake pool operators to populate. The entries will then be verified before publishing. I envisage the site will be live within 6 months.\n\nThe website will be hosted on the scalable Microsoft Azure hosting platform allowing the performance to be easily upgraded in seconds if the site becomes popular. There are hosting costs associated with this which will also be taken from the funds.\n\nAnt and I will continue to bootstrap the project and will not take any wage for ourselves and contribute an additional £7,500 to the fund to go towards wages and other costs.\n\nHaving worked on the project plan in more detail I would require funding for 2-3 people for 6 months working out to be approximately 80,000 ADA.\n\nI am planning on staking 42k of ADA and hope the price would have appreciated in 6-9 months - this should lead to the project self-funding itself for a good length of time. If the funds run out I will continue to bootstrap the project and look for other ways to monetise the project.\n\n**Roadmap/Backlog**\n\n*M1 = milestone 1, M2 = milestone 2 etc.*\n\n*   Setup Microsoft Azure SQL Server, App Service and Website (M1)\n    \n*   Build main website\n    \n*   Technical Filters (M1)\n    \n*   Non –Technical Filters (M1)\n    \n*   About Us (M1)\n    \n*   How To, Registration etc. (M1)\n    \n*   External News Articles (M1)\n    \n*   In House News Articles (M2)\n    \n*   New Stake Pools Section (M1)\n    \n*   Other sections (M2 etc.)\n    \n*   General Cryptocurrency Information\n    \n*   Live Coin Prices (M1)\n    \n*   Price Converter (M1)\n    \n*   Price Chart (M1)\n    \n*   Gather Stake Pool Information (M1, M2 etc.)\n    \n*   Import Basic Cardano Information for Stake Pool (M1)\n    \n*   Build Stake Pool Information Questionnaire (M1)\n    \n*   Populate Stake Pool Database (M1, M2 etc.)\n    \n*   Contact Stake Pools (M1, M2 etc.)\n    \n*   Library Resources (M1, M2 etc.)\n    \n*   Build Stake Pool API (M1 v1.0)\n    \n*   Links to Cardano Community built podcasts, articles, videos, forums (M1, M2 etc.)\n    \n*   Investigate ways to integrate with other Cardano Community projects/websites (M1, M2 etc.)\n    \n\n**What does success look like from Fund2?**\n\n*   To have the main website built and accomplish Milestone 1 as outlined above.\n*   Initially whilst developing the website I would look to build the system with a small number of stake pools (sub 10) then contact and have the site enriched with 50 to 100 stake pools for launch. (note: all stake pools will be listed with basic information on launch)\n*   After launch I will begin on-boarding more and more stake pools and start to provide my own news content to the website.\n*   A great measure of initial success for \"go launch\" after 6 months would be\n\n*   5 or more 3rd party developers using the API\n*   10+ news articles\n*   50+ stake pools with enhanced information on the website\n*   500+ regular visitors per month\n*   Real-time Cryptocurrency tools\n\n*   Cardano information\n*   Other coin information\n\n*   Solid foundation to build upon\n*   2 Full time employees working on the website\n*   Recognised growing domain in the Cardano Community space\n\n**Future Funding and Enhancements**\n\nI will need to update the website with feedback from the initial trials and start to on board the remaining/new stake pools.\n\nAs the system will not be generating income I will investigate ways to monetise the platform whilst keeping the API and main information free for all. Advertising/promotions may be added somewhere but will not interfere with the goal to be a platform for all. I would imagine it may be possible to create promoted news articles.\n\nI would like to build a large social media following via YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc. as this has worked very well in growing previous brands my team and I have worked on.\n\nHighlighting the benefits the Stake Pools are giving back will be an important goal for the site. We will be building articles and showing the world the value added by the project externals contributors.\n\n**What value does Cardano Stake Pool Library bring to Cardano?**\n\nThe Cardano Stake Pool Library is aimed at building on top of existing Cardano stake pool infrastructure and offering a new way to discover and interact with Stake Pools. By having a single location that gives the Stake Pools a chance to show the founders personality, it will help bring a new angle to a growing audience of ADA stakers that are not only interested in the short term performance, but are interested in the macro view and share the same vision as the stake pool owners.\n\nIt is hoped stake pool owners will engage with the Cardano Stake Pool Library and find a new way to promote their \"brand\". The Cardano Stake Pool Library is aimed at both established high performing stake pools and new/slow performing ones. A voice for all.\n\nBy providing the API and other development resource this will allow 3rd party developers additional tools to build on top of Cardano. By showing how the eco-system is being actively developed this should encourage larger Cardano development adoptions.\n\n**IP/Copyright**\n\nAll IP and licensing of the website will remain vested with me. The outcome of this proposal will be a service for the community.\n\nThere will be lots of free tools and open source downloads to help grow the knowledge of the community.",

I am in the US and I want to send money to South Africa. I would send USD to a liquidity pool and recieve the equivalent in a stablecoin which is sent to the person in South Africa. That person can redeem the stablecoin for ZAR at current exchange rate using a ZAR liquidity pool. An incentive to build fiat liquidity would be to give rewards to people for placing fiat into the pools in their home countries buy giving them the ADA plus a reward fee. Could be very appealing since interest rates are so low. The entire process can be done from a single app that can then be used like the cash app or venmo where money can be used immediately from the app or sent to your bank account cheaply using the systems of that country that are already in place. The key to making this popular would be transparent fees, possibility for rewards for using the app, taking advantage of systems that are already in place ie the countries existing systems. Finally ease of use. Make it uncomplicated and strait forward for the working man to send money to his family abroad or even for businesses to easily pay international contractors without huge fees and complications.",

    "solutionDescription": "Lead a small team of sales professionals to pitch Cardano to potential developers, focusing on dev awareness and on-boarding.",
    "outcomeObjectives": null,
    "description": "**OVERVIEW**\n\nThe challenge for fund2 is clear. Encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build things. Let's keep it simple and do exactly that: reach out directly to developers that could quickly learn Plutus/Marlowe to explain what Cardano is and encourage them to become a part of the Cardano community. The more developers in our community, the easier it will be for entrepreneurs to build exciting things. This proposal is to build a small team of qualified individuals with a diverse set of expertise/experience to spend the next 6 months actively networking, cold calling, emailing, DMing, and figuring out any other way to reach developers where they are and make sure they are aware of the opportunities in the Cardano ecosystem and how they can get involved.\n\n  \n\n**TIMELINE**\n\n**Month 1**\n\n\\- **Team Building:** Using the catalyst fund community, twitter, discord, and telegram, establish a team of consultants (max of 5) with a diverse set of skills, knowledge, experience, and expertise in order to maximize potential networking opportunities/on-boarding efficacy. Ideally this will include at least one developer to be able to answer technical questions any of us might have when reaching out to Haskell and Solidity devs.  \n\\- **Developer Research:** Work with other developers and community members to build profile archetypes for perspective developers. Research what developers are seeking and how best to attract them.  \n\\- **Template Creation:** Build a sales template with a clear standard for 1. how to approach developers 2. how to present Cardano in a way that excites and encourages developers to get involved 3. where best to direct devs to learn more, work on a project, or get involved in the community.  \n\\- **Project Collaboration:** Work with other project catalyst proposers and implementers to create a short list of projects in need of developers and projects that offer more resources for new devs to learn Plutus/Marlowe.\n\n  \n\n**Month 2**\n\n\\- **Training:** assure all team members have a clear, basic understanding of Cardano, Haskell, and Solidity.  \n\\- **Sales Channel Research:** determine what the most effective platforms, groups, and organizations are for reaching devs.  \n\\- **Assign Responsibilities:** determine who will be responsible for working each channel, what the expectations are, and how many hours they will work\n\n  \n\n**Month 3-6**\n\n\\- **Acquire Developers:** each team member will be responsible for acquiring 1 new developer every two weeks. \"acquire\" means either 1. connecting them with an existing project. or 2. confirming they are learning the Plutus/Marlowe language.\n\n\\- **Measuring KPIs:** measuring which channels are performing best/worst and adjusting the team's efforts to focus on the most effective activities. Measuring who on the team is performing well and who isn't. If a team member does not acquire at least 1 new developer during a 3 week time period, they will be cut from our team and their remaining funding will go back to the catalyst fund.\n\n  \n\n**GOALS**  \n\\- **40** **New Developers:** 5 team members actively connecting with developers in creative and effective ways should yield at minimum 1 new dev/team member every 2 weeks. With a goal of 10 new developers acquired every month for the whole team.  \n\\- **5 Projects Staffed:** a portion of new developers acquired should go straight to working on projects that need help building something. Hopefully this number is much higher, but we will commit to connecting at least 5 developers with projects in need.\n\n  \n\n**EXPECTATIONS**  \nI am extremely excited about Cardano and I want to be a bigger part of building it. I think this is the best use of my skills and it will directly impact this funds challenge in a clear and measurable way. I currently work a full time job in sales but will be leaving my job at the end of November to focus purely on my entrepreneurial endeavors. I suspect most of the people involved in this team will also have other priorities as well, so I envision it being part time or about 10-15 hours a week for each team member. I am certain that we will be able to accomplish our goals set out in this proposal.\n\n**FUNDING**\n\nIdeally there would be some sort of commission system for compensating team members for acquiring new developers, but I am unsure how the logistics would work for such a system, so instead I am proposing a flat 100,000 ADA, split equally between all team members (max of 5)",

    "description": "Cardano needs to have tools available for the growing users and developers who are the building blocks of this new economy. We have built Cardanoscan to allow users to query each and every piece of the information on the Cardano blockchain which includes all types of certificates, withdrawals, reward balances, withdrawn reward balances, stake key history, pools, and all other connecting data pieces on the network.\n\n1\\. Cardanoscan has a custom-built core, thus providing data that is not available in the official explorer as well.\n\n2\\. Cardanoscan is the most useful explorer for users and also for the core Cardano developers.\n\n3\\.

Open-source software stack meets non-custodial algo-optimized lending pools, all powered on Cardano rails. At its core this is what Liqwid is.\n\nTo learn more please visit our website at: http://liqwid.finance/\n\n**++*What is the Total Addressable Market and who are the current players?*++**\n\n\"…Global digital lending platform market is growing with a CAGR of 18.9% in\n\nthe forecast period of 2019 to 2027 and expected to reach USD 16.9\n\nbillion by 2027. Increasing trend of digital banking is a driving factor for the\n\nmarket growth.\"\n\nCurrent instant loan solutions in traditional \"Centralized\" Finance (CeFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) currently charge rent-seeking fees with overhead cost related to bank kyc/aml further increasing cost (cost of money + fees) and reducing overall profitability of the lending network.\n\n***++Why Liqwid?++***\n\nLiqwid is the web3 open finance alternative poised to disrupt this entire model with the introduction of onchain credit, identity and as a result data monetization and ownership by Liqwid users. The growth incentives tied to the protocol's governance framework ensures early Liqwid users providing assets to help the protocol bootstrap not only become stakeholders with a governance voice they are subsidize for their cost incurred within the protocol with a governance token representing the rights to the future cashflows generated by Liqwid markets during loan origination and asset redemption. This is what radical open banking looks like.\n\nLiqwid enables developers building on Cardano to integrate streaming interest directly into their product or develop Layer 3 open apps that utilize Liqwid open-source API's (+ contract functions and SDK's) to unlock a web3-verse of open financial (+credit, data and insurance) applications. All powered on Cardano web3 rails.\n\nWeb3 open democracy > Web2 CeFi banks\n\n***++Liqwid 6 month development roadmap is live on our website++*** (and attached in the comment section below)\n\n***++Founding Team combined experience:++***\n\n• 4 years+ Management Consulting working on projects including: Financial Modeling,\n\nCapital Budgeting, Bank Lending/Reserve Analysis, Multi-Team largescale Enterprise Software Implementations\n\nImplementations, Data (Analysis, Modeling, Profiling)\n\n• 1 year+ Cardano Stake Pool Operator (Proof of Africa)\n\n• 5 years+ Digital Marketing and Project Management\n\n• Early Project Catalyst fund1 Community Advisors\n\n***++Learn more about Liqwid Protocol's core development and integration partners building Liqwid v1. on Plutus testnet:++***\n\n++*Tweag.io*++ : Tweag Haskell engineers built Cardano's smart contract language Plutus from the ground up working alongside IOHK's Plutus dev team for the past 3+ years. Some of the brightest smart contract minds at IOHK (Manuel Chakravarty) are Tweag personnel helping guide initially Plutus's architecture and design and now its implementation.\n\nAs a result of Tweag's work on Plutus with IOHK devs they have become defacto domain experts of Plutus as a platform. More specifically Tweag's blockchain engineers are uniquely experienced in the working mechanics of Plutus and well-positioned to step in and drive the Liqwid protocol architecture and design workshops leading up to development on the Plutus testnet.\n\nThe competitive advantage Tweag has over any other development firm (even exclusively Haskell) is clear; as the original protocol architects and designers of Cardano's smart contract platform no other development firm has this much Cardano smart contract experience and working knowledge (both tacit and explicit).\n\n*++Appinventiv.com++* : Appinventiv is a mobile apps development firm based in the U.S., India, and U.K.\n\nThey are consistently ranked as top developers by 1st class software development ranking platforms like Clutch (https://clutch.co/profile/appinventiv).\n\nAppinventiv has an entire group of dedicated blockchain dapp devs who build mobile dApps/integrations on top of existing DeFi protocols. We plan to leverage their vast experience and working knowledge on liquidity pool-based, interest-accruing protocols live on Ethereum today.\n\nNext our Integration partners:\n\n*++Credmark.com++* : Credmark builds onchain credit data generating products for retail, enterprise, and government users.\n\nCredmark Clear is their credit product built for retail consumers; Clear enables any developer to use Credmark's API's to build onchain credit data into a dApp/product.\n\nThe Credmark team is a current Emurgo dLab startup firm and our team founder's see strong synergies in integrating Clear into Liqwid Protocol.\n\nthe v1 of this integration for Liqwid v1 on Plutus testnet will be a simple data retrieval using Credmark's API's but we are planning to develop a more robust solution for credit data calculations that merges social credit lending principles with social media and develop this into a DeFi credit data tool purpose built for Liqwid's peer-to-peer lending pools.\n\nAfter completing an exhaustive 1.5 month round of meeting individual blockchain engineers and development firms we feel confident the development and integration team building Liqwid has the proven capabilities required to drive the successful final outcome of this proposal; Liqwid go-live on Plutus testnet in the next 5-6 months.\n\n***++Detailed development plan + documentation included in attachments 1-5.++***\n\n***++Requested Development Funds:++***\n\nHigh level costing for the entire platform development through MVP deployment (5-6 months).\n\n***++Going the agile way with Appinventiv blockchain DeFi development team:++***\n\nFor Liqwid's extensive application requirements, an agile approach with Appinventiv dedicated blockchain DeFi team as the core development partner working full time towards Liqwid's MVP deployment is the most efficient route to successful delivery on time and within budget.\n\nMonthly billing will occur based upon actual allocation of resources for each month. The overall work scope and development tasks completed over the period of time will follow the Agile-based SDLC method detailed in attachment 1 (slides 5-7).\n\n**++*Initial 4 weeks of Engagement*++**\n\nAs initial 4 weeks are quite crucial for the entire Liqwid MVP development, wherein we can define overall protocol architecture, project plan, wireframes and complete roadmap, the Appinventiv team will deploy a dedicated blockchain team (with DeFi Liquidity Pool development experience) including; a Project Manager, Blockchain Technical Lead, Lead Architect, DeFi Analyst and QA to work closely with the Liqwid core and Tweag teams.\n\n***++Cost++***: USD 20,000 for the first month; one of the most competitive rates on market (https://clutch.co/profile/appinventiv).\n\n***++Agile Development Sprints++***\n\nWhile working with this approach, we can ensure, we roll out first release within first 5 - 6 months as MVP and continue building on top of it towards mainnet go-live.\n\nOur core development partner is aligned on the Liqwid final form goal: a self-sustainable DeFi dApp generating transaction fee cashflows for all ADA stakeholders and open software devs are incentivized to utilize to build interest, data, and liquidity directly into their app.\n\n**++*Cost*++**: USD 25,000 - USD 26,000 each month depending upon actual hours allocation **++(months 2-6)++**.\n\n***++Tweag++***: Cardano smart contract experts that will drive the Liqwid Protocol audit and strategic design activities.\n\nObjectives:\n\n● Audit the development of Liqwid protocol\n\n● Upskill developers working in various aspects of the Liqwid protocol development\n\nEngagement model is iteration (sprint) based. The unit of engagement is 10 day iterations.\n\nRole: Blockchain Specialist\n\nUnit: 1 (for 1st sprint)\n\nDays: 10\n\nUnit Price: USD 800 per day\n\nTotal per iteration (excl. VAT): USD 16,000\n\nNote: For both development teams; monthly billing will occur based upon actual allocation of resources for each month.\n\n**++Data Science Team: (2)++** Liqwid has 2 new addition as we have data science devs who work on algo designing with Big Data have joined out team to help de-risk some of the algorithmic concepts/qCredit scoring model in our system. One of the devs is building a credit based DeFi protocol on ethereum and is based in Bangalore, India and the other dev runs a data science consultancy in Boston. In addition there are several credit risk scoring subject matter experts our team has discussed Liqwid concepts with and at some point in the near future we will bring one of them onboard to help scope and implement the v1 (qCredit score + validate Liqwid's set of system algorithms the protocol makes great use) product delivery you can see within our Medium blog posts above.\n\n\\*The Liqwid core development + founding Team you see in our proposal headline/UN hackathon submission are receiving USD 0 from the requested amount, all funds will go towards protocol development cost highlighted in the funding section above.\n\n***++Total Funds Requested for fund2++*** (~6 week runway): Appinventiv Core Dev Team ($20,000) + Tweag Plutus Specialist ($16,000) + (2) Data Science experts + strategic lead/advisor (~$2k per month) +Tax/Transaction costs ($500) = USD 38,500\n\nUSD 38,500 = 385,000 ADA (ADA ~ USD 0.10)\n\nOur team is requesting capital to fund the Appinventiv and Tweag teams budget requirements for the entire length of fund2.\n\nBoth development partners are fully aligned and committed to reaching our fund2 goals, on time and budget; complete the 1st 3 phases leading up to development (planning, analysis, design) and all of the activities/deliverables output from the tasks within each dev phase.\n\nI encourage you all to explore our Agile development methodology (slide 5) as well as the fund2 breakout (inputs, dev tasks, deliverables, outputs) in the 1st attachment (slide 6).",

We need builders and visionaries building great products on top of it!\n\nSome of the world's most brilliant minds in programming language design and computer science laid the foundations for this platform. Formally verifiable safety-first languages and tools assist in catching mistakes and vulnerabilities before they are deployed, giving our platform a deeper level of assurance for critical solutions while also providing a great developer experience.\n\nWe cannot ask for a better time to evangelise Cardano as the future decentralised financial operating system of the world. The existing blockchain platform of choice, Ethereum, is struggling with high fees, network congestion, broken smart contracts and a series of technical mishaps delaying the rollout of its much-needed upgrade.\n\n  \n\n**ROAD MAP**\n\nUsing YouTube as a main platform we will deliver 25 episodes in 6 months, with 1 episode per week\n\n**Making Sense of Cardano Series:** 10-30 minutes each.

We take pride in open-sourcing technical resources for our amazing community (e.g. https://github.com/SafeStak/pool-construction-kit) and have guided both SPOs and delegators towards understanding the technical fundamentals.\n\nIn the smart contracts space we have had exposure building smart contracts in Ethereum using Remix and Truffle.\n\nMuch of our knowledge for Cardano's rapidly evolving smart contracts platform had been developed through the following materials:\n\n*++The Udemy Courses++*\n\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/\n\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/marlowe-programming-language/\n\n++*Tutorials*++\n\nhttps://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/tutorial/index.html\n\nhttps://prod.playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/tutorial/\n\n++*Playgrounds*++\n\nhttps://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/\n\nhttps://prod.playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/\n\n  \n\n**LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nExpanding the Cardano ecosystem through education is our main goal and this constantly evolving space means our work is never done. As larger updates are rolled out (e.g. KEVM, IELE, etc.) we want our watchers be fully aware of breaking changes, newly established best-practices and killer features.\n\n  \n\n**RISK**\n\nThe Marlowe and Plutus languages with their associated APIs and environments are ever-evolving and we will try our best to ensure written tutorials and source code are up-to-date. However it is not a straightforward process to produce a new video with every update so a judgement call will determine if an updated video needs to be released upon a new release to the smart contracts platform.\n\n  \n\n**COSTS**\n\nStaff costs: Team of three cost for 6 month 7,500 USD\n\nEquipment/licensing costs 4,574 USD\n\nTotal: 12,074 USD (With Ada price at 0.10 => USD 120,740 ADA)\n\n  \n\n**MILESTONES**\n\nThe funds can be first for the equipment that we need and than monthly as we deliver our work\n\n  \n\n**IP**\n\nAll accompanying educational material (GitHub tutorial and code) is open-source under the MIT license\n\nVideo content will be under Creative Commons 2.0\n\n  \n\n**METRICS**\n\nNumber of views, geographic data, subscribers and how long are the people actually watching the videos\n\nIf you would like to talk more with us please go to https://discord.com/invite/tgcVvNx",

    "problemDescription": "Official cardano wallets are limited in the features and usefulness they provide. Our wallet will support plugins with functions people need",
    "solutionDescription": "To create a wallet with support for plug-ins developed and maintained by the community. Need a feature? Install a plug-in or create one.",
    "outcomeObjectives": null,
    "description": "**OVERVIEW**\n\nAs part of our e-commerce integration work (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Free-Commerce-sell-online-with-ADA/322288-48088) we started working on a wallet for cardano to work around some limitations on existing wallets (daedalus, yoroi).\n\n**VALUE PROPOSITION**\n\nTo cater for every conceivable user need when using crypto to interact with the external world.\n\n**Our goal**\n\nWe want to enable developers and third party service providers to build plug-ins that interact with your cardano wallet: transactions that can feed accounting systems, exchanges that could move funds into your wallet and stake them, and many other functions that no single crypto wallet currently has.\n\nTo enable this, we propose the creation of a plug-in oriented architecture for a wallet that allows any developer in the community to create their own functionalities into plugins that could be shared with all users of this wallet.\n\nHere is a video explaining the plug-in concept:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cUyfRMnhrAo?t=1571\n\n**Examples**\n\nHere are some of the functionalities that the community could create plug-ins for:\n\n*   tax calculation relevant to a particular jurisdiction.\n    \n*   adding support for other crypto currencies.\n    \n*   custom listing and display of stake pools, wallet balances, etc.\n    \n*   automation of tasks such as automatic redelegation, fund transfer, etc.\n    \n*   trading from inside the wallet (e.g. if price gets to a given target, or some trading indicator produces a signal, send 50% to binance and sell. Also buy from binance and transfer the ADA back to your wallet).\n    \n*   language translations for the wallet and its plugins.\n    \n*   running the wallet as a stake pool (yes it can be done)\n    \n*   alternative mechanisms to generate private keys for a wallet (i.e. no seed phrases).\n    \n\nAnd so much more. We want this to be THE wallet of choice for everyone.\n\n**WHY NOT DAPPS?**\n\nPlug-ins add user interface features and read information from the wallet and external service providers in order to implement a certain function. They can't be dApps but can certainly help the process to integrate dApps that could work straight from your wallet without you having to visit a single website.\n\nSome of the major differences are:\n\n*   *dApps require fees to be paid. Plug-ins don't* - with a plug-in you can generate a report from the transactions you already have on your local pc at no extra cost.\n    \n*   *dApps run on the blockchain. Plug-ins don't* - dApps cannot interact with third party providers such as Xero (for accounting), or an exchange (for trading). Also dApps can't generate an excel files or other such documents for you.\n    \n*   *dApps don't have access to your local computer and its resources. Plug-ins do* - a plug-in can lock your desktop wallet after 2 minutes without being used, open and create local files, access your printer, and execute all sorts of operations you might need.\n    \n\nIn short, plug-ins allow the wallet to support multiple functionalities that won't be available through dApps. They can enable an easy gateway between the traditional systems - financial or otherwise - and your crypto.\n\n**ACTIVITY BREAKDOWN**\n\nThe core wallet will be built anyway to interact with the cardano-wallet back-end (developed by IOG) and to support volume transactions for e-commerce operations (as detailed on our other project: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Free-Commerce-sell-online-with-ADA/322288-48088) and work as a regular wallet such as daedalus.\n\nFor ++*this project*++, we are looking to fund the work required to add support for ++*plugins*++:\n\n1.  Build and document the interfaces required by a plugin - that's essentially a common standard \"contract\" that all plugins have to follow to be loaded by the wallet\n2.  Support some form of automatic plugin update mechanism\n3.  Create a few plug-ins that will come with the wallet by default and can be used as an example or starting point for other developers, namely:\n\n*   a plugin to associate transactions in the wallet with online purchases\n*   a basic address manager (associate people's names with payment addresses)\n*   an export function with transaction details, inlcuding, stake rewards breakdown\n*   a stake pool listing with filters similar to what pooltool.io does (with sorting by given metrics)\n*   automatic currency conversion\n\nAlso please submit your input with ideas for plugin-ins and things you'd like to see in the wallet by default. I'll adjust the funding requested depending on what you'd like to see (or not) as part of this first round.\n\n**EXPECTATIONS**\n\nThis project will be my full time job for the foreseeable future\n\nYou can check our progress on the github repositories linked above.\n\nI'll also submit video updates every time any relevant development is complete.\n\n**MILESTONES**\n\n(Month 1) - Have a working wallet with the basic features existing wallets have: creating/restoring wallets, view and receive payments, list and delegate to stake pools\n\n(Month 2) - Define the plug-in interfaces and mechanisms to load these extensions in the wallet. Refactor wallet to have its capabilities (transaction listing, payments, wallet restoration, etc) running as plug-ins themselves. Document how to write and deploy wallet extensions\n\n(Month 3) - Release candidate of the ENVLP wallet with plugin-in capabilities.\n\n(Month 4) - Introduce plug-in update features, to allow easy, automated detection of new versions of plug-ins released by the community\n\n(Month 5 onward) - Release final version, work on bug fixing, enhancements and general software maintenance as required.\n\n**IP/Copyright**\n\nThe entire source code of this project will be available on github under the Apache V2.0 license.\n\n**FUTURE PLANS**\n\nOnce plug-in support is available we expect that developers in the community begin creating their plug-ins and share them independently of our input. The idea is that the wallet becomes an ecosystem of its own, where new features are not dependent on wallet updates.\n\n**RISK**\n\nI'm counting on earning additional funding from fees collected by the SHOP stake pool, especially to keep the project going after the first year.\n\nI'm trying to minimize risk by already coding an initial prototype version that interacts with the cardano-wallet back-end\n\nOurselves or independent plug-in developers are not responsible for potential financial loss caused by bugs on the software.\n\nPlug-ins could be created with malicious intent. As none of the software will have an \"owner\", the community will be responsible for vetting and informing other users about any fraudulent activity.\n\nSoftware development with bleeding edge technology can come with surprises that usually take a long time to overcome. The work to interact with the cardano-wallet backend is ongoing and the difficulty in implementing some feature - such as delegation for example - may prove to be much more time consuming than anticipated.\n\n**METRICS**\n\nCode activity can be measured from the commits on the following github project:\n\nhttps://github.com/uniVocity/free-commerce\n\nIt can already be compiled and deployed by anyone interested in seeing how the software is working at any point during development. We will provide step by step documentation on how to build, run and test everything independently.\n\n**ACTIVITY BREAKDOWN AND EXPECTED COST:**\n\n*Assuming hourly rate of 50 USD/hour*\n\n*Optimistic estimates*\n\n**\\- Development activities:**\n\n(A) Determine plug-in interfaces (3 to 5 days): classes and methods developers must implement in their plug-ins to enable their extensions to be recongnized and loaded into the wallet.\n\n(B) Implementation or plug-in loading (21 to 28 days): load/unload plugins, display extension elements in the user interface (menus, context pop-up menus, dialogs, etc), integrate with local database and processes, allow plug-ins to start/stop their own secondary processes if they need (such cardano-graph-ql for example, and even microsoft access).\n\n(C) Provide a localization framework (5 to 7 days): required to allow all plug-ins and the wallet itself to be translated according to any regional language and currency/date formats. Localization can be provided independently by the community so the plug-in developers won't have to worry about translating their extensions themselves.\n\n(D) Implement plug-in publishing, rating and self-updating capabilities (14 to 21 days): provide plug-in repositories which allows users to search, download, upgrade and rate plugin-ins.\n\n(E) Documentation and tutorials (3 to 4 days): document source code and publish tutorials on how to create plug-ins. This is documentation for other developers to refer to when trying to understand the software and write code for it to build plug-ins. For examples of documentation we've already written for other software, refer to these:\n\n*   *source code documentation:* http://docs.univocity.com/parser/html/2.2.0/com/univocity/api/entity/html/builders/ElementFilterStart.html\n*   *step by step tutorial:* https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-trader\n\n(F) Implementation default plugins (5 to 8 days): these will come pre-installed with the wallet and can be used as examples for developers. These functionalities will be refactored out of the initial wallet version built for our e-commerce integration work (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Free-Commerce-sell-online-with-ADA/322288-48088) which won't come with support for plug-ins initially.\n\nEstimates account for testing and development releases.\n\n++DEVELOPMENT TOTALS:++\n\n\\* min: 3+21+5+14+3+5 = 51 days \\* 8 hours/day = 408 hours \\* 50 USD/hour = 20400 USD one-off\n\n\\* max: 5+28+7+21+4+8 = 73 days \\* 8 hours/day = 584 hours \\* 50 USD/hour = 29200 USD one-off\n\n**\\- Support activities (around 15 to 20 hours per month):**\n\n(A) bug fixing and feature requests\n\n(B) provide assistance for developers who want to buid their own plug-ins\n\n(C) plugn-in repository server monitoring and maintenance\n\n++SUPPORT TOTALS:++\n\n\\* min: 15 hours \\* 3 months = 45 hours \\* 50 USD/hour = 2250 USD\n\n\\* max: 20 hours \\* 3 months = 60 hours \\* 50 USD/hour = 3000 USD\n\n**\\- Running costs:**\n\n\\* One server to act as a plug-in repository developers can use to plublish their plug-ins, and users can search and download them from (80 USD/month)\n\nRunning costs may vary depending on demand, but we don't expect it to be extremely active.\n\n++SERVER TOTALS:++\n\n\\* 80 USD/month \\* 12 months = 960 USD/year\n\n**++PROJECT TOTALS++ (first year, assuming 1 ADA = 0.08 USD):**\n\n\\* min: 20400 + 2250 + 960 = 23610 USD = 295125 ADA\n\n\\* max: 29200 + 3000 + 960 = 33160 USD = 414500 ADA\n\nMeet in the middle project price: (295125 + 414500) / 2 = **354812 ADA**\n\n**Thank you for your support!**",

    "description": "**OVERVIEW**\n\nWe want to build integrations to enable cardano payments in ALL major e-commerce platforms but for this round we will focus on Shopify for our first step in the journey towards adoption.\n\nSo initially, we are going to release and maintain an official Shopify app, which will be immediately accessible to more than 500,000 online businesses around the world who generate 800 million dollars per minute in sales. This work has already started the source code is available on github: https://github.com/uniVocity/shopify\n\n**VALUE PROPOSITION**\n\nTo enable the cardano blockchain to work as a free payment gateway and facilitate e-commerce by eliminating intermediaries between product/service providers and consumers.\n\n**How it will work**\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of how it will work: first it will be free for everyone. Other than regular transaction fees on the blockchain itself, no one has to pay commissions nor fees. There's no account creation required anywhere and it works as a straight \"wallet to wallet\" solution:\n\n1.  The shopify app doesn't have anyone's private key (from neither the shop who installs the app nor the customers).\n2.  At no point the app server should have access to anyone's funds, even if temporarily.\n3.  To enable ada payments, the shop will provide its public root key. Not the private key.\n\n*   That root key will be used to generate new receiving addresses on demand.\n*   Every receiving address will be unique. We generate shelley receiving addresses like what daedalus gives out.\n\n1.  When a customer of a store makes a purchase, a new receiving address will be generated from the public root key and associated with the order.\n2.  When someone sends ADA to a payment address, the store owner will receive the ADA directly in their wallet, to which we have no access (we don't know and don't want to know the private key)\n3.  Once the total amount of the order is paid to the receiving address, the order is fulfilled and the shop can send the items purchased to the customer .\n4.  With one receiving address per order we are able to determine that X amount was sent to that particular receiving address, instead of mixing funds with the whole balance of the wallet managed by the store.\n\n*   This also maintains privacy of the online store as one customer won't be able to see other payments the store received.\n\n  \n\nIn short, our solution works as a mere observer of transactions made from one or more (customer) addresses to another from the store owner (associated with an online purchase). Funds go straight to the shop owner wallet.\n\n**What we already did**\n\nHere is a video update on the developments already made to process online payments using cardano on Shopify:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UFeGmEiZKfA\n\n**Challenges found**\n\nDuring initial development of this we found a few limitations on existing wallets that can hinder larger businesses to process high volumes of sales using the blockchain. So part of the Shopify integration work also depends on an e-commerce friendly wallet for cardano which we are building.\n\nThis is a desktop wallet to help online stores process payments and is not specific to Shopify. It's being built to make it easy for businesses to generate and upload public root keys (required to generate payment addresses on demand) to their online stores.\n\nThe wallet will be able to pull online purchase information associated with every payment received, and will work around limitations of existing wallets that aren't suited for handling payments at scale - the BIP-44 protocol generates payment address in sequence, and expects at least one transaction every 20 payment addresses. If a website has 20 abandoned checkouts and receives a payment on the 21st checkout, the payment won't show up in your regular wallet (daedalus, yoroi, etc) - the money is not lost, but it's not accounted for until there is at least on transaction every 20 addresses generated. Our wallet aims to solve this issue and make sure high volumes of sales can be processed without any hiccups.\n\nThe wallet work, along with more detailed information, is also open-source and available here: https://github.com/uniVocity/free-commerce\n\nHere is another video detailing why and how it will work:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cUyfRMnhrAo\n\n  \n\n**EXPECTATIONS**\n\nThis project will be my full time job for the foreseeable future\n\nYou can check our progress on the github repositories linked above.\n\nI'll also submit video updates every time any relevant development is complete.\n\nA store owner should be able to run their own free-commerce server independently of me or anyone else.\n\n**MILESTONES**\n\n*(Month 1)* - The ENVLP wallet must be released before anything else as it is what will enable online stores to export public root keys to generate payment addresses for them, and once payments are received, it will display them correctly (as explained earlier regular wallets such as daedalus are unable to display payments where there are \"gaps\" of more than 20 payment addresses with no transactions)\n\n*(Month 2)* - A development version of the integration with the basic sales workflow will be released for online stores who want to test it. It will be updated frequently to incorporate adjustments and more features.\n\n*(Month 3)* - Better integration of the ENVLP wallet with the online store (reports, online store management, etc)\n\n*(Month 4)* - Release candidate of the shopify APP.\n\n*(Month 5)* - Free-commerce app available on the shopify app store for all 500K stores that run on that platform.\n\n*(Month 6 onward)* - maintenance, monitoring and adjustments as required.\n\n**IP/Copyright**\n\nThe entire source code of this project will be available on github under the Apache V2.0 license.\n\n**FUTURE PLANS**\n\nEverything we are doing here is planned to allow for easy introduction of new capabilities. A lot of the work for our Shopify integration will be reused to enable online payments in other platforms - to which we will submit proposals in the future.\n\n**RISK**\n\n*   I'm counting on earning additional funding from fees collected by the SHOP stake pool, especially to keep the project going after the first year.\n*   I've tried to minimize risk by already coding an initial prototype version the proves the integration will work with Shopify.\n*   Store owners who intend to use this integration must be aware of their local legislation regarding the usage of crypto for the exchange of goods.\n*   Consumers of stores who sell goods for ADA must be aware of the risks associated with transacting with crypto currencies - there is little to no recourse in case of fraud. Transactions can't be reversed and funds can't be seized. This can be minimized if consumers purchase from reputable stores.\n*   Software development with bleeding edge technology can come with surprises that usually take a long time to overcome. I already spent a whole week to identify and solve the issue of payments not showing on daedalus - related to the 20 payment address gap mentioned above - which prompted me to begin working on the ENVLP wallet to overcome this limitation. That added at least one extra month of development time, not counting the work already done so far. I hope it will be smooth sailing from here but we can never know.\n\n**METRICS**\n\nCode activity can be measured from the commits on these two github projects:\n\n*   https://github.com/uniVocity/free-commerce\n*   https://github.com/uniVocity/shopify\n\nThe projects can be compiled and deployed by anyone interested in seeing how the software is working at any point during development. We will provide step by step documentation on how to build, run and test everything independently.\n\nOnce the free-commerce app is available to online stores on shopify, we can obtain reports and feedback from businesses that are using the integration.\n\n**ACTIVITY BREAKDOWN AND EXPECTED COST:**\n\n*\\*Assuming hourly rate of 50 USD/hour (low ball)*\n\n*\\*Optimistic estimates*\n\n**\\- Development activities:**\n\n(A) Sales database setup (7 to 10 days): allow registering order, product and customer information from multiple stores which can run on multiple platforms. We want to reuse the same back-end to process sales from not only shopify - there's magento, woocommerce, etc.\n\n(B) Back-end integration with shopify (14 to 21 days): install/uninstall app, process webhooks which shopify uses to send updates to our servers, implementation of functions for interacting with the online store and its data (mark orders as paid, manual/phone orders).\n\n(C) Back-end processing (30 to 45 days): e-mail sending, QR code generation, tracking of pending orders and corresponding payment addresses, conversion of dollar amount to ADA (from multiple sources), handling expiration of orders that are not paid within a given timeframe, process discounts, handling partial payments and overpayments\n\n(D) Back-end integration with cardano-db-sync (2-3 days): create database triggers and other functions to broadcast updates in real time from the blockchain to (C) and capture payments to addresses associated with open orders created by each store.\n\n(E) Front-end integration with shopify (14-21 days): create app admin pages to configure essentials such as public root key upload (used to generate payment addresses for each order created by customers of the store), e-mail servers, e-mail templates, configuration of disounts for one or more products and their variants, allow store owner to determine price of goods in ADA (fixed) or fiat, basic reporting capabilities.\n\n(F) ENVLP wallet development (30 to 45 days): upload public root keys to online store from within the wallet. Pull order/customer/product information fom the online store associated with each transaction in the owner wallet. Implement support for staking, sending and receiving money like a regular wallet (i.e. interact with the cardano-wallet service)\n\n(G) Build/deployment (3 to 4 days): produce scripts that produce self-contained packages ready for deployment to the servers who will run this integration (also making it easier for others to deploy and run this in their own servers)\n\n(H) Documentation (4 to 7 days): document the source code and write tutorials with the steps required for others to extend, build and deploy this solution independently.

The Pyne Fund utilizes Cardano stake pools to provide funding to great projects through stake pool delegation, proclaiming the benefits of Cardano to those unfamiliar with blockchain, while providing a much needed alternative to funding.\n\n  \n\n\\--- The Pyne Fund Mission\n\n  \n\nIf individuals were able to donate to charities and causes they care about or invest in companies they wanted to see succeed, by merely moving money into a \"savings account\" they own, instead of giving it over to others with no guarantees of any return, would they?\n\nWe think so; and believe that it's possible thanks to Cardano and Cardano's stake pool ecosystem.\n\nThe Pyne Fund is a variant on a regular Cardano stakepool. A Pyne stakepool is created and operated by Pyne. The explicit purpose of the stake pool is not only to compete with other pools to complete blocks and generate rewards, but rather to use the majority of rewards to fund a number of charities, nonprofits, \"social good\" projects and eventually real companies/startup ideas.\n\nWhat does The Pyne Fund hope to achieve?\n\n1) Expand the Cardano ecosystem by bringing fund participants (beneficiaries and donors/funders) into the Cardano ecosystem in a simple to understand, familiar way\n\n2) Generate real-world interest and optimism around new ways of funding projects on-chain while proving Cardano is best positioned for this.\n\n3) Encourage a higher level of engagement by entrepreneurs and developers who can leverage what Pyne offers to fund their initiatives.\n\n  \n\n\\--- Creating the first Pyne Fund\n\n  \n\nThe first Pyne Fund stake pool will act as a proof of concept, not only to demonstrate our ability to implement and operate high quality stake pools, but also to measure the level of interest in the community in contributing some of their stake rewards to nonprofit/charitable organisations or business start-ups.\n\nThe first Pyne Fund will be centered around \"Sensemaking\" and the recipients will be distributed equally to:\n\nhttps://rebelwisdom.co.uk/ - Rebel Wisdom curated video content, online courses and communities and in-person events centered around moving beyond ideology to create honest discussions.\n\nhttps://www.humanetech.com/ - Center for Humane Technology is dedicated to creating the conditions for radically reimagined 21st century digital infrastructure.\n\nhttps://www.lesswrong.com/ - LessWrong is a place to develop and train rationality, and apply one's rationality to real-world problems. LessWrong serves these purposes with its library of rationality writings, community discussion forum, open questions research platform, and community page for in-person events.\n\nhttp://civilizationemerging.com/ - The Consilience Project, by Daniel Schmachtenberger, is a non-profit, transpartisan media organization going behind and beyond the news to help people make sense of their world. Read more…\n\nThe Pyne Fund will work closely with each recipient's stakeholders to guide them in offering their funders and donors this new way to contribute to their causes via stakepool delegation through The Pyne Fund.\n\nThe Pyne Fund will also provide the service of ongoing monthly updates to the community at large on how funds are being distributed and the real-world impact those funds have (since most recipients will not keep all transaction on-chain) and in future phases, a community forum for delegators to voice their opinions and vote on some issues will be included.\n\n  \n\n\\--- What do we think success looks like?\n\n  \n\nOur aim is to generate real funding from stake pool rewards for the first Pyne Fund recipient/s from our first pool, and we hope to generate 250,000 ADA in the form of stake pool rewards over a 3 month period. We believe this is possible by attracting a modest 50 million in delegated stake, achieving a 3.5% RoS and committing 85% of the rewards to The Pyne Fund recipients. To demonstrate long term viability, The Pyne Fund will be generating revenue through a fee equal to 10% of the recipients total rewards share each epoch.\n\nOff the back of this proof of concept (either once complete or if it is demonstrating success beforehand), The Pyne Fund will promote and engage potential future participants and build more capabilities to support fund recipients, such as:\n\n1) Additional managed services (e.g. marketing, business administration)\n\n2) Donor/New ADA stakers support (e.g. fiat to ADA conversions, ADA security)\n\n3) Incentive programs (e.g. start-up token rewards)\n\n  \n\n\\--- PYNE Stake Pool Examples\n\n  \n\nIn the example Pyne Fund stake pools created for sample projects/causes below, you can see two different potential scenarios, as the Cardano Education Program has a higher margin and lower delegator return, since it directly benefits and grows the ecosystem. The \"off-chain\" Micro-lending Charity is adjusted to give delegators a better incentive while still providing the fundraiser with much needed funding.\n\n  \n\nCardano Education Program\n\nTotal stake - ₳68mm\n\nPool performance - 95%\n\nOperator margin - 85%\n\nMonthly payout to recipient - ₳223,900\n\nMonthly PYNE fee - ₳24,880\n\nAnnual delegator RoS - 1.6%\n\n  \n\nMicro-lending Charity\n\nTotal stake - ₳30mm\n\nPool performance - 95%\n\nOperator margin - 50%\n\nMonthly payout to recipient - ₳56,900\n\nMonthly PYNE fee - ₳6,300\n\nAnnual delegator RoS - 3.2%\n\n  \n\n\\*In both examples, k=150, a0=0.3, Treasury Rate=20%, Expansion Rate=0.3%\n\n  \n\n\\--- A Proven Model\n\n  \n\nIndividuals and organizations across the globe are increasingly looking to blockchain solutions for charitable giving and ways to fund \"social good\" projects with more flexibility and transparency.\n\nThe Pineapple Fund was a philanthropic project by an anonymous individual which gave away 5,057 bitcoins to 60 charities.

    "description": "This proposal is motivated by Charles Hoskinson's recent call for action to create a set of specialized podcasts to increase awareness for Cardano.\n\n**The detailed project proposal can be found in the attached pdf file**.\n\n  \n\n**1\\. Problem:**\n\nCardano's blockchain technology represents a paradigm shift in the way we (humans) organize ourselves to earn, spend, invest, and save. Despite its enormous potential, this technology is faced with significant mental barriers in the mainstream business/finance consciousness due to lack of awareness of that very potential.\n\nBusiness and finance professionals control a large amount of developer and financial resources. They have a tainted view of the blockchain space and do not understand its potential enough to commit time and resources to build on top of it.\n\nThis is partly due to the poor quality of media in crypto sphere. Those who take a cursory look at the state of crypto media sees it as immature and too disconnected from the challenges and opportunities of the real world.\n\nThis invariably affects Cardano as one of the players in the space and hinders the rate of its adoption. Slot Leader aims to change that.\n\n**2\\. Solution:**\n\nThe purpose of Slot Leader is to elevate the quality of discourse around the blockchain technology and close the educational gaps between the traditional finance and blockchain. At the center of that discourse will be Cardano—a platform with the scientific foundation, built to augment and eventually replace the financial infrastructure for the world.\n\nWe intend to achieve our goals by creating high-quality video/audio content filled with meaningful discussions with prominent members of the crypto and finance communities about the potential of Cardano's technology and its applications in various sectors of economy.\n\nThe success of the show depends on the number and the quality of viewers we can reach and bring into Cardano's ecosystem from outside the world of crypto. That in turn depends on the depth of discussions, its mental framework, and the caliber of the guests.\n\nI am connected to three global networks of executives and finance professionals. Through my networks which include the INSEAD MBA program, World Bank/EBRD and Chartered Financial Analysts, I plan to reach a wider global audience of sophisticated viewers/listeners. These are executives who are constantly looking for insights to grow their businesses and have the capacity to commit capital and resources to build on Cardano.\n\n**3\\. Episode Format:**\n\n• Production: 1 per week\n\n• Length: 45-60min, pre-recorded for now and broadcasted live once we get enough viewership.\n\n• Content Structure:\n\n*   News/Events\n*   Market Pulse: Market Analysis\n*   Deep-Dive: An In-depth interview with a guest from crypto or traditional business/finance sectors.\n\n• Distribution: YouTube Video+ All the major podcast/audio channels\n\n**4\\. Host:**\n\nUmed Saidov, CFA is a seasoned investment professional with more than a decade of international banking experience and an extensive network of business and finance professionals. He has been part of the Cardano community since 2017 and produced numerous analytical articles about Cardano. He has appeared on the Cardano Effect multiple times and is a known stake pool operator in the community. Umed has an MBA from INSEAD a top-tier business school.\n\n  \n\nThe detailed proposal pdf file with KPIs is attached below.",

without needing to understand the technical underpinnings, doing so thanks to the new social graph and trust network established by preceding incentivised early adopters. a near future where \"***there's a Dapp for that***\"… 🤔\n\nnow imagine, in a nearer timeframe, where we early adopters having a two-way high-bandwidth low-latency broad reaching bilateral communication environment. an environment where these who are new to the space, having stumbled upon it on one of the many live streaming platforms, would start with live lessons of basics from concept breakdowns to wallet and or stake-pool setup. also where those already existing in the space would get a focused trustworthy source for the latest news contextualised, allowing for gradual organic establishment of domain experts within the community as well as debating advanced issues social or technical in governance, stake pool/delegator relations - but to name a few.\n\nthis is gradually being developed through segment collaborations with community members working on content from educational to finance. aware of the potential complimentary symbiotic relationship, recognising the opportunity for distribution to a focused captive audience and optimisation of their content creation. starting with fast turnaround covering of the latest happenings in crypto, with an eye to doing it differently, ultimately become a daily one stop shop for those wanting to be updated from a source they can rely on providing peace of mind 😌.\n\nthe community would also - via their mail/calender subscription - receive timely notification of educational segments as well as surprise guests segments.\n\n\\-\n\n**Challenge**: 🐣\n\nthe fundamental belief here is that in order for us to encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months, the chicken or egg problem needs to be solved. there's no business without a customer, no seller without a buyer, no chicken without the egg. so with that in mind, pre Voltaire/Goguen coming online and stabilising relatively, it'd be difficult and perhaps counterproductive to have a broad push for Dapps - instead amassing an audience makes more sense. get audience, then the rest follows.\n\n\\- - -\n\n**Impact**: 💥\n\n*   \\- effectively address the challenge, pre-Voltaire/Goguen online, high bandwidth low latency bilateral information flow, based on existing value (pre-Voltaire/Goguen) like delegation with higher rewards than banks, this will then garner a broader audience creating social proof/value signal for programmers/entrepreneurs\n    \n*   \\- focus on audience, technology Voltaire/Goguen will take atleast 6 months to come online and stablise - so tech (Dapp) implementation will be done then.\n    \n*   \\- not a personality or channel youtube/podcast (compromised integrity Ad-supported and platform censorship) or podcast (inefficient user experience and monetisation) solves for these fundamental flaws of existing standard.\n    \n*   \\- provenance, not through third parties - direct relationship, email/calendar (then DiD + pub sub after mvp)\n    \n*   \\- better communicators of the community\n    \n*   \\- aligned incentives, empowering community against the leveraged power dynamics (stakepools v delegators etc) stake pool operators would be, by means of needing to reach delegators, funding the development for the betterment of the platform for the community\n    \n*   \\- onboarding network effects (Metcalfe's law into Reed's law compounding) loop - monopoly: virtuous loop nfx post-interopability established trust reputation network\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\\- - -\n\n  \n\n**Feasibility**: 📝\n\nthe proposals time constrained nature, de-risked/mitigated mvp, along with the 6 months breakdown plan coupled with my given experience/skillset, I believe that'll provide sufficiently high enough assurance that the likelihood the proposal will be implemented.\n\n  \n\n\\- - -\n\n  \n\n**Auditability**: 🌡\n\n\\- I believe we'll be able to provide sufficient info to assess effective challenge address by cohort end (march 2021).\n\n\\- metrics/kpi - followers/subscribers v mail/calender subscribers 1k, retention, concurrent viewers, geo data to influence scheduling and internationalisation.\n\n\\- have created catalyst insight and feedback segment/series\n\n\\- programming stability/feedback achieved for 24hr loop.\n\n\\- spec for optimised web app with app web3 bridge / + DiD?\n\n\\- weekly community update/Q&A video\n\n\\- - -\n\n**Deliverables** 📦\n\nCAST has no \"end\" so to speak, its a 24 hour stream 7 days a week, 365 days a year - it's open ended. so deliverables are primarily illustrated in the auditability section above measured within the cohort.\n\n  \n\nSo to summarise, the intention is to aspire to have at least moderately 1,000 subscribers to the calender (people are territorial of their inboxes, so this is actually quite a tall order considering that these first few months are going to be really rough drafts - akin to the rehearsal phase during the development of a play.\n\n  \n\nTo have a construct/skeleton for content and creation - collaborator framework with sentiment analysis and direct feedback to inform design improvements.\n\n  \n\nLastly, have the web app ready for web3 functionality integration. (centralised streaming services/platforms to propogate the stream initially with private redundacy, part of web3 intergration would be exploring peer to peer)\n\n  \n\n\\---\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**Risks**: 🧐\n\nSWOT risks analysis + mitigation\n\n  \n\n**Strengths**: 💪🏾\n\n*   \\- MVP can be cobled together with exising services\n    \n*   \\- designing in the open + open sourcing + creative commons (nc)\n    \n*   \\- provenance, owning customer relationship not through their parties - direct relationship, email/calendar then pub sub\n    \n*   \\- positive habit forming w/ low barriers to interaction, daily trigger with a streamlined action, leading to evolving utility reward with continued time\n    \n*   \\- single+multiplayer, evolving levels/goals\n    \n*   \\- metrics, analytics insight\n    \n*   \\- content creation optimisation, through apps like Descript and shooting ratio/shooting for the edit (*see attached image 'shooting_ratio.png'*)\n    \n*   \\- self investment, obsession/perfectionism (iteration loop)\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\\- - -\n\n**Weaknesses**: 🥺\n\n*   \\- expectation management\n    \n*   \\- yet to acquire the two people needed to advance past mvp\n    \n*   \\- covid post viral fatigue\n    \n*   \\- obsession/perfectionism (mitigate: iterate frequently )\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\\- - -\n\n  \n\n**Opportunities**: 🔭\n\n*   \\- pandemic, working from home\n    \n*   \\- ride the decentralised technology wave\n    \n*   \\- affordable resources time/cost of mvp\n    \n*   \\- community-centric monopoly - (nfx, brand, tech, early mover)\n    \n*   \\- habit forming possibility, stickiness\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\\- - -\n\n  \n\n**Threats**: 🏴‍☠️\n\n*   \\- poor technical execution\n    \n*   \\- legislative unceratinty\n    \n*   \\- macro economic volatility - crypto/fiat, employment\n    \n*   \\- political uncertainty headwind\n    \n*   \\- technical (hardware/software) failure\n    \n*   \\- execution risks\n    \n*   \\- pandemic\n    \n*   \\- scam brand/content misappropriation\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\\- - -\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**Property**: ✍🏾\n\ncontent created will be released under Creative Commons NonCommercial (this is in an attempt to mitigate scam brand/content misappropriation - subject to change)\n\nopen source code for the font and back end of the web app and eventual web3 functionality.\n\n\\- - -\n\n  \n\n**Roadmap**: 🧭\n\nbudget of ~£15k (₳ ~ 200,000) @£0.08\n\n  \n\n£192,432 ($250,000)\n\n2,526,480.42\n\n20% = 505,296\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xny1W7HhHANLNeQcnbr8El5rakJ80VIM7fgDwJ-uqys/edit#gid=0\n\n  \n\n₳ 2,021,184 (100% = budget allocated towards proposals)\n\n₳ 200,000 (£15k) = 9.90% (of the budget allocated towards proposals)\n\n  \n\nbroken down into sections: fixed/variable costs, equipment, services and labour.\n\nsee link for spreadsheet: (work in progress)\n\n(https://www.icloud.com/numbers/0JjTGA3ZjbMrrOyS_SOwPdFsA#CAST_mvp)\n\n\\-\n\nGantt chart coming at some point.\n\npeak at few graphics (https://www.figma.com/file/Rpdrxnnr7lrH8VV5k9rxIt/CAST_public?node-id=0%3A1)\n\n\\- - -\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**facetime**: 🤙🏾👀\n\ncomments on here (ideascale) at the moment aren't the best way to understand or get clarity, so just reach out to me on discord (https://discord.gg/neyNPG9) as I'm quite open and keen to taking questions one on one - I'll then iterate the proposal on here based on these conversations. 🙇🏾‍♂️\n\ndiscord link: (https://discord.gg/neyNPG9)\n\n  \n\nschema:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tWaA0XRhbcM\n\n  \n\ndifferences:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DViU9NJ4wuA\n\n  \n\nProgramme:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_t1WoogEi6w\n\n  \n\nFundraising:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLV3lz7P7-ISiveoIez4Vt-GXc6wWB05N",

    "description": "\\[NOTE: For a more detailed submission (with graphics) please refer to the attached pdf file.\\]\n\n**Thesis**\n\nCompetition based on costs and fees, if taken to its logical end, will ultimately push the entire ecosystem into a handful of operators running the entire network on a handful of locations offering competitive rates. To combat this eventuality, we need to let SPOs have avenues to offer differentiated services to their stakeholders.\n\nOur goal is to make Cardano an economically vibrant ecosystem, fully capable of supporting SPOs as small businesses. We plan to achieve this by creating a safe platform for SPOs and stakeholders to interact and provide their value-added services.\n\nThe Cardano community has a diverse group of SPOs with varying talents, which could be tapped into by the act of staking with pools that offer those talents. This additional layer of services will keep Cardano's playing field fair and diversified both geographically and technically, as it removes the need for SPOs to compete on cost and fees alone.\n\nFunding PoolTool is a win-win-win solution for the entire Cardano ecosystem as enables:\n\n*   SPOs build economically sustainable businesses on top of Cardano.This could be any range of product or services from research to dApps.\n*   Pools to create pool consortiums, which would allow their respective stakeholders access a basket of goods/services offered by the members of these consortiums. This idea is much like what we see with airline miles in the real-world businesses.\n*   Delegators to support pools and projects they care most about directly.\n*   Cardano ecosystem tap into additional sources of funding organically and reduce the need for treasury funds.\n\n**How Would It Work?**\n\nCurrently, the Cardano ecosystem works in a one-way direction. Stakeholders have plenty of avenues to evaluate, select and interact with SPOs. There is plenty of information about stake pools, but stake pool operators have close to zero visibility about their delegators beyond the addresses and amounts.\n\nThe existing avenues to interact with stakeholders are fragmented (Telegram, twitter, stake pool websites) and none of them give SPOs confidence that those who interact with them are in fact delegators.\n\nPoolTool will change this. By creating an avenue for a two-way communication between SPOs and verified stakeholders, we will make it easy for both groups to create positive feedback loops that will create additional value for the ecosystem.\n\nOur platform will provide tools for SPOs to:\n\n*   drive various marketing promotions targeted to their stakeholders\n*   provide additional services exclusively to their stakeholders\n*   communicate with verified stakeholders through interactive chats\n*   gauge stakeholder value by reviewing an array of stakeholder metrics such as stakeholder loyalty score, which would act like a credit score and allow SPOs to tailor their subscription services to different tiers of stakeholders.\n\nPoolTool is already used by SPOs to \"claim\" their pools. With this project, we plan to offer a way for stakeholders to verify themselves, without revealing their identity, as delegators for specific pools. Doing so would allow them to access a special dashboard where they would be able to interact and access pool services.\n\nYou can find additional details in the attached pdf file.",

    "description": "This podcast was first called for by Charles Hoskinson, he called it the use & utility podcast in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1BgTNmn2AM&t=302s\n\nMy plan for this podcast is to create a new live episode every week featuring valuable members from the community. There are a lot of ideas already in the short time that cardano.ideascale.com has been available, people will need a way to get their ideas out to the community. I will allow anyone to contact me and tell me what they are building at my email **peyton@bloompool.io**. During the podcast the guests will have the chance to demo the product live or to just talk. The main goal for the guest is to tell the community how their proposal/project will bring or has already brought value to the ecosystem. It's also important that while they're on my platform that viewers will have the opportunity to ask them questions about the information that the guest gave during the podcast. Fifteen minutes at the end of every podcast will be dedicated to answering viewers questions in an AMA style. I will also create a second channel and spend time curating clips from the original podcast into 10-20 minute videos for people that do not have the time to watch the whole podcast. The podcast will also be uploaded to all major platforms including Spotify, Google Podcast, Apple podcasts, and more.\n\nI wanted to answer a little more on the question \"What problem am I trying to solve?\" but I am limited to 140 characters. Here is what I am trying to solve:\n\n\\- Within the Cardano community I speak to talented people everyday whom are building dApps, websites, communities, interests groups, and more. Oftentimes these talented people do not have the time or skills to market their projects and may be too technical for the average community member. I am trying to give these people a platform to display how their projects will bring value to the community, and to also relay the technical information.\n\nTo ensure voters can see the growth of this podcast I will release the analytics of the videos once a month. Here are a few examples of what the data looks like from my past few podcasts/interviews:  \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fi1Q-HWcGAQf8-gj7NrnEXnlwlgoO7vP/view?usp=sharing https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l1R697Pf6iZEFFw2Mm1hVFDhgmBWac6m/view?usp=sharing\n\nYou can find a link to my YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/bigpey\n\nI have already created the podcast to allow you to see if I have the relevant experience. You can find the link the the first podcast with Emurgo's Sebastien Guillemot here: https://youtu.be/xuT1HAyhXKk\n\nThe second episode is with the creator of pooltool, you can watch that episode here(it was awesome!): https://youtu.be/n_q0YkkOVik\n\nHere are the links to the third and fourth episode of the podcast:  \nhttps://youtu.be/oqoN2MIGI9A\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RsNYGFbY6JA",

    "solutionDescription": "Cause-Integrated Marketing PaaS leveraging themoney brands spend on advertising to create sustainable funding for causes impacting all of us",
    "outcomeObjectives": null,
    "description": "OVERVIEW\n\nThis request for funding directly achieves the challenge of encouraging DEVs and Dapps to be built on the Cardano blockchain in the next 6 months, by doing exactly that. The funding provided will help in the creation of the WeThinkItMatters dApp on Cardano and be a Advertising business using Cardano Blockchain. The creation of the dApp will employ multiple DEVs that were not building on Cardano before working on WeThinkItMatters. Our use case on the Cardano blockchain is in a major industry that is spending $500+ BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. And WeThinkItMatters dApp will be an opportunity for people to use Cardano's blockchain in a way that has a positive impact in the world.\n\nImportant things about WeThinkItMatters Inc. and WTIM:\n\n1\\. WeThinkItMatters Inc. is a for-profit business that sells advertising campaigns to other businesses.\n\n2\\. WeThinkItMatters Inc. uses 60% of the money businesses spend advertising on our PaaS to support nonprofits.\n\n3\\. While all other advertising platforms use 0% of their revenue from advertisers to support nonprofits, WeThinkItMatters Inc. uses more than half of our revenue to improve the world.\n\n4\\. WeThinkItMatters Inc. creates new sources of funding for nonprofits with money that was never going to be donated to them, but was going to be spent marketing to you.\n\nPitchdeck: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rwlCzD3UUCEBE3nrl6e0vpEclWVdihkhB-dOXg2F_os/edit?usp=sharing  \n  \nThe Cardano Effect, The Gaunlet WTIM interview https://youtu.be/AYadRfRYnPE  \n\n  \n\nPROBLEM STATEMENTS\n\nFor Businesses, the problem is click fraud and that even if real people are the ones clicking the ADs, those ADs are not really connecting with most people or having a positive impact on them. Also, people are expecting businesses to be better corporate citizens and businesses have to do more than ever to show people how they are helping.\n\nFor Nonprofits, the problem is funding is tight and charities primarily rely on people to support the work they do to improve our communities. Also, nonprofits can't really spend much money on ADs but they still have to compete for the same consumer dollars that businesses are spending over $500+ billion a year on ADs to influence people.\n\nFor People, the problem is they already donate 15X to 20X times more money to Nonprofits than Businesses donate to nonprofits each year. This is while businesses are gaining more wealth and people are losing it a rapid pace. Also, people's attention is valuable and businesses spend big money for it, but people don't get anything from that spend.\n\n  \n\nOUR SOLUTION\n\nWeThinkItMatters Cause-Integrated Marketing Platform as a Service (PaaS) where Businesses get a better ROI from the money they spend on advertising campaigns,\n\nand nonprofits can get attention without spending money, and get funding in campaigns without having to ask for a donation,\n\nand any person in the world can get the same value for their attention and engagement in the WeThinkItMatters dApp.\n\n  \n\nGOALS\n\nDevelop WTIM's Smart Advertising Contract used in our cause-integrated marketing campaigns to operate on Cardano's blockchain\n\nDevelop WTIM Token and WTIM Share Certificate as Native Assets on Cardano's blockchain that can be traded and exchanged in our private marketplace\n\nCreate WTIM dApp so it is a rewarding experience for people, businesses, and nonprofits by creating funding for causes with money spent by advertisers\n\n  \n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nA dApp consisting of mobile-friendly front-end and scalable back-end designed to work with the Cardano blockchain. An easy to use dashboard where anyone can raise money for nonprofit causes with just the tap of their finger, no donation required. And marketing PaaS that is the most responsible and sustainable place in the world for businesses to advertise.\n\nWeThinkItMatters Campaigns feature a cause, an advertiser, and two nonprofits, and engage people in voting for one of them to get funding from the money the advertiser spent sponsoring the campaign. And then based on all the votes in the campaign funding is paid to the nonprofits, and then later those nonprofits share stories about what that funding received did for their mission, and those stories are shared with the voters.\n\n  \n\nRELEVANT EXPERIENCE\n\nStarting a nonprofit 11 years ago opened my eyes to the challenges nonprofits face in the marketplace, especially when it comes to marketing and trying to get people's attention without spending money on advertising. And now working in the Advertising Industry for the last 10 years I have witnessed a shift and demand for more cause-based and impactful marketing tactics. Also a rapid adoption from brands to become better corporate citizens and use more sustainable business practices. The marketplace is hungry for better ways to do business, and WeThinkItMatters is leading the innovation for marketing ROI and will have unmatched guarantees in the industry because of our Smart Advertising Contract.\n\n  \n\nMILESTONES & TIMELINES\n\nFront-End - Weeks 1-4\n\nWe will work collaboratively with a few developers to create the User Interface so that WTIM campaigns look and work great across all devices, PC, Pads, Phones. The front-end will be built with Vue and deployed in the cloud. It will offer People, Businesses, and Nonprofits a way to register and track the amount of money they raise for nonprofits, their WTIM Tokens, and Share Certificates, and Affiliate stats.\n\nBack-End - Weeks 1-4\n\nWe will work collaboratively with a few developers to create the databases and functions needed to scale quickly and securely interface with the Cardano blockchain. The back-end will be built with Laravel and be deployed in the cloud. It will be able to support any size of growth in traffic and actions on the dApp without issue.\n\nBeta Testing - Weeks 4-8\n\nWe will work collaboratively with the Cardano community and existing WTIM Members to test and refine the dApp before promoting it to the public. We would ensure that all layers of the tech stack are working properly together, and that the dApp was easy for people to use and understand.\n\nDapp Launch - Weeks 8-12\n\nOnce we have a presenting sponsor we will work collaboratively with TechSoup to introduce WeThinkItMatters to their over one million nonprofit partners and let the nonprofits know about our platform that they can use for free to get funding for their ORG. Also Agents of WeThinkItMatters Inc. will promote and market WTIM campaigns to businesses as a place for those businesses to advertise.\n\n  \n\nBUDGET\n\nOur budget benefits other proposals in dcfund, and most of it goes to encourage developers to build tech to operate with Cardano's blockchain\n\n$4,500 \\[already invested $1,500\\] African Blockchain Center for Developers (ABCD) these developers are/will create the Front and Back-end of the Dapp and connect it to the Cardano blockchain -Funds paid to ABCD will encourage DEVs in Africa by paying them to build dApp UI/UX to connect to the Cardano blockchain, and gives them development experiences to share with people who take part in ABCD.\n\n$7,000 \\[already investing $70HR on a weekly basis as I can afford\\] Freelance Haskell DEV (Tin) this developer will create the WTIM Smart AD Contract in Marlowe and WTIM Native Assets that will be used in the Dapp -This developer had never heard of Cardano before I contracted him to teach me Haskell and help me build WTIM, funds paid to him help support his continued learning about Plutus and Marlowe and passing that knowledge on to others.\n\n$4,500 to WeThinkItMatters Inc. S.P.C. agents that will provide Project Management, handle Beta Testing of dApp, create supporting documents for advertisers , nonprofits, and people. The agency will work with all developers to complete the dApp on the 8-12 week timeline and recruit a virtual sales force to market it once ready.\n\n$0 Hosting, Because of WeThinkItMatters involvement in ALTS Capital Accelerator our cloud hosting cost is already sponsored by AWS.\n\n  \n\nFUNDING REQUIREMENTS\n\n$16,000 one-time payment to WeThinkItMatters Inc. S.P.C. who will distribute payments to private contractors based upon agreements in their contracts. The developed WTIM dApp, WTIM Smart AD Contract, and WTIM Native Assets created will belong to WeThinkItMatters Inc S.P.C. and all code will be used by the company for operations of WeThinkItMattersⓇ marketing PaaS. The Smart Contract template code we create will be open source and can be used by others, and portions of our build will be recorded by ADA MarkerSpace to teach others how to build dApps on Cardano.\n\n  \n\nBENEFITS TO CARDANO\n\nWeThinkItMatters dApp would be a consumer and business use case and way for the average person to do something on the blockchain that is meaningful. And WTIM would create transactions on Cardano blockchain through the voting in WTIM campaigns and trading of WTIM assets, thus generating profits for Stake Pool Operators and increasing the utility of ADA and it's value long term. This proposal also employs and helps multiple developers become better at building solutions on top of Cardano.\n\n  \n\nHow WTIM benefits Cardano's ecosystem:\n\nMembers, for people WeThinkItMatters is an easy to use nonprofit fundraising tech that gives people the ability to support causes without having to give money. People already give way more to charities than businesses each year, and WTIM offers them a different way to raise money for causes with money that businesses are spending on advertising. WTIM dApp will be a blockchain App that the average person would use, people don't need to be a crypto fan or care about blockchain to want to support causes, they are already giving their money and time. Members of WeThinkItMatters dApp also get a unique and rewarding experience no one else is offering.\n\nPartners, nonprofits already pay for many different types of fundraising platforms that they then have to ask people to give a donation on. WeThinkItMatters offers nonprofits a free to use platform where they can get funding just from inviting people to join WTIM and take part in campaigns. Nonprofits can leverage their existing email databases and social networks to engage their supporters with fundraising opportunities that don't require the supporter to give money, only take an online action.\n\nAdvertisers, brands and businesses already spend over $500,000,000,000+ a year on advertising. They know getting people's attention is important, and WeThinkItMatters offers them a way to engage with people that has a positive impact on the world. Only with WeThinkItMatters can a brand be guaranteed that 60% of what they spent on an advertising campaign will go to nonprofits. No other marketing platform or media can deliver this KIND of ROI. WeThinkItMatters campaigns also give 3X times more engagement than other channels for a lower cost per click than the AVG digital media.\n\nPlease see this example campaign https://wethinkitmatters.com/campaign/example-cardano-campaign/\n\n  \n\n\\*\"PLEASE CHECK OUT THE ATTACHED WTIM SMART AD CONTRACT WORKFLOW\"\\*",

    "description": "\\----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe original author(Damjan) transferred proposal ownership to Ola\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Overview**\n\nIt was clear from the beginning that creating and managing the necessary keys and running required CLI commands to build and manage your stake pool would be a pain to handle manually. The idea that a tool was needed to easily wrap all the underlying commands needed to perform the tasks required by a stake pool operator was evident. CNTools was born and quickly gained traction. In the last four months, since the launch of the Haskell TestNet, a lot of work has been put in and it's now a tool many SPO's rely on to manage their stake pool.\n\nIn addition to CNTools, Guild LiveView was created. It solved the need to be able to monitor the stake pool metrics while at the same time safely be able to run cardano-node as a service.\n\nFunds will be used to continue the development started with these tools. Add new features and fix bugs as they arise. Funds will also be used to sponsor other guild collaborators like the topology updater service hosted by Markus @ CLIO1 that greatly help make the Cardano MainNet network as stable and reliable as it currently is until p2p is fully implemented.\n\n**Impact**\n\nIt's not possible to get an exact estimate on how many stake pools that have been created using CNTools. Based on metadata and some other metrics, I estimate that at least 1/3 of all stake pools have been registered using this tool.\n\n**Risk Assessment**\n\nI'm invested in the project as a stake pool operator and I estimate the risk of being unable to maintain and keep the code up-to-date with upcoming changes or added features as low. The guild repo is open source and as such the tools will always be available for continued development.\n\n**Deliverables / Metrics**\n\nContributions, activity, and continued development can be tracked through the public GitHub repository. New releases will be released on an on-demand basis as changes and/or fixes are needed and features added.\n\nSome highlighted features that are on the ToDo list to be implemented/evaluated but in no way a complete list. Features will be added as they emerge.\n\n*   Security upgrade with offline mode to be able to keep private keys on air-gapped pc. (in the final stage for release 6.0.0)\n*   Mnemonic wallet import (included in 6.0.0)\n*   Multi-sig for payment and pool registration\n*   Usage of separate wallet to pay for transaction fee\n*   Improved block overview with leader schedule/block verification\n*   General-purpose log parser for blocks, pooltool sendmytip etc\n*   Provide a compact pre-built virtual machine with CNTools for offline key signing, cross-platform\n*   Improved documentation to go more into detail about the different features\n*   Video tutorial going over the different parts in detail\n*   …\n\nThe repository is open to post ideas on how to improve the product and I welcome any issue opened for how to make it better.\n\n++Code++:\n\nhttps://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators  \nMy handle: @Scitz0\n\n++Documentation++:\n\nhttps://cardano-community.github.io/guild-operators/#/Scripts/cntools\n\n**IP/Copyright**\n\nOpen source and licensed under MIT License (Expat)\n\n**Costs / Funding**\n\n*Recalculated for 6 months to better match the fund2 challenge and numbers adjusted after reevaluating how much time I think is realistic*\n\nRequested funds are based on my previous contributions to estimate the time that would be needed to maintain and extend the tools provided for a period of 6 months.\n\n++Fund request breakdown++:  \nAt 45 USD per hour, 12 hours per week -> 540 USD per week  \nFor 26 weeks -> 14,040 USD -> ~140,000 Ada @ $0,1\n\nMore time has been spent up until this point to lay the foundation and get the tools and documentation to their current state. I expect this to decline slightly going forward as the tools mature and this is included in the calculation.",

    "solutionDescription": "African Developer Training (then Expertise) Centre specializing in the development,of core Cardano blockchain technologies and applications.",
    "outcomeObjectives": null,
    "description": "**Why Are We Founding the African Blockchain Centre for Developers?**\n\nThe world is now built on code, it's not only brick-and-mortar anymore. Globally, many people don't see an African as a potential world class software engineer. Views about Africa are based on advertisements and media that solicit help for children or other donations. We don't believe that this is the most efficient or a sustainable way to support Africa!\n\nThe African continent is home to an emerging digital ecosystem and a massive, creative, and youthful talent pool. It is time to shine a spotlight on the ready potential of the continent and for a new generation of creators and leaders to rise up. We believe that we must provide the opportunity for people who want to make changes to positively impact society.\n\nAs the world and the role of blockchain continues to develop, we have brilliant African minds that are full of ideas and energy but who lack access to the infrastructure and funds to realize their dreams. We would like to give them the opportunity to learn at an elite level and get them everything they need to turn their ideas and projects into reality.\n\nThe African Blockchain Center for Developers (ABCD) will create opportunities by providing blockchain solutions for the world and by utilizing the pool of talent working remotely in Africa to build solutions for developers, start-ups, enterprises, and governments both on the continent and worldwide. The vision of the ABCD is to help bridge the developer-skills gap in Africa by providing better access to high-quality, world-class skills on blockchain technology.\n\nOur main goal is finding talented and motivated people to provide them with the skills and means necessary to perform at an elite level. Following this, we will give new developers the opportunity to contribute to existing projects, to create their own projects, or to place them with partner companies looking for talent. All of this will in turn contribute to the global developer community on the Cardano network.\n\n  \n\n**An In-Depth Look at the African Blockchain Center for Developers**\n\nThe mission of the African Blockchain Center for Developers is to stimulate the establishment and growth of technology-based start-up companies and other blockchain-enabled businesses.\n\nBy fulfilling this mission, ABCD will concretely contribute to:  \n• Local job creation  \n• Local business development  \n• On-boarding to the global Cardano ecosystem  \n• Creation of Smart contracts and Dapps\n\nTogether with the Cardano Community, ABCD will create, develop and provide open source materials for new and emerging technology specializing in the development of core Cardano blockchain technologies and applications. In both the immediate and long terms, ABCD will facilitate enhanced economic health in Africa while promoting and encouraging adoption of Cardano throughout the continent.\n\nThese achievements will be self-reinforcing: by increasing the successful development of emerging businesses in the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, we will create value and new investment opportunities. By providing training, mentorship, shared space, and professional assistance, we will build a network of experts who will be able to share their expertise with additional developers. By incubating businesses, ABCD will move out into the community and contribute to the overall vitality, diversity, and growth of Cardano in the booming African economy.\n\nABCD will provide an environment that allows Africans to take an active role in \"growing their own\" businesses that will lead to job creation. These new businesses and new jobs produced create wealth through multiplier effects that ultimately benefits the overall community beyond the individuals.\n\n  \n\n**What Will the ABCD Do?**\n\n*Developer Training and skills development*\n\nABCD will train developers and provide a network for collaborators to meet and contribute to the Cardano ecosystem. ABCD will provide value added services customized to their needs at every step of their learning journey within the Cardano and Blockchain environment.\n\n*Business Assistance*\n\nTogether with the Cardano community and active partners, ABCD will help startups through their early development by providing business advice, resources, contacts and technical support services including guidance and mentoring on business strategy, management, marketing, financial, legal, and product development issues as well as connecting startups with investors.\n\n*Facility-Based Services*\n\nABCD will provide developers and start-ups with appropriate rental space and flexible leases, shared business services and equipment, technology support services, and assistance necessary for company growth.\n\n  \n\n**Benefits to Stakeholders**\n\nWhen ABCD reaches its cruising altitude, the center will benefit a wide range of stakeholders.\n\n*How Will ABCD Benefit the Cardano Ecosystem?*\n\nSome of our developers already have promising ideas for some of the most critical issues in Africa. ABCD believes that the public's faith in a blockchain value is one of the key factors for adoption. ABCD not only intends to train developers to service projects within the Cardano community but also provide technical assistance to local communities to solve inherent African problems on the Cardano blockchain by providing an ecosystem that enables blockchain startups to flourish.\n\nWe think that in order to promote and lead to the adoption of Cardano, we need to show everyday people that everything is possible. We will seek to show how useful applications can be developed and integrated into the ecosystem.\n\nIn particular, we seek to create applications for African users that are made by Africans, not just westerners. On a global scale, we believe that the success of Cardano can be measured by the people and for the people.\n\n*How Will ABCD Benefit Youth and the Unemployed?*\n\nABCD ecosystem will enable youths, software engineers, developers and dreamers to kick-start a career in blockchain development, learn Blockchain related skills as well as apply that knowledge in building decentralized applications within Cardano.\n\n*How Will ABCD Benefit Startups?*\n\nStart-ups can collaborate with both local and worldwide entrepreneurs to create partnerships, to meet the unique needs suppliers, and to secure capital. ABCD will help accelerate blockchain startup growth by providing office space and services, mentorship, expertise, influence, and access to capital.\n\nAll of this lowers the overhead and operating costs during critical formative years. A connection to ABCD will significantly increase visibility and presence of companies in the marketplace and advance their success potential.\n\n*How Will ABCD Benefit the African Community?*\n\nABCD will create new employment opportunities in the blockchain space for Africans as well as create higher wage and higher skill jobs.\n\nABCD activities within the region and then the continent will enhance Africa's image as a progressive, future-thinking place that encourages and supports technology business development.\n\nABCD will support the community and government in economic development, provision of skilled workers, and an increased tax base. We will provide increased visibility of host communities and improved entrepreneurship in the blockchain sector.\n\n  \n\n**The ABCD Recruitment and training Process**\n\nOne of the critical steps to guarantee the success of this project on the long term is the quality of recruitment.\n\nWe not only need to find brilliant young developers, we also need to ensure that they will stay within the training center for a period of 3-4 years.\n\nTo establish technical criteria, we will collaborate with the Project Catalyst team and determine the best onramps to the ABCD.\n\nTo start, we have already pre-selected 15 young developers including young talented women. These people will have a solid IT and dev background and are already operational to develop applications in several useful languages (Java, Javascript, Python, etc.). ABCD recruits will continue to learn Haskell, Plutus and Marlowe in order to be able to develop their first Dapp as soon as Goguen is available.\n\nRegarding the materials and educators, we are in close contacts with Lars Brünjes and his team for materials. A 10 weeks Haskell course (including 4 weeks on Plutus and Marlowe) have been completed remotely (due to Covid-19) in Mongolia. Once ABCD actually has all its infrastructure ready and when IOG's team is available virtual training sessions is feasible. We have also been in touch with John O'connor in Ethiopia where IOG has trained 20+ students in Haskell. We will work with them to create educational content based on our experience following the launch of ABCD and to organize remote training sessions\n\n  \n\n**Proposed organizational structure for ABCD in Port Harcourt, Nigeria**\n\n*Staffing*\n\nIn order to efficiently manage and run the ABCD, we will need a support team that maximizes the ability of our developers to dedicate themselves to \"learning and coding\".\n\nFor that purpose, we plan to recruit the following roles:  \n• Head of center  \n• Secretary/receptionist  \n• Security\n\nThe ABCD staff would oversee the day to day activities of the center as well as manage facilities. Subsequent increases in staff strength will depend on increases in workload and funding availability.\n\nLonger term, the ABCD hopes to foster a blossoming network of professional developer teams throughout the African Continent.\n\nProject director and lead coordinator will be Cardano Ambassador Joshua Akpan. Joshua is known throughout the Cardano Community for his leadership and coordination of Blockchain Meetups, host on The Cardano Community, AfroFinLab and POA Podcasts, boots on the ground, collaborator and advocate for Proof of Africa (POA), Cardano Shelley Summit 2020 Presenter, and Social Media Evangelist for Cardano.\n\n  \n\n**ABCD Venue**\n\nWe have conducted prospects for finding ABCD's offices (rental) and some interesting ones have been selected.\n\nAmong them, one on the Woji Road, GRA Phase 2, Port Harcourt, Rivers retains our attention.\n\nThis place will allow a team of up to 60 people with open offices, meeting rooms, conference rooms, etc. in a secure area.\n\nUntil ABCD reaches its critical size, offices and services will be sub-rented to other businesses.\n\n  \n\n**Long-Term Continuation Plan**\n\nWithin the next 10 years, we intend to develop the project progressively increasing the number of attendees and then expand the initiative in other countries.\n\nLong term activities of ABCD will be:\n\n*Blockchain Training/Education*\n\nABCD will train and enable entrepreneurs to launch a career in blockchain and Hyper-ledger Fabric and gain the essential knowledge and expertise to develop applications in enterprise environments.\n\nWe will also provide training for scholars, government agencies, corporate bodies, private firms and entrepreneurs that need to know and understand blockchain technology and the benefit of developing their applications on the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n*Direct Business Development Assistance*\n\nABCD will provide oversight and facilitate access to resources in order to stimulate sustainable MSME development by improving their general business environment.\n\n*Professional Network and Relationship Support*\n\nABCD will play an active role in developing links with resources that entrepreneurs might not otherwise have access to as small, emerging businesses.\n\nABCD is already developing a broad-based pool of high-quality professionals that have the technical and business skills needed to support client businesses.\n\n*Educational/Awareness Programs*\n\nABCD will build and maintain up-to-date information resources for technology start-ups as well as host on-site seminars, meet-ups, hackathons and other events of interest to technology start-ups.  \n*Facility-Based Services*\n\nABCD will provide clients with appropriate rental space and flexible leases, shared business services and equipment, technology support services, and assistance necessary for company growth.\n\n  \n\n**Roadmap**\n\nTo reach these ambitious but realistic objectives, we have created a plan to progressively extend our activities following several steps:\n\n*Pilot phase (Year 1)*\n\nTest phase, opening of a permanent center in Nigeria for 15 full-time developers in order to test the format, content, level of the attendees to be able to create a tailor-made program to train and support our developers.\n\n*Phase 1 (Year 2 - 5)Replicate the pilot model at larger scale to allow more attendees to get trained.*\n\nWe already developed a network of more than 50 African developers familiar with Cardano and passionate about the Blockchain ecosystem.\n\n*Phase 2 (From year 3)*\n\nReplicate and expand the training model in different countries in Africa. We already have promising contacts with Abidjan university officials in Ivory Coast and with the Satoshi Centre in Botswana.\n\n*Phase 3 (From year 5)*\n\nOpening of permanent centers across Africa applying the lessons learned from the Nigerian office.\n\n  \n\n**Simple budget and Financial Estimates**\n\nABCD will kick-start operations from a pilot phase (first trimester) estimated at 450 000 ADA.\n\nThe estimate need by the end of 2021 is approximately 3 000 000 ADA.  \nThis amount represents what is needed to fully run ABCD for a year hosting 15 developers and staff. This will be covered by both the projects our developers will work on as well as the kick-start funding we might benefit from.\n\nThis estimate takes into account the different costs :  \n• Safety / Fire / Hazards  \n• Insurance (Full cover)  \n• Power setup (Generators, Inverter, Power-bank, etc.)  \n• Server room (CCTV servers, Internet, networking, wiring, etc.)  \n• Basic working setup (Workstation, display, screen, desks, tables, chairs, whiteboard, etc.)  \n• Conference and meeting rooms (screen, tables, chairs, whiteboard, etc.)  \n• Reception  \n• Kitchen/lounge  \n• Monthly expenses (electricity, internet, cooling/AC, salaries)\n\n  \n\n++*Catalyst Fund – Round 2 (pilot phase 1)*++\n\nIn order to fit into the time frame of the Catalyst project, this estimate takes into account the different costs for 6 weeks.  \nThis amount will be crucial for ABCD to kick-start its activity investing in hardware and in the infrastructure allowing the developers to start working effectively in a stable environment:\n\nInvestment costs :  \n• Power – (Equipment + Installations) : 4 000$  \n• Networks – (Equipment + Installations) : 800$  \n• Workstations : 6 800$  \n• Laptops : 1 200$  \n• Raspberry Pi : 600$  \n• Display/screens (training room) : 750$  \n• Desks, tables, chairs (training room) : 900$  \n• Whiteboard (training room) : 150$  \n• Miscellaneous : 1 000$  \nTotal investment costs : 16 200$\n\nRecurring costs (6 weeks) :  \n• Power – (Rental / Fuel / Elect. / Maint.) : 500$  \n• Networks – (Rental / Subscription) : 400$  \n• Facility\\* – (Rental / Maint.) : 10 000$  \n• Adhoc staff : 2 000$  \n• Safety / Fire / Hazards : 500$  \n• Insurance (Full cover) : 1 000$  \n• Miscellaneous : 1 000$  \nTotal investment costs : 15 400$\n\n  \n**Total costs Catalyst Fund – Round 2 : 31 600$**\n\n  \n\\*the cost of $ 10,000 is for one quarter, being incompressible, we have chosen to show it for the first 6 weeks ($ 0 for the second period of 6 weeks)\n\n  \n\n++*Catalyst Fund – Round 3 (pilot phase 2)*++\n\nIn order to fit into the time frame of the Catalyst project, this estimate takes into account the different costs for 6 weeks :\n\nInvestment costs :  \n• Workstations : 1 500$  \n• Laptops : 500$  \n• Raspberry Pi : 300$  \n• Display/screens (conf. room) : 500$  \n• Desks, tables, chairs (conf. room) : 700$  \n• Miscellaneous : 1 000$  \nTotal investment costs : 4 500$\n\nRecurring costs (6 weeks) :  \n• Power – (Rental / Fuel / Elect. / Maint.) : 500$  \n• Networks – (Rental / Subscription) : 400$  \n• Facility – (Rental / Maint.) : 0$  \n• Adhoc staff : 3 000$  \n• Safety / Fire / Hazards : 500$  \n• Insurance (Full cover) : 1 000$  \n• Miscellaneo...",

    "description": "\\*\\*MY HASKELL EXPERIENCE\\*\\*  \nI am a beginner in Haskell - I only started learning a few months ago because Cardano is built on Haskell. My idea is to create the content as I learn new things myself - I am by no means a Haskell expert.\n\n\\*\\*GENERAL PLAN\\*\\*\n\nThe current challenge of attracting new developers to Cardano involves a problem of the high-barrier entry mostly because of the fact that Cardano is built on the Haskell programming language. In 2019, Haskell accounted for just 0.39% of all active users code on GitHub (https://www.benfrederickson.com/ranking-programming-languages-by-github-users/). This is probably because Haskell is considered a hard language to learn and its popularity is low as most devs today are used to imperative Object-Oriented Programming languages than functional languages such as Haskell.\n\nMy solution to this problem is to bridge the gap between Cardano and developers by creating beginner-friendly Haskell, Plutus and Marlowe materials that can easily be absorbed by everyone. This would lower the entry barrier for new developers wanting to build on Cardano. The content format envisioned are 45-minute videos covering various topics related to development on Cardano (some sections might require part 1 / part 2 videos). These videos would be accompanied by written content that supplements the material and offers an alternative for people who prefer written guides.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nA great idea suggestion from community members @adalapuz and @thiago.ouros that I planned to do in the future:\n\nA live classroom workshop/lecture - this would be a great way to convey knowledge in a more personal environment rather than static videos / written guides. In addition, it would allow to really be able to see how many developers the idea is attracting the number of people attending. However, I think that sort of workshop would be best to design after the initial course content is released. Firstly, because this is a new idea so feedback from the on-demand content will help me gain insights into what needs to be improved/removed/included etc..\n\nOnce I have that information, I could design a much better workshop that could be a one day/few half-days/multiple 1.5 hours live session(s) depending on what is estimated to work best.\n\nSo, I absolutely want to include that in my work, but I'd like to build and improve the core of the material, and then, later on, I can design live workshops/lectures that build on top of it. However, live workshops will probably receive different feedback from static videos so it's important to include them in the proposal as well. Right now, I propose to do a live workshop session after each major chapter of the content covered as both a metric of developer interest and initial feedback to improve future workshops. Initial live workshops proposed at the moment:  \n1) Introduction to Haskell\n\n2) Introduction to Plutus\n\n3) Introduction to Marlowe\n\n  \n\n\\*\\*TOPICS TO COVER\\*\\*\n\nThe following topics can be initially considered as a series of connected courses that build on top of each other (these might get changed around as the education plan improves over time):\n\n  \n\n1) Setting up the dev environment (Plutus Platform, framework libraries)\n\n2) Introduction to Haskell\n\n3) Introduction to Plutus Core and Plutus Tx\n\n\\- Both 2) and 3) would have to be split up into sections such as:  \na) Writing basic Haskell/PlutusTx programs\n\nb) Datatypes\n\nc) Functions\n\nd) Type classes\n\ne) Lifting Values\n\n4) Introduction to Smart Contracts in Cardano\n\na) Introduction to EUTXO\n\nb) Validator Scripts\n\nc) Forging Policies\n\n5) Tokenisation with examples\n\n  \n\nMarlowe can be considered a separate course that is more aimed at non-developers:\n\n1) Introduction to Smart Contracts in Cardano\n\na) Introduction to EUTXO\n\nb) Validator Scripts\n\nc) Forging Policies\n\n2) Smart Contracts exemplified with Marlowe\n\n  \n\n\\*\\*COSTS\\*\\*\n\n1) Equipment - 1100 USD\n\n\\- Canon T3i Digital SLR Camera Body\n\n\\- Canon EF 40mm f/2.8 STM Lens\n\n\\- 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod\n\n\\- SanDisk Extreme 32GB SDHC Memory Card\n\n\\- Sony ECMCS3 Omnidirectional Microphone\n\n\\- Rode smartLav+ Lavalier Microphone\n\n\\- Portable Digital Recorder\n\n\\- MicroSDHC Memory Card\n\n\\- Lighting Kit\n\n\\- Whiteboard\n\n  \n\n2) Time - 12,480 USD\n\nAt 40 USD per hour:\n\n12 hours per week -> 480 USD per week\n\nFor 26 weeks (6 months) -> 12,480 USD\n\n  \n\n3) External suppliers (estimated 3,120 USD for 13 videos)\n\n\\- video editing\n\n  \n\n4) Contingencies - 2500 USD\n\n\\- additional equipment required\n\n\\- additional time required\n\n  \n\n\\*\\*RISKS\\*\\*\n\n1) In case the time required to create the content turns out to be significantly higher than estimated, the contingency funds will cover additional work time\n\n2) If a family or another type of crisis happens and I don't have as much time as I thought - depending on the crisis level, the work could either be frozen for a short time or the remaining funding could be returned\n\n3) If the project turns out to be more complicated than expected, it is possible to break it up into chunks and focus on a chunked part to ensure that it is delivered while the rest is put on hold\n\n  \n\n\\*\\*MILESTONES\\*\\*\n\n1) Recording equipment set-up\n\n2) A milestone for each topic/section listed above recorded and delivered\n\n3) For each section released, an analytics report on video performance that will guide future improvements\n\n  \n\n\\*\\*IP/Copyright\\*\\*\n\nAll IP and licensing will remain vested with me.

These public, free services will ease adoption of Cardano by providing infrastructure for initial setup and testing of ideas, therefore encouraging developers to start building by reducing the time invested from days to minutes.\n\n*Cardano Starter Kits (CSKs)* are open source, Project Based Learning (PBL) opportunities for people to engage with Cardano in the real world, and to learn through experience what the Cardano platform can do. CSKs consist of smart contract code, voting apparatus, guided learning materials, and implementation tips. CSKs will support users to learn about Cardano while also producing real-world outcomes, and will vary in complexity, for everyone from beginners to experts. CSKs will not be \"grab and go\", but are grounded in the understanding that we learn best by doing (experiential learning). Anyone who is interested will be able to build upon open source CSKs to start local businesses and to host local events that drive hands-on understanding of Cardano.\n\n*GimbaLabs* is building a platform for sharing APIs and CSKs that allow users to share experiences about what works, what they've learned, and how to improve our open source resources. Community members will also be able to contribute their own APIs and CSKs, supporting our intention to make GimbaLabs a valuable resource for the Cardano commons.\n\n**Our Mission**\n\nMobilizing everyone in the Cardano community by creating tools and real-world use cases that ignite the public imagination and facilitate adoption.\n\n**Our Vision**\n\nA world where as many people as possible are empowered to solve problems using the Cardano platform.\n\n**Value Proposition**\n\nGimbaLabs will create value and generate return on intention along three pathways.

    "description": "*{Please find attached a copy of this detailed plan section with working reference links}*\n\n**++Purpose of the Project Proposal++**\n\n*   Responding to the immense opportunities West Africa presents for Cardano blockchain adoption and the continent's well-documented barriers to adoption of cutting edge digital solutions, the proposers of this Project (West Africa Decentralized Alliance, WADA) seek 297825 ADA **++for an initial 3 (three) month period++** from November 15, 2020, to February 15, 2021, to begin entrenching Cardano's cutting-edge solutions in the subregion and diaspora. This is the beginning of our three-year long-term capacity-building goal to accelerate the creation of dapps and businesses and attract new entrepreneurs into the Cardano ecosystem who are attuned to solving local problems.\n    \n*   Our focus will be to work with local communities to remove barriers to adoption through identifying opportunities and building understanding and enabling in implementing digital identity solutions, decentralized finance and access to global markets, product authentication, and traceability solutions. We will carry out the day-to-day activities of research, project implementation, public relations, advocacy, marketing, community engagement, and education using a decentralized, cost-effective, and innovative approach to contribute to Cardano's overall Africa strategic intentions of bringing blockchain enterprise solutions to the continent. \\[1\\] Ultimately and after the 3-year lifespan of this project, we aim to evolve to become a venture capitalist type organization dedicated to growing West African startups dedicated to building on the Cardano protocol.\n    \n\n**++Strategic Landscape++**\n\n*Africa*\n\n*   Africa is the world's second-largest and second most-populous continent after Asia with a wide range of and abundant natural resources. However, the continent is the least wealthy per person throughout the world. *\"According to a 2014 UK report, Africa receives about $133.7 billion each year from official aid, grants, loans to the private sector, remittances, etc. But at the same time, some $191.9 billion is extracted from the continent in the form of debt repayments, multinational company profits, illicit financial flows, brain drain, illegal logging and fishing etc. And more recent figures put the outflow much higher – at over $218 billion. In other words, Africa suffers a net loss of more than $85 billion every year. Such a net outflow suggests that far from the West aiding Africa, it is Africa that is aiding the West.\"* Firoze 2018 (Should the West Stop Giving Aid to Africa?)\n*   Despite Africa's wealth challenges, recent economic expansion and the large and young population (average population age of 19 years compares favourably with the world population average age of 30 years) make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context. \"*Healthy economies are a function of the age of its people. Those with older economies are dying economies, or rearranging economies. This is the case, to some degree with the US, China, Japan, and Europe. The weight of the aging people put on these economies will be significant. Africa is the opposite. It has the youngest population and thus will have the most robust economy of the future. The opportunity here is therefore immense. Also, it's a way to reimagine how an economy can work. African and those of African descent tend to have a culture of the community. Connecting people in communities and connecting communities to communities is an opportunity awaiting our solution(s)*\".-Sidney Nicholas; AfroFinLab\n\n*Diaspora*\n\n*   From 2010 to 2019, the buying power of Blacks in the US increased a modest but significant 48.1% \\[2\\] And it's well documented the contribution of the overall diaspora for African development \\[3\\]\n*   Ghana (West Africa), in the realization of the power of the African diaspora, launched the much-publicized '2019: Year of return for African Diaspora\"\n\n*West Africa*\n\n*   Through the work of IO Global (IOG), Cardano has made inroads into the East and South African regions but not much presence in the West African subregion\n*   West Africa with its population of nearly 377 million, annual GDP of $614,916M and a debt to GDP percentage of only 36.59% in 2018 (Compare: US debt to GDP of 78% in 2018) shows a big upside for economic expansion and is keen to catch up with the West through emerging technological developments and offers an immense opportunity for international investments and therefore a large potential market for what Cardano has to offer.\n*   The growth of the Mobile Money economy has been explosive in West Africa with Ghana alone seeing a 45% increase in mobile money transactions in 2019 \\[5\\] The market is however capitalized by high fees, interests, and transaction costs and is therefore ripe for blockchain technology disruption in the areas of finance and micro-lending\n*   Tailored Cardano enterprise solutions such as Atala Prism, Atala Trace, and Atala Scan will address numerous challenges on the continent as a whole and West Africa in particular.\n*   Indeed, Senegalese-American celebrity Akon realizes the West African potential for emerging technology and has secured of $6 billion funding to begin construction of Akon City ('futuristic cryptocurrency themed city') in the West African country of Senegal \\[6\\] with phase 1 set to complete in 2023\n*   Cardano's current approach of intermittent high profile country visits to spread Cardano and general blockchain awareness or community meet-ups although making for powerful messaging and awareness creation is not a sustainable model in the West Africa subregion due in part to regional socio-economic challenges as well as local political continuity and/or capability to see commitments through.\n*   Due to historical challenges and political fragmentation resulting from colonialism, the West Africa subregion alone has 18 distinct Anglophone and Francophone countries- and the region lacks the technological base and cohesion to enable blockchain technology to spread organically\n*   The current socio-economic and development landscape forecasts a growing presence of competing blockchain enterprises and Cardano's current strategy for growing opportunities in the region is not sufficient to compete or fully capitalize on the opportunities.\n*   Within the blockchain space, Cardano has by far the most cutting-edge blockchain technology. This Project (West Africa Decentralized Alliance) seeks to drive blockchain technology inclusion in the West Africa subregion and reverse the trend of almost non-existent dapps, businesses, and entrepreneurs building on Cardano protocol in the region.\n*   The Cardano Community, Foundation, IOG and Emurgo have demonstrated a consistent intention and commitment to make the Cardano protocol a blockchain for the unbanked.\n\n**++Strategic Direction++**\n\n*   This Project will work with the Cardano ecosystem and West African subregional governments and other stakeholders to explore the tokenization of natural resources, improve wider access to financial services in client countries, establish blockchain-based education services in its academic institutions, broaden investor opportunity and decentralized applications and business potential for the Cardano protocol.\n*   It will establish a dynamic presence in a financially challenged region and use a feedback loop of education, awareness creation, problem identification, and blockchain technology to ultimately boost the quality of life of local populations as well as increase Cardano investor returns and overall community engagement.\n*   *\"We need to ensure that blockchain education, problem/inefficiency identification (many times this is the base of innovation), funding, and general awareness on Cardano powered solutions are a key focus for West African nations. What does this mean in action? It means education material being produced for developing financial products in Marlowe/general purpose applications on Plutus are sponsored in African universities for finance/business students to innovate. It means we need to scale up the IOHK Africa team (specifically in Ghana and Nigeria and other West African nations). These are certainly just a few, but I am a firm believer that if we put this technology in the hands of builders (backed with the education and funding) they will seek out the inefficiencies in their local communities and build solutions to solve them\"*. -DC (Dewayne Cameron, Liqwid Protocol, Cardano Community member).\n*   This Project will establish a small subregional local working team on the ground in four central areas of West Africa with the main regional hub in Accra, Ghana. Accra has long been the strategic headquarters for key African and West African institutions including the just ratified African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) which the World Bank estimates will lift 30 million people out of extreme poverty. The fact that the Ghana Government in Accra has established a Diaspora Engagement Policy and the President is the current Chairman of ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) ensures proximity for the Project's top-down, bottom-up approach to driving adoption.\n*   The main and subregional working teams will be managed by a team of international volunteer Cardano Community expertise with combined skills in project management and coordination, communications and networking, legal/accounting reporting, and fundraising. This will ensure a high degree of accountability and ensure continued funding for the life of this project.\n\n*Activities over the lifespan of the Project*\n\n*   ++Research++: The focus of our research is to work with communities to discover challenges and opportunities for Cardano protocol solutions.

Being attuned to developments within the Cardano ecosystem and the local communities will keep us aware of issues on the horizon whilst allowing for 6 to 12 weeks planning cycles to allow for short windows to correct as needed. We will include periodic retrospectives to ask questions of both ourselves and stakeholders. Is what we are doing working as planned? Should we either pivot direction or adjust our processes? Meanwhile, we will endeavor to report transparently outwards including failures and lessons learned\n\n\\-For each 6 to 12 weeks planning cadence, we will monitor:\n\n*   \\-Identified existing developers and businesses in West Africa willing to create on the Cardano protocol\n*   \\-New developers recruited or trained for the Cardano ecosystem\n*   \\-New businesses willing to create on the Cardano protocol\n*   \\-New active and engaged Cardano Ambassadors in unique local communities\n*   \\-Educational institutions willing to include blockchain education in their curriculum\n*   \\-Active Cardano memberships or hubs formed with small business spin-offs\n*   \\-Increase in Cardano protocol transactions originating from West Africa\n*   \\-Agreements including MOUs signed with West African Governments and regional entities to adopt Cardano protocol solutions\n*   \\-Alliances formed with other regional blockchain and poverty reduction stakeholders\n*   \\-Degree of public engagement with our marketing and social media plan\n\n**++Risk Management++**\n\n*Some risks we anticipate and ways to mitigate are*\n\n*   ++International and local travel restrictions due to the Covid19 pandemic++++:++ For our initial 6 to 12 weeks, we will focus our work online as we continue to assess the global impact of Covid19.
